This is a review of journals in the area of using Artificial Intelligence for Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems. The journals have discussed the milestones that have been achieved in the area of network security particularly intrusion detection. They has also highlighted several Machine Learning algorithms that can be applied in this area to improve the IDS systems.
Four articles have been reviewed titled as follows: -
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Automatic Detection and Correction of Vulnerabilities using Machine Learning by Robin Tommy and others.
  \item Machine Learning Classification Model For Network Based Intrusion Detection System by Sanjay Kumar and others
  \item Preventing Attacks and Detecting Intruder for Secured Wireless Sensor Networks by Gauri Kalnoor and Jayashree Agarkhed
  \item Web Application Security: Threats, Countermeasures, and Pitfalls by Hsiu-Chuan Huang and others.
\end{enumerate}
The following text describes a brief overview of what these articles have reviewed in this field.
