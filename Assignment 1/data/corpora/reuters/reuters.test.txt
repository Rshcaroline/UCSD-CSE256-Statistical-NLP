JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY , MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U . S . tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17 , industry analysts said .

They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system , which came into effect last month .
But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output , together with Iran " s inability to export as much as its quota allows .
The Saudi figures include a 200 , 000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production .

Qatar ' s February output was 230 , 000 bpd , and this fell to 180 , 000 bpd in early March compared with its 285 , 000 bpd quota .
Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar " s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers .

However , much of that export demand seems to have been met , with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months .
U . S . processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter , so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest , soyproduct dealers said .
" But they ' ve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered , if not tomorrow , then later in the month ," he added .

Production of Indonesia " s staple food , rice , is forecast to fall to around 26 . 3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26 . 58 mln tonnes in 1986 , according to the annual report on Indonesia " s agricultural performance .
" Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane , rubber and copra show little or no gain ," the report says .
" The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans , palm oil and palm kernels ."

STUDY PREDICTS U . S .
CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987 China ' s grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand , but will be not be as large as in the past , Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters .
They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large - scale imports , which peaked at 16 . 15 mln tonnes in 1982 .
An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year , against 7 . 73 mln in 1986 and 5 . 97 mln in 1985 .
Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand , but remained below exports , which rose to 9 . 42 mln tonnes from 9 . 33 mln in 1985 .
" China is short of foreign exchange ," the Shanghai official said .
" At current prices , China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports , though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs ," the trader said .
Since January , the press has devoted much attention to grain , stressing that growth in output is vital to China ' s economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low .
Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output .
The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000 .
" The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption .
