Tokyo - Bundesbank ' s Schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates
With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark , Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed .
" We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter ," he said in an interview .
Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions , just as occured in 1986 .

The recent widening of interest rate differentials , the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar , he said .

However , there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986 / 87 harvest may never be officially registered .

U . S . OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT Senior U . S . Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets .
Beryl Sprinkel , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , reiterated the Reagan Administration ' s opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth .
He also suggested a line - item veto , which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it , to limit wasteful spending .
Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely .
" Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long - run consequences of tax reform ," Sprinkel said .
Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit .
" Contrary to the conventional wisdom , therefore , the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years ," Sprinkel said .
However , the Congressional Budget Office ' s Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided .
" The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level ," Penner said .

CATTLE BEING PLACED ON FEED LIGHTER THAN NORMAL Most of the cattle now being placed on U . S . feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on feed longer , spreading out marketings and supporting cattle prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply .
Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to obtain , industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas .
If the average weight is down , and there is no price weakness to delay marketings , the cattle would be marketed at lighter weights , which could reduce the beef supply as much as three pct .
Bruce Ginn , cattle analyst for The Helming Group ( formerly LBAS ), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly because of two factors : low grain prices and higher live cattle prices .
Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain supplies are large , he noted .
Also , the higher live cattle prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from wheat pasture onto feedlots , Ginn said .
Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions .

" It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City ," which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest .

Call money fell in quite active trading today , dropping to 3 . 40 / 50 pct from 3 . 55 / 65 pct yesterday , and below the 3 . 50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month - end approached .
One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said , " I don ' t think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens .
Ute Geipel , economist with Citibank AG , said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy , raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term , unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands .
As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process , Geipel said .
In the current round , the country ' s most powerful union , the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers , is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38 - 1 / 2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages .
Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April , ahead of the traditional holiday period in June .
Though many economists said the unions ' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984 ' s damaging seven - week strikes , others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict .

FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp , Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy , but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought .
The exception , he said , would be Texas , where he said most of the banks are already well managed , but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy .
Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica , saying only , " We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us ."
Outside California , Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp , with its recent acquisitions in Arizona , Washington and Oregon , is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated .
" Security is , has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company ," he said .
Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked , he said , " I don ' t think it has bottomed out , because I think most of the problems are real estate - related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years ."
On the banking industry in general , Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses , with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits .
The company said it has been granted options to increase its equity stake during 1987 .
