[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ]
VOLUME I
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .
It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .
The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day .
She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
" Poor Miss Taylor !-- I wish she were here again .
" I cannot agree with you , papa ; you know I cannot .
But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?"
Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you !"
It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her .
" But you must have found it very damp and dirty .
Look at my shoes .
I wanted them to put off the wedding ."
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
How did you all behave ?
" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by ."
What a horrible idea !
I meant only myself .
Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .
Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one .
Oh no !
And as to my poor word ` success ,' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it .
You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all .
" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .
CHAPTER II
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away .
There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs . Perry drank tea with Mrs . and Miss Bates , or when Mrs . and Miss Bates returned the visit .
She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .
There was no recovering Miss Taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr . Woodhouse .
His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself .
There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr . Woodhouse would never believe it .
Not unfrequently , through Emma ' s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him .
After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
Mrs . Goddard ' s school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands .
The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .
The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .
_She_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners .
I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you .
Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart -- a _very_ little bit .
Two such could never be granted .
She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .
" Well done , Mrs .
Mrs . Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her ."
His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry .
Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old !"
" Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence .
Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet ."
" To be sure , so it is .
" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse .
He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion .
Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr . Robert Martin .
Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .
He did not think we ever walked this road .
He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet .
What do you think of him ?
I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here ."
" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .
You must see the difference ."
" I wonder he did not remember the book "-- was all Harriet ' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself .
He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .
Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ?"
She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict .
The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .
He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .
And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .
CHAPTER V
" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle ."
We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with .
But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma .
She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding .
She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident .
But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield .
But I am a partial old friend ."
oh !
Mrs . Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm ."
It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you cannot be surprized , Mr . Knightley , at this little remains of office ."
I have a very sincere interest in Emma .
" So do I ," said Mrs . Weston gently , " very much ."
It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object .
She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature ."
" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ," said the gallant Mr . Elton --
So much superadded decision of character !
" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure .
I almost long to attempt her likeness myself .
It would be such a delight to have her picture !"
She thinks so little of her own beauty .
Did not you observe her manner of answering me ?
Mrs . Weston again , and again , and again , you see .
That ' s very like .
Mr . Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , " No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe .
No husbands and wives ," with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once .
Mr . Elton was only too happy .
There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr . Elton ' s very promising attachment was likely to add .
" By all means .
Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .
The naivete of Miss Smith ' s manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable !
he could ride to London at any time .
I come in for a pretty good share as a second .
He will connect himself well if he can ."
Emma was not sorry to be pressed .
She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a " Well , well ," and was at last forced to add , " Is it a good letter ?
" Yes , indeed , a very good letter ," replied Emma rather slowly --" so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him .
A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it ,) than I had expected ."
" But what are you in doubt of ?
You must answer it of course -- and speedily ."
" No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ?
Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do ."
This is a point which you must settle with your feelings ."
For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say ,
" Oh !
You must be the best judge of your own happiness .
Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion .
While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving .
That would have been too dreadful !-- What an escape !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ."
" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
You would have thrown yourself out of all good society .
" Dear affectionate creature !-- _You_ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm !-- _You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life !
I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it .
He must have a pretty good opinion of himself ."
" Oh no ;-- and it is but a short letter too ."
She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr . Elton .
You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey - Mill ."
" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield ."
Some time afterwards it was , " I think Mrs . Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened .
Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes .
Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much .
" My picture !-- But he has left my picture in Bond - street ."
Emma will be happy to entertain you .
I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you ."
" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ?"
" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps ."
" Highbury gossips !-- Tiresome wretches !"
He presently added , with a smile ,
" Indeed !
He is desperately in love and means to marry her ."
" He is very obliging ," said Emma ; " but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?"
He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage .
" Certainly ," replied he , surprized , " I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred .
" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her .
A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her ."
Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ?
She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations .
My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him .
But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .
What !
" Whoever might be her parents ," said Mr . Knightley , " whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society .
After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs . Goddard ' s hands to shift as she can ;-- to move , in short , in Mrs . Goddard ' s line , to have Mrs . Goddard ' s acquaintance .
Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough .
Depend upon it he had encouragement ."
" You are a very warm friend to Mr . Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess ."
I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
Oh !
Harriet may pick and chuse .
Were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you .
Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other ,) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master ' s son ."
She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet ."
The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words .
Emma laughed and disclaimed .
He continued ,
" If I had set my heart on Mr . Elton ' s marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself .
He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly .
She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ' s wrong , as Mr . Knightley .
He had frightened her a little about Mr . Elton ; but when she considered that Mr . Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr . Knightley ' s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about .
Mr . Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr . Elton .
It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ' s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies .
" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them !
Elton ?"
" Oh no !
He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse "-- he stopt a moment --" or Miss Smith could inspire him ."
He was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause ,
But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself .
_Courtship_ -- a very good hint .
I give you credit for it .
Mr . Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you .
An excellent charade indeed !
I have not an idea -- I cannot guess it in the least .
Do you think it is a good one ?
shark is only one syllable .
It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it .
Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ?"
Give me the paper and listen .
their luxury and ease .
That is _ship_ ;-- plain as it can be .-- Now for the cream .
I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .
I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart .
" This is an alliance which , whoever -- whatever your friends may be , must be agreeable to them , provided at least they have common sense ; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools .
How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you .
This charade !-- If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it ."
" I never read one more to the purpose , certainly ."
They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them .
But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it .
no -- I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it .
it is no difficulty to see who you take after !
If I had but her memory !
I hope we shall have her here next week .
" I do not know , my dear .
" We must ask Mr . and Mrs . Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here ."
Mr . Woodhouse could never allow for Mr . Knightley ' s claims on his brother , or any body ' s claims on Isabella , except his own .
I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us .
She and the children might stay very well ."
I am sure I do not know who is not ."
I think their father is too rough with them very often ."
" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much .
here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it .
Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."
After this speech he was gone as soon as possible .
CHAPTER X
" There it is .
There go you and your riddle - book one of these days ."
" I wish we could contrive it ," said she ; " but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father ."
" I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry .
But between _us_ , I am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried ."
but what shall you do ?
Woman ' s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation .
" Do you know Miss Bates ' s niece ?
They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded .
dear , no ," said her companion .
" Ah !
The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting .
This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .
The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs . John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
Nothing wrong in him escaped her .
Mr . Woodhouse ' s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed .
And dear Emma , too !-- What a dreadful loss to you both !-- I have been so grieved for you .-- I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her .-- It is a sad change indeed .-- But I hope she is pretty well , sir ."
" Oh !
" Very much to the honour of both ," was the handsome reply .
" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ?"
They are very , very kind in their visits .
" There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and I have not heard him mentioned lately ."
He is but young , and his uncle , perhaps --"
" Three - and - twenty !-- is he indeed ?-- Well , I could not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother !
Emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr . Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .
She hoped they might now become friends again .
Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,
" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .
I was sixteen years old when you were born ."
" But still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently ."
" Ah !-- Indeed I am very sorry .-- Come , shake hands with me ."
And how tired you must be after your journey !
It makes me envious and miserable ;-- I who have never seen it !
" Oh !
good Mr . Perry -- how is he , sir ?"
do the children grow ?
" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention .
Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."
" No , I do not know that Mr . Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except --
I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town ;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _we_ are so remarkably airy !-- Mr .
Now I cannot say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present ."
" My dear Isabella ,"-- exclaimed he hastily --" pray do not concern yourself about my looks .
And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella ' s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising .
Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet ."
This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation .
South End is an unhealthy place .
" Ah !
It seemed to him a very ill - judged measure ."
" True , true ," cried Mr . Knightley , with most ready interposition -- " very true .
Mr . Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions ;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it .
It was a delightful visit ;-- perfect , in being much too short .
Mr . Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day ;-- even Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
Harriet , Mr . Elton , and Mr . Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ;-- the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr . Woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .
They joined company and proceeded together .
But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr . Elton ' s only objection , and Mr . Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction .
With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works ."
" Mr . Elton ' s manners are not perfect ," replied Emma ; " but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal .
" Me !"
I think your manners to him encouraging .
The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time .
He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing .
Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the " Very true , my love ," which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all .
" Oh !
Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment .
I was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .
Nothing could be pleasanter .
I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se ' nnight ."
Mr . John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly ,
" I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls ."
Well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment ."
Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .
Mr . Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ' s coming , and of Emma ' s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs . Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .
She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of .
That Mr . and Mrs . Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations .
" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .
She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case ," replied Emma ; " but am disposed to side with you , Mr . Weston .
" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs . Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world ."
" My Emma !"
Mrs . Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him ."
It is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery .
Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"
While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying ,
There is jealousy .
" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite .
CHAPTER XV
Mr . Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .
" Did she know ?-- had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls ?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably ."
But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet ' s -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint .
He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house .
replied he .
Isabella turned to Mrs . Weston for her approbation of the plan .
To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father ' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls .
" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?"
" I am ready , if the others are ."
" Yes , do ."
And the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for .
A few minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over .
And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind .
They must keep as much together as they could ;" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage .
Without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence , Mr . Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover .
you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please ."
After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible !
who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
It would be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing this -- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost .
Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?"
I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith !-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received --"
" Encouragement !-- I give you encouragement !-- Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it .
But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting .
Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet ' s friend .
He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten .
Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .
The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior .
The first error and the worst lay at her door .
" Ah !
These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield .
He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body .
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield .
It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening .
Mrs . Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression .
These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs . Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .
" I do not know why you should say so .
If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January .
It is Frank Churchill ' s duty to pay this attention to his father .
Mr . Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him !-- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could !-- How can you imagine such conduct practicable ?"
He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do .
You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones .
" Then it would not be so strong a sense .
If it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction ."
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission .
Cannot you imagine , Mr . Knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ?
" And mine ," said Mr . Knightley warmly , " is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing !
What !
They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs . and Miss Bates .
And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ;' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning ,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized .
I am extremely happy .
My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well .
with the help of spectacles .
Jane speaks so distinct !
My mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least .
Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr . Dixon , I mean -- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs . Campbell were very particular about their daughter ' s not walking out often with only Mr . Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself .
He is a most charming young man .
Dixon !"
Bates ?"
She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .
" It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world ."
So sudden !-- You may guess , dear Miss Woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in !
poor Jane is ill !'
Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her ."
But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny .
The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements .
That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents .
The good sense of Colonel and Mrs . Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did .
Emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought !
It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .
Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance .
In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr . Dixon ' s actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first .
She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious !
It did her no service however .
The like reserve prevailed on other topics .
She and Mr . Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time .
I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ' s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation .
" I had .
" She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one ' s eyes from .
a great pity indeed !
" That ' s right , my dear , very right .
He had time only to say ,
My dear Miss Woodhouse -- I come quite over - powered .
" Where could you possibly hear it , Mr . Knightley ?
He had just read Elton ' s letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly ."
My dear sir , you really are too bountiful .
my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us .
We may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage .'
The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins .
" Mr . Elton going to be married !"
cried Emma .
He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath -- but she says it did him no lasting benefit .
And Mr . Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him .
" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news .
You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ' s account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ."
I do not pretend to it .
What is before me , I see .
She knows I would not offend for the world .
Oh !
" Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away .
The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy .
I shall just go round by Mrs . Cole ' s ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower !-- We think she is the better for Highbury already .
I shall not attempt calling on Mrs . Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing .
Oh !
Mr . Knightley is coming too .
The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the " Oh !
Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened !"
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me --( do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ?)
But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?
He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .
During his present short stay , Emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air .
The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage .
She was good enough for Mr . Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet ' s side .
Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet ' s mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations .
The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin ' s calling at Mrs . Goddard ' s a few days afterwards .
But Mr . Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares .
It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance !--
She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour .
They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when Mrs . Martin ' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner .
The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary .
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well .
" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield ," said he , at the conclusion .
Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing .
When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .
"' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .
I am sure they will bring him soon ."
They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr . Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank ' s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency .
His manner had no air of study or exaggeration .
And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
" You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs . Weston for my feelings ," said Emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .
Her own father ' s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance .
True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is .
And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ."
" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ?"
They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way ."
Mr . Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , " My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs . Bates ' s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump ."
The next morning brought Mr . Frank Churchill again .
Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr . Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm .
She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs . Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father ' s father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards Highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with .
A very successful visit :-- I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint .
If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me .
As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit .
" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill .
But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs . Weston , is it ?
" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."
" Did you see her often at Weymouth ?
Were you often in the same society ?"
I do admire your patriotism .
It is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance .
Miss Fairfax must already have given her account .-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow ."
you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .
But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her ."
I met her frequently at Weymouth .
said Emma , laughing .
They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself .
But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr . Dixon , one may guess what one chuses ."
And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."
One cannot love a reserved person ."
" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater .
There must be ample room in it for every real comfort .
Used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one .
Mrs . Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether .
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , " Hum !
Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .
The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls .
The Coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them .
Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s accounting for it with " I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ," was not quite sufficient .
She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept .
She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party .
He was soon pretty well resigned .
I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening .
He had a great regard for Mrs . Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her .
" But , my dear sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party ."
You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr . Cole is very bilious .
You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends ."
I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs . Weston , but on your account .
I am only afraid of your sitting up for me .
He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself :--
Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly .-- It depends upon the character of those who handle it .
Mr . Knightley , he is _not_ a trifling , silly young man .
for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner ."
You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances .
You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed .
" Nay , why do you ?"
" Very ."
" What do you say to Mrs .
" If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_ .
Dixon .-- Very well .
We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance ."
I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries ."
" And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells ."
She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them .
" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced .
There was no occasion to press the matter farther .
She was his object , and every body must perceive it .
And she , " Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr .
Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech .
He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room -- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could -- that his father , Mr . Knightley , Mr . Cox , and Mr . Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families -- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much .
She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked .
His importance at Enscombe was very evident .
The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
I never knew days fly so fast .
" Thank you for rousing me ," he replied .
I see nobody else looking like her !-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion .
How else could they come ?"
` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself !'
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
In short , I have made a match between Mr . Knightley and Jane Fairfax .
Knightley !-- Mr .
" Yes , I would .
And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !"
My dear Mrs . Weston , do not take to match - making .
" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad .
Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable ."
" Nonsense !
In the way of love , I am sure he does not .
He would do any good to her , or her family ; but --"
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , laughing , " perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home ."
" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion .
But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do .
I have a very strong notion that it comes from him .
She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .
With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen .
Frank Churchill sang again .
But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
A Mrs . Knightley for them all to give way to !-- No -- Mr .
And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell ."
And Frank Churchill was heard to say , " I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling .
Go , and interfere .
He was no dancer in general .
It was growing late , and Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her mother ' s account .
After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs . Weston , look sorrowful , and have done .
Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles .
The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity .
She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing .
" Oh !
" Ah !
I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste .
" Just as they always do -- very vulgar ."
Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing Mr . Elton .
" They told me -- that Mr . Martin dined with them last Saturday ."
A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer .
I should be quite in the way .
" Well -- if you advise it .-- But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I say ?
She might do very well by herself .
A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood ."
We will go to Hartfield afterwards .
and I always thought you meant it ."
You could make it into two parcels , Mrs . Ford , could not you ?"
" No trouble in the world , ma ' am ," said the obliging Mrs . Ford .
then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she cannot refuse .--` Aye , pray do ,' said Mr . Frank Churchill , ` Miss Woodhouse ' s opinion of the instrument will be worth having .'
Jane said so .
Jane came back delighted yesterday .
Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .
I do congratulate you , Mrs . Weston , most warmly .
He seems every thing the fondest parent could .
.
I never shall forget his manner .
So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same .
But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil .
.
" I have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe .
That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
At last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to .
I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize .
She was not obliged to hear .
He paused .
He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more .
She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else .
Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it ?-- He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here .
I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart .
" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways .
Leave shame to her .
If she does wrong , she ought to feel it ."
How is Miss Fairfax ?-- I hope she caught no cold last night .
He cut her short with ,
" Well ," said he , in a deliberating manner , " for five minutes , perhaps ."
You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left .
William Larkins mentioned it here .
You should not have done it , indeed you should not .
Ah !
he is off .
" Oh !
Oh !
Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .
" But will there be good room for five couple ?-- I really do not think there will ."
Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother ' s , and must be invited with the rest .
A word was put in for a second young Cox ; and at last , Mr . Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of .
It seemed the best scheme ; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better .
So you would all .
Mrs . Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing .
He does not think of the draught .
Ten couple may stand here very well ."
" There is no denying it ," he replied .
" I agree with you exactly .
Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest .
Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls .
But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ' s house ."
" Open the windows !-- but surely , Mr . Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls .
interrupted Emma , " there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over .
I do not know her , even by sight ."
" Aye , very true .
I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot .
Mrs . Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper .
She then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed ,
It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs ."
To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be ."
You want your neighbours ' opinions .
If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance .
Shall I call upon them ?
" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates ," said Emma .
" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing .
" Aye , do , Frank .-- Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once .
Enscombe however was gracious , gracious in fact , if not in word .
This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry .
I do look forward to it , I own , with _very_ great pleasure ."
There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love .
Alas !
A letter arrived from Mr . Churchill to urge his nephew ' s instant return .
" Of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst ."
that ball !-- why did we wait for any thing ?-- why not seize the pleasure at once ?-- How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation !-- You told us it would be so .-- Oh !
Do not forget your engagement ."
he continued ; " every day more precious and more delightful than the day before !-- every day making me less fit to bear any other place .
It was better to pay my visit , then "--
He hesitated , got up , walked to a window .
He was silent .
She has been so kind as to promise it .
In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again ."
To complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her .
She had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think Jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health .
Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love .
At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .
I should be sorry to be more ."
It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .
Pray make my excuses and adieus to her ."
This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself .
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation .
My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration .
I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me ."
" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ," said she afterwards to herself .
Dear Harriet !-- I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing .
She did not really like her .
Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant .
Emma thought at least it would turn out so .
yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman ."
And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again .
He is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing .
How delightful !"
Harriet would have been a better match .
Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind .
People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style ."
" Oh !
We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ."
I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling .'
Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion .
Let me recommend Bath to you .
The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood .
" I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs . Elton .
no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea .
I could do very well without it .
To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent .
I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours .
Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright .
Mr . Weston seems an excellent creature -- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you .
Happily , it was now time to be gone .
Absolutely insufferable !
Knightley !-- never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley !-- and discover that he is a gentleman !
I could not have believed it !
Ah !
Mr . Elton knows you ."
" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ?
It ought to be no recommendation to _you_ .
Her mind returned to Mrs . Elton ' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
He seemed not merely happy with her , but proud .
" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse .-- I quite rave about Jane Fairfax .-- A sweet , interesting creature .
So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents .
We must bring her forward .
I like her the better for it .
I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it .-- But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing .
You and I need not be afraid .
You may have done wrong with regard to Mr . Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited !-- The kindness and protection of Mrs .
She looked on with some amusement .-- Miss Bates ' s gratitude for Mrs . Elton ' s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth .
The decree is issued by somebody .
" We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home .
Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change ."
We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .
are you there ?-- But you are miserably behindhand .
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."
" Well ," said she , " and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?"
He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more .
" In that respect how unlike dear Mrs . Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world !
From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day !-- A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss ."
Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners .
Emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons .
A dinner there must be .
If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home ."
The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at Hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party .-- His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so .
John Knightley came ; but Mr . Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day .
It is my daily errand .
" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine ."
" I have often thought them the worst of the two ," replied he coolly .
I know Mr . John Knightley too well -- I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body .
I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation .
I consider one as including the other .
" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me ."
They are some of my very old friends .
do not tell _me_ .
You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself .-- To the post - office indeed !
Now do not you feel that you had ?
You know , Mrs . Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves .
If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama ' s ."
The public pays and must be served well ."
" I never saw any gentleman ' s handwriting "-- Emma began , looking also at Mrs . Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs . Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , " Now , how am I going to introduce him ?-- Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ?
No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away .
said she , " I get quite anxious about you .
June will soon be here ."
" But I have never fixed on June or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general ."
" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have .
You may imagine how desirable !
But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present ."
Your inexperience really amuses me !
When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed .
" Oh !
" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle .
I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs . Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer .
" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest !-- Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- I assure you I like him excessively .
But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous .
I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown .
John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , " I could not have believed it even of _him_ ."
Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now .
She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy .
It was well that he took every body ' s joy for granted , or he might not have thought either Mr . Woodhouse or Mr . Knightley particularly delighted .
They were the first entitled , after Mrs . Weston and Emma , to be made happy ;-- from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs . Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .
" Oh !
This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- So Frank writes word .
Besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .
Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove .
" When Frank left us ," continued he , " it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ' s news doubly welcome .
and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .
" Very true , Mr . Weston , perfectly true .
And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood .
Your description of Mrs . Churchill made me think of them directly .
They came from Birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , Mr . Weston .
My charge would be much more concise than her ' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them ."
You think so , do not you ?"
But you , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I cannot imagine .
She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him .
They met with the utmost friendliness .
Absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect .
He was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation .
Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago .
Mrs . Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there , and had otherwise a fancy for the place .
Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for May and June .
She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .
Emma saw how Mr . Weston understood these joyous prospects .
Two months must bring it to the proof .
He was quite delighted .
Now , it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood .
One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the Crown .
Mr . Woodhouse was resigned .
May was better for every thing than February .
The day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , Frank Churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached Randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe .
The room at the Crown was to witness it ;-- but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd .
Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr . Weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .
Mrs . Elton was spoken of .
" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax !"
Emma longed to know what Frank ' s first opinion of Mrs . Elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness .
So afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have .
Delighted to hear it indeed .
dear Mrs . Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage !-- excellent time .
There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time .
Does not she , Jane ?-- Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ?-- Ah !
Must go and speak to Dr . and Mrs . Hughes for a moment .-- How do you do ?
Richard ?-- Oh !
there he is .
Much better employed talking to the young ladies .
How do you do , Mr .
Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs . Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her .-- He was thoughtful .
After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , Mrs . Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was , " How do you like my gown ?-- How do you like my trimming ?-- How has Wright done my hair ?"
And I see very few pearls in the room except mine .-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand .-- We shall see if our styles suit .-- A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill .
I like him very well ."
Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming ,
" Oh !
Elton ?"
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .
" She will think Frank ought to ask her ."
That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable .
He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- Emma saw it .
" Me !-- oh !
This was Mr . Elton !
Mr . Churchill , oh !
Excellent dancing indeed !-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me .-- I set off without saying a word , just as I told you .
said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr . George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr . Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr . William Cox .'
Sir , you are most kind .
Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other !-- Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs . Elton is going ; dear Mrs . Elton , how elegant she looks !-- Beautiful lace !-- Now we all follow in her train .
Well , I was persuaded there were two .
could not have supposed any thing !-- Such elegance and profusion !-- I have seen nothing like it since -- Well , where shall we sit ?
Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught .
do you recommend this side ?-- Well , I am sure , Mr . Churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .
What you direct in this house cannot be wrong .
I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I cannot help beginning ."
He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , " _She_ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be .-- To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet ."
" Indeed I will .
You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper ."
The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet ' s infatuation .-- From Harriet ' s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes .
She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite .-- Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr . Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her !
She did not regret it .
She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain .
The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews :-- in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .
" It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish ," she continued , " to have no reserves with you on this subject .
my sins , my sins !-- And I had plenty all the while in my pocket !-- One of my senseless tricks !-- I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life .-- Well --( sitting down again )-- go on -- what else ?"
And secretly she added to herself , " Lord bless me !
It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married .
She then took a longer time for consideration .
She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed .-- She was decided , and thus spoke --
" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning .
The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart ."
it was such an inexpressible obligation !-- The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time -- when I saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before .
In one moment such a change !
" It is very natural .
It is natural , and it is honourable .-- Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully .-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise .
I do not by any means engage for its being returned .
Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you .
But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr . Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax .
They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
As they were turning into the grounds , Mr . Perry passed by on horseback .
Mrs . Weston looked surprized , and said , " I did not know that he ever had any such plan ."
" Nay , I had it from you .
" Me !
You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon .
cried Mr . Weston , " about Perry and a carriage ?
I am glad he can afford it .
" It is odd though ," observed his father , " that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe .
And at others , what a heap of absurdities it is !
Emma , you are a great dreamer , I think ?"
Mrs . Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .
I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .
Where is she ?-- Oh !
The dream must be borne with , and Mr . Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized Pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded .
Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .
Where is it ?
I want to puzzle you again ."
Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves .
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the " poor little boys ," or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it .
She was sitting by Mr . Knightley , and turned to him for help .
The word was _blunder_ ; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on Jane ' s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible .
Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn .
These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick .
It was a child ' s play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill ' s part .
This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it .
Jane ' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived .
It was his duty .
Oh !
" Never , never !"
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come ?
This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr . Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs . Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs . Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .
Every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr . Weston ' s temper .
Come , and eat my strawberries .
I should like it of all things ," was not plainer in words than manner .
" Oh !
Married women , you know , may be safely authorised .
I will invite your guests ."
"-- Mrs . Weston , I suppose ," interrupted Mrs . Elton , rather mortified .
" Ah !
Don ' t scruple .
" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever ."
Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs . Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy .-- She had some fears of his horse .
Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs . Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of .-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question .
There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now she feared it not .
Mr . Knightley had done all in his power for Mr . Woodhouse ' s entertainment .
such an aunt !"
Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him .
" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still ," said Emma .
" As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again .
Some people were always cross when they were hot .
" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places .
" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us .
" But if I do , I shall be crosser still .
CHAPTER VII
Mrs . Weston remained with Mr . Woodhouse .
The Eltons walked together ; Mr . Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
They were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady , to Ireland by another .
I was fatigued .
I am perfectly comfortable to - day ."
Any nonsense will serve .
" It is a sort of thing ," cried Mrs . Elton emphatically , " which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into .
Better pass it off as a joke .
" Oh !
How will a conundrum reckon ?"
A conundrum of Mr . Weston ' s shall clear him and his next neighbour .
Come , sir , pray let me hear it ."
" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is .-- What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ?"
" Ah !
You , ( to Emma ), I am certain , will never guess .-- I will tell you .-- M .
Understanding and gratification came together .
" With all my heart .
Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen .
" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I cannot imagine them to be very frequent .
Find some body for me .
" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes .
Remember ."
He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ?
There she is -- no , that ' s somebody else .
Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again .
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ?
I dare say she did not understand me ."
" I assure you she did .
She felt your full meaning .
I wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity .
It was badly done , indeed !
They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern .
She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .
How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates !
How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell .
_There_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach .
Miss Bates should never again -- no , never !
" The ladies were all at home ."
Poor old Mrs . Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on .
Do you sit where you like ?
Emma seriously hoped she would .
The touch seemed immediate .
One cannot wonder , one cannot wonder .
It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune --( again dispersing her tears )-- but , poor dear soul !
When one is in great pain , you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve .
You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed -- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming .
` Well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .'
Emma was most sincerely interested .
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs . Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell ' s return ."
" So very kind !"
" Where -- may I ask ?-- is Miss Fairfax going ?"
It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane ' s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go .
Elton ?"
However , _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it ."
Mrs . Smallridge , a most delightful woman !-- A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere .
madam ," cried Emma , " if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned ."
" And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ?"
Mr . Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy ' s son wanted to speak with him .
There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma ' s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind .
What is to become of that ?-- Very true .
Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now .-- ` You must go ,' said she .
-- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter ' s ."
But is not this a sudden scheme ?"
Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself .
While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going -- her father began his inquiries .
Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs . and Miss Bates , Mr . Knightley , as I told you before .
He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr . Knightley ' s going to London had been an unexpected blow .
Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .
" Poor Mrs . Churchill !
She saw in a moment all the possible good .
Mr . Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew .
Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
A note was written to urge it .
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
Her spirits seemed overcome .
When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together -- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_ .
One morning , about ten days after Mrs . Churchill ' s decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr . Weston , who " could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her ."
I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
I should not have used the expression .
Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .
" Oh !
There is no use in delay .
Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,
Do not let mine continue longer .
" You are right .
" He has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand .
It is impossible to express our surprize .
" More than an attachment , indeed ," resumed Mrs . Weston ; " an engagement -- a positive engagement .-- What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged ;-- nay , that they have been long engaged !"
You do not mean it ?"
I can hardly believe it .-- I thought I knew him ."
" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself .
to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it .-- That is a degree of placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect ."
So unlike what a man should be !-- None of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life ."
It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
It may bring many extenuations .
While poor Mrs . Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required .
But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding .
What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !"
" I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard ."
" You are in luck .-- Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady ."
" True .
and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for Frank , I mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right .
cried Emma feelingly .
This was a device , I suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing .
CHAPTER XI
" Harriet , poor Harriet !"
-- Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her .
It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet ' s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence .-- Poor Harriet !
-- She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice .-- It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ' s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed .
An injunction of secresy had been among Mr . Weston ' s parting words .
Mr . Churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum ."
-- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
I met him just now .
-- said Emma , still perplexed .
You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly ."
I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
At first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words );-- I should not have dared to give way to -- I should not have thought it possible -- But if _you_ , who had been always acquainted with him --"
" Harriet !"
cried Emma , " this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake !-- What is to be done ?"
Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said ,
" Have you any idea of Mr . Knightley ' s returning your affection ?"
Circumstances that might swell to half an hour ' s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself .-- The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed !--( Harriet could not recall it without a blush .)
" Mr . Martin !
He was coming through the hall .
Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him .
When had his influence , such influence begun ?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied ?-- She looked back ; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter ' s becoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it -- oh !
This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection .
Knightley .-- Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet ' s ;-- and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly .
Was it new for one , perhaps too busy to seek , to be the prize of a girl who would seek him ?-- Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal , inconsistent , incongruous -- or for chance and circumstance ( as second causes ) to direct the human fate ?
Oh !
Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought !-- Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .
How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr .
Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr . Knightley , first in interest and affection .-- Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .
In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
_She_ could not .
She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr . Knightley .
Emma smiled , and felt that Mr . Weston had very good reason for saying so .
said Emma .
I never can be blameless .
" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ."
` I did not make the allowances ,' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first .'
Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible ."
She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause .
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax ' s peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .
The weather added what it could of gloom .
If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends , Hartfield must be comparatively deserted ; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness .
And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet ' s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet ' s society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma ' s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ?
In half a minute they were together .
The " How d ' ye do ' s " were quiet and constrained on each side .
Yet she could not bear this silence .
" Have I ?"
" How is it possible ?"
Her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , " The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel !"
cried he , looking eagerly at her , " are you , indeed ?"
" I have very little to say for my own conduct .-- I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased .-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding .
And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour .
She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr . Knightley startled her , by saying ,
" Oh !
Emma could not bear to give him pain .
said he .
Mr . Perry is not gone ."
I will tell you exactly what I think ."
" As a friend !"
-- repeated Mr .
Knightley .--" Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate ?-- I have gone too far already for concealment .-- Emma , I accept your offer -- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ?"
at present I ask no more ."
Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment .
" I cannot make speeches , Emma :" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing .--" If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more .
She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain .
He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it .
There was too much domestic happiness in his brother ' s house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer .-- He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning ' s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax .-- Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer .
Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
" I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed .
She frequently gave me hints of it .
While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either .
She must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her .-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend .
But she was always right .
I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you .
Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority .
Have patience with me , I shall soon have done .-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .
It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy .
with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done .-- I felt that it would be of a different sort .-- Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake ?-- No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her .
A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away .
Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before .
She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs . Weston foretold .
" I shall be very glad to look it over ," said he ; " but it seems long .
But that would not do .
We will not be severe ."
" Not at all .
Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal .-- No judge of his own manners by you .-- Always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience .-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret .
" I perfectly agree with you , sir ,"-- was then his remark .
"` Smallridge !'
I shall soon have done .
Part only of this answer , however , was admitted .
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
" Ah !
You must get his consent before you ask mine ."
This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield -- the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became .
The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from .
CHAPTER XVI
Mrs . John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr . Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care .-- When it was thus settled on her sister ' s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr . Woodhouse ' s carriage .-- It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .
" This is most kind , indeed !-- Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words ."
Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,
You see how delightfully she writes .
" For when a lady ' s in the case , " You know all other things give place ."
Now I say , my dear , in _our_ case , for _lady_ , read ---- mum !
And again , on Emma ' s merely turning her head to look at Mrs . Bates ' s knitting , she added , in a half whisper ,
It was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion .
Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing .
Miss Bates looked about her , so happily !--
" Oh !
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."
His civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing .
I assure you I am not at all pleased .
Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods .-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley !-- Can you explain it ?"
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself .
" Oh !
The smile was returned as Jane answered ,
" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh !
" That is ," replied Mr . Knightley , " she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .
" Poor child !"
I , who am owing all my happiness to _you_ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ?"
" Do you ?-- I have no doubt .
I do not believe I did you any good .
I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least ."
"` Mr .
I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what ."
I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again ."
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice .
he cried , " I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together .
He seems perfectly unprepared for that ."
Poor man !-- it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .
Knightley ?-- Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him ?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him ?-- Would not he like to have him always on the spot ?-- Yes .
Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event .-- She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield !
And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
Only let me be told when I may speak out .-- I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion ."
In general , it was a very well approved match .
poor fellow !-- sad business for him .-- She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities .-- How could he be so taken in ?-- Did not think him at all in love -- not in the least .-- Poor Knightley !-- There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him .-- How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him !
But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day .-- Shocking plan , living together .
" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news ."
said she , quickly , looking up in his face .
You are trying not to smile ."
He paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face .
" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is .
She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement .
But in time they will .
You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
" I mean that he has done it ," answered Mr . Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , " and been accepted ."
He stopped .-- Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply .
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
" I am quite sure ," he replied , speaking very distinctly , " that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so .
Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin ' s cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life .-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for ."
The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined .
She must laugh at such a close !
They arrived .-- Mrs .
" The shame ," he answered , " is all mine , or ought to be .
But is it possible that you had no suspicion ?-- I mean of late .
" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all .-- I am sure you had .-- I am sure it was a consolation to you ."
" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth .
" True , true ," he answered , warmly .
I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head .
I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come ."
If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr . Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty .
She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr . Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr .
She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness .
The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr .
Knightley .-- They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ' s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan .-- John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it .
The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr . Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence .
Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed .
Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer ' s hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary ' s birth -- " Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq .
-- Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father .
Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake .
Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother ' s rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily .
His two other children were of very inferior value .
Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne .
All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .
Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world .
Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away .
There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal .
The Kellynch property was good , but not equal to Sir Walter ' s apprehension of the state required in its possessor .
There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference .
Chapter 2
Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted .
She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding .
What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ?
Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell ' s too gentle reductions .
" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple ," he said , " in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side .
A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell ' s society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition .
Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to Sir Walter ' s feelings they must have been dreadful .
" I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter ," said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall , as he laid down the newspaper , " that the present juncture is much in our favour .
Many a noble fortune has been made during the war .
" He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd ," replied Sir Walter ; " that ' s all I have to remark .
You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected ."
" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant .
Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights .
" Very true , very true .
What Miss Anne says , is very true ," was Mr Shepherd ' s rejoinder , and " Oh !
A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line .
In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young ."
By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make , Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing --( it was just as he had foretold , Mr Shepherd observed , Sir Walter ' s concerns could not be kept a secret ,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let , and understanding his ( Mr Shepherd ' s ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given Mr Shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant .
" He is a rear admiral of the white .
Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral ' s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .
He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for .
" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be ," continued he ; " asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford .
how very odd !
" I have let my house to Admiral Croft ," would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere Mr --; a Mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation ,) always needs a note of explanation .
Chapter 4
Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of !
He was brilliant , he was headstrong .
Lady Russell had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror .
She deprecated the connexion in every light .
Young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father ' s ill - will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but Lady Russell , whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain .
But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it .
A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended Anne ' s share of suffering from it .
She did not blame Lady Russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good .
She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on .
He had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place .
How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been !
She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning .
Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the Admiral ' s side , as could not but influence Sir Walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd ' s assurances of his being known , by report , to the Admiral , as a model of good breeding .
It would be most right , and most wise , and , therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others .
So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay ' s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her .
Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell .
But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety .
Lady Russell felt this break - up of the family exceedingly .
Their respectability was as dear to her as her own , and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit .
Here Anne had often been staying .
While well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely .
I began to think I should never see you .
So , Lady Russell would not get out .
" Oh !
I have not seen him since seven o ' clock .
He would go , though I told him how ill I was .
" I can give you no account of them .
It is early ."
" I never want them , I assure you .
I went .
So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it ."
She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time .
or in the anxious supplement from Mary , of -- " Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath !"
The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music .
She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion .
Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits .
As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .
" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary ' s interference ," was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary ' s reproach of " Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order ," she never had the smallest temptation to say , " Very true ."
But to be sure , in general they are so spoilt !
Bless me !
She had this communication , moreover , from Mary .
" Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but I am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house - maid and laundry - maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long .
I meet them wherever I go ; and I declare , I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them .
If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them ."
Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it .
The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company .
Lord bless me !
How low it makes me !"
When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ?
She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re - perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death .
To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton -- a very fine young man -- but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to Anne ' s nerves .
And not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the Musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor Dick ' s having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as " a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster ," were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival .
It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine ; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm , and Charles Musgrove began , consequently , to feel no necessity for longer confinement .
" Nothing can be going on better than the child ," said he ; " so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right .
Mary knew , from Charles ' s manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him .
" So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening !
I knew how it would be .
If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and Charles is as bad as any of them .
Very unfeeling !
You will not be hysterical again .
I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us .
I have not nerves for the sort of thing ."
I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is .
Leave little Charles to my care .
You can send for us , you know , at a moment ' s notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you .
I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child ."
" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are .
Anne will stay ; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him .
Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting .
Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance , and their visit in general .
He had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet .
Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could .
it is over !"
Events of every description , changes , alienations , removals -- all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past -- how natural , how certain too !
Alas !
Doubtless it was so , and she could take no revenge , for he was not altered , or not for the worse .
No : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages .
Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them .
He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt .
It had been the effect of over - persuasion .
He had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again .
He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves , if they could catch it ; a heart , in short , for any pleasing young woman who came in his way , excepting Anne Elliot .
" Yes , here I am , Sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match .
" A strong mind , with sweetness of manner ," made the first and the last of the description .
If I am a fool , I shall be a fool indeed , for I have thought on the subject more than most men ."
From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove ' s who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying --
Quite worn out and broken up .
Reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so I was sent off to the West Indies ."
The girls looked all amazement .
" Phoo !
phoo !"
" To be sure you did .
I knew she would .
Anne ' s shudderings were to herself alone ; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror .
I always forgot ."
" Oh !
How fast I made money in her .
A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands .
Excellent fellow .
Her feelings made her speak low ; and Captain Wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more .
continued Mrs Musgrove ; " he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care !
Ah !
Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne ' s slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for .
He defended himself ; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his , excepting for a ball , or a visit , which a few hours might comprehend .
-- All idle refinement !
I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall ," ( with a kind bow to Anne ), " beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether ."
" You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board ."
Where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ?"
" My dear Frederick , you are talking quite idly .
" But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures .
We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days ."
" What a great traveller you must have been , ma ' am !"
While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared .
A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards .
I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience ."
I am quite of your opinion .
If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ?
She had rather play .
Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches .
It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day .
Charles " had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war .
" Now you are taking nonsense , Mary ," was therefore his answer .
The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near Taunton , which is some of the best land in the country .
I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me ."
She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening .
She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .
It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise .
Is he coming , Louisa ?"
One morning , very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves , at which Anne had not been present , Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing - room at the Cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid Charles , who was lying on the sofa .
Will you not sit down ?
Do not you hear your aunt speak ?
But not a bit did Walter stir .
She could not even thank him .
It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth .
After a short struggle , however , Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field .
When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ?"
Their time and strength , and spirits , were , therefore , exactly ready for this walk , and they entered into it with pleasure .
This distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of Louisa ' s which struck her .
You make the most of it , I know ," cried Louisa , " but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place .
And there was silence between them for a little while .
Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired ."
But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life ."
They were speaking as they drew near .
What Anne first heard was --
I am almost ashamed to say it ."
After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on .
I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this .
Here is a nut ," said he , catching one down from an upper bough .
It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth !
For herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen .
Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again .
" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects ," said she ; " but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride .
" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary .
The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more .
The listener ' s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers ; she had heard no evil of herself , but she had heard a great deal of very painful import .
She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth , and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation .
She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles ' s other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife .
He could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling .
They had travelled half their way along the rough lane , before she was quite awake to what they said .
Ay , this comes of the peace .
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch .
Then there would always be company for them .
One could not be connected with better people .
It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth , within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families .
The conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined .
The rooms were shut up , the lodgers almost all gone , scarcely any family but of the residents left ; and , as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves , the remarkable situation of the town , the principal street almost hurrying into the water , the walk to the Cobb , skirting round the pleasant little bay , which , in the season , is animated with bathing machines and company ; the Cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements , with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town , are what the stranger ' s eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be , who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme , to make him wish to know it better .
The scenes in its neighbourhood , Charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme ; and , above all , Pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far - famed Isle of Wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of Lyme understood .
Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the Cobb .
Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies .
Fortune came , his prize - money as lieutenant being great ; promotion , too , came at last ; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it .
Captain Harville was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than Captain Wentworth .
He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation .
Mrs Harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of Captain Wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them .
On quitting the Cobb , they all went in - doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many .
The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited , were more than amusing to Anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .
They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being " so entirely out of season ," and the " no thoroughfare of Lyme ," and the " no expectation of company ," had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn .
The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers .
For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly .
They praised the morning ; gloried in the sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh - feeling breeze -- and were silent ; till Henrietta suddenly began again with --
There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve - month .
Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ?
Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ?
She was looking remarkably well ; her very regular , very pretty features , having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion , and by the animation of eye which it had also produced .
Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it .
He seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person .
" Pray ," said Captain Wentworth , immediately , " can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ?"
cried Mary ; " it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed !
But , Anne , only conceive how extraordinary !
I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me !
The horror of the moment to all who stood around !
Leave me , and go to him .
He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only -- " True , true , a surgeon this instant ," was darting away , when Anne eagerly suggested --
" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ?
Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth .
Both seemed to look to her for directions .
Captain Wentworth ' s eyes were also turned towards her .
" Had not she better be carried to the inn ?
Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn ."
They were not off the Cobb , before the Harvilles met them .
Louisa had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness .
Captain Benwick must give up his room to them , and get another bed elsewhere ; and the whole was settled .
Musgrove , either you or I must go ."
But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one .
The other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared .
" It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do .
One thing more , and all seemed arranged .
And to go home without Charles , too , without her husband !
And in short , she said more than her husband could long withstand , and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way , there was no help for it ; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable .
She endeavoured to be composed , and to be just .
Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry , she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend .
He was devoted to Henrietta ; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits .
that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment !
But so eager and so resolute !
Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits .
They got on fast .
In a low , cautious voice , he said : --
She must not appear at first .
But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen .
No symptoms worse than before had appeared .
When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good .
He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do ."
Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent .
They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence .
There could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery .
An hour ' s complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell ' s carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart .
Lady Russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove .
The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa .
At the end of that period , Lady Russell ' s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , " I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon .
Anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing --
By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it ."
Strangers filling their place !"
As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove ' s recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !
" We have made very few changes either ," continued the Admiral , after thinking a moment .
" Very few .
We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross .
That has been a very great improvement .
You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had .
Such a number of looking - glasses !
Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say --
The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter .
Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath .
She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight .
Charles laughed .
But Mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot , or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed .
She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries .
His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh !
" And I am sure ," cried Mary , warmly , " it was a very little to his credit , if he did .
I am sure you will agree with me ."
" Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick ."
" I think Lady Russell would like him .
exclaimed Mary , tauntingly .
" He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop ' s one ' s scissors , or anything that happens .
Lady Russell could not help laughing .
Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once , when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again .
Anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which Louisa ' s illness must have so greatly shaken .
Louisa was now recovering apace .
Captain Wentworth was gone , for the present , to see his brother in Shropshire .
Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath .
Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for .
They were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes .
They had no inclination to listen to her .
Everybody was wanting to visit them .
Here were funds of enjoyment .
A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ?
Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot ' s frequent visits were talked of .
They could not listen to her description of him .
They were describing him themselves ; Sir Walter especially .
and there was a Mrs Wallis , at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as " a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in Camden Place ," and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted .
they were infinitely worse .
" The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day ."
Could it be Mr Elliot ?
They could think of no one else .
If he had but asked who the party were !
" The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty ," said he , " as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing , are more absurd , I believe , than those of any other set of beings in the world .
His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place .
She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .
Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well !
In the course of the same morning , Anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her " less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher .
" Ha !
Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her .
Lady Russell ' s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in Camden Place .
Colonel Wallis said it , and Lady Russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice .
Anne presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention " Elizabeth ."
Lady Russell listened , and looked , and made only this cautious reply :--" Elizabeth !
She knew it well ; and she remembered another person ' s look also .
" You are mistaken ," said he gently , " that is not good company ; that is the best .
She is fastidious .
" Yes ," sighed Anne , " we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them !"
In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance ."
" Well ," said Anne , " I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place ."
You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different .
Her husband had been extravagant ; and at his death , about two years before , had left his affairs dreadfully involved .
Twelve years were gone since they had parted , and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined .
She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again , no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs , no health to make all the rest supportable .
How could it be ?
Then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense .
She had seen too much of the world , to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere , but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve , and would not use her ill ; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse , as a sister of her landlady , a nurse by profession , and who had always a home in that house when unemployed , chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her .
" And she ," said Mrs Smith , " besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance .
What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self - denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most .
A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes ."
I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however .
A Mrs Smith .
What is her age ?
She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship ' s service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her .
Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , " I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother ' s place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me .
The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again .
She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ?
How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ?
It was the beginning of February ; and Anne , having been a month in Bath , was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme .
She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated .
cried Sir Walter .
" The Crofts have arrived in Bath ?
" A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir ."
I know what is due to my tenant ."
We have had a very dull Christmas ; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays .
I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January , except Charles Hayter , who had been calling much oftener than was welcome .
The carriage is gone to - day , to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to - morrow .
What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth !
But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited .
" Mary M ---.
" I am sorry to say that I am very far from well ; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore - throat very much about .
But now for Louisa .
True , upon my honour !
Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her .
She had never in her life been more astonished .
It was almost too wonderful for belief , and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room , preserve an air of calmness , and answer the common questions of the moment .
If we were not related , it would not signify ; but as cousins , she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours .
She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly .
The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other .
They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta ' s coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable .
She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed .
No , it was not regret which made Anne ' s heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free .
She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them .
They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together .
Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her .
" Ha !
I can never get by this shop without stopping .
taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion .
But here comes a friend , Captain Brigden ; I shall only say , ` How d ' ye do ?'
Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife .
When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate .
That young lady , you know , that we have all been so concerned for .
He was courting her week after week .
" Well , she is to marry him .
" I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man ," said Anne , " and I understand that he bears an excellent character ."
He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of .
" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick ' s manners better than his .
" And the thing is certainly true .
It is not a mere bit of gossip .
" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that .
Before Mrs Croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time Anne walked out , she saw him .
He soon joined them again , successful , of course ; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes .
Her ladyship ' s carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort .
Miss Carteret was with her mother ; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies .
There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot .
Whoever suffered inconvenience , she must suffer none , but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two .
He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before ; he looked quite red .
Still , however , she had enough to feel !
It was agitation , pain , pleasure , a something between delight and misery .
He spoke to her , and then turned away .
She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , " I am only waiting for Mr Elliot .
There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend .
being all that she had time for , as she passed away .
As soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of Captain Wentworth ' s party began talking of them .
He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe .
" She is pretty , I think ; Anne Elliot ; very pretty , when one comes to look at her .
It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister ."
" And so do I .
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet .
But it was more probable that he should be come to stay .
There were many other men about him , many groups walking the same way , but there was no mistaking him .
They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description ."
She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow .
Sir Walter , his two daughters , and Mrs Clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room .
Anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke .
brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground .
She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on Captain Wentworth ' s making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself .
The Musgroves are behaving like themselves , most honourably and kindly , only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter ' s comfort .
A sudden recollection seemed to occur , and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne ' s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground .
After clearing his throat , however , he proceeded thus --
" I confess that I do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind .
He ought not ; he does not ."
It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say --
I could not leave it till Louisa ' s doing well was quite ascertained .
She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak .
I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short " ( with a faint blush at some recollections ), " altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable ."
She was in good humour with all .
Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in .
He must love her .
Anne ' s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening ; it was just occupation enough : she had feelings for the tender , spirits for the gay , attention for the scientific , and patience for the wearisome ; and had never liked a concert better , at least during the first act .
Towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an Italian song , she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot .
this is too much flattery .
Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me ."
Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth ' s brother .
He might have been in Mr Elliot ' s company , but she had not courage to ask the question .
" A well - looking man ," said Sir Walter , " a very well - looking man ."
" A very fine young man indeed !"
" More air than one often sees in Bath .
His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch ."
When she could give another glance , he had moved away .
Mr Elliot ' s speech , too , distressed her .
She was persuaded by Lady Russell ' s countenance that she had seen him .
Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came .
In re - settling themselves there were now many changes , the result of which was favourable for her .
Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight .
" Is not this song worth staying for ?"
said Anne , suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging .
he replied impressively , " there is nothing worth my staying for ;" and he was gone directly .
Jealousy of Mr Elliot !
But , alas !
Their evil was incalculable .
In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion .
Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith .
It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect .
You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond ."
" But I ought to have looked about me more ," said Anne , conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about , that the object only had been deficient .
I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to .
It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time ."
" Pray ," said Mrs Smith , " is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ?
repeated Anne , looking up surprised .
" I have been a good deal acquainted with him ," replied Mrs Smith , gravely , " but it seems worn out now .
" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you ," replied Anne ; " but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case .
" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon .
" Now , how I do wish I understood you !
It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers .
Let me plead for my -- present friend I cannot call him , but for my former friend .
" My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot ' s wife has not been dead much above half a year .
Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy .
I assure you I shall not .
Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot ' s failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else .
" It first came into my head ," replied Mrs Smith , " upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way .
She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot .
Even the smooth surface of family - union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath .
Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced .
Oh !
I will not abuse him .
" I know it all , I know it all ," cried Mrs Smith .
I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go .
I have always understood they were not a happy couple .
He told me the whole story .
He had no concealments with me .
" This explains it .
How sure to be mistaken !
Mrs Smith hesitated a little here .
" But was not she a very low woman ?"
The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine .
Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said --
Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning .
I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now .
She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me .
On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings .
This will not do .
Mr Elliot ' s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father .
" I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but --"
So says my historian , at least .
Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to .
But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence .
" I am very glad to know all this ," said Anne , after a little thoughtfulness .
Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance .
But there was nobody to stir in it .
Mr Elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money .
There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him .
She must talk to Lady Russell , tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell ; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself .
She found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing Mr Elliot ; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening .
She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything .
His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments .
You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night .
Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card .
While her father spoke , there was a knock at the door .
After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and " Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove " were ushered into the room .
Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but Anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well .
So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles ' s brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .
She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove , Henrietta , and Captain Harville , beside their two selves .
Mrs Harville , her children , and Captain Benwick , remained with Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross .
Mary does not above half like Henrietta ' s match .
It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now ."
He answered rather hesitatingly , " Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different .
I have a great value for Benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say .
They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each .
We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment ' s inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness ."
Come , and tell me .
I recollect .
" No ," cried Anne , quickly , " it cannot be Mr Elliot , I assure you .
Not know Mr Elliot , indeed !
The visitors took their leave ; and Charles , having civilly seen them off , and then made a face at them , and abused them for coming , began with --
Take a box for to - morrow night !
" Phoo !
Never worth remembering .
" No , I did not promise .
I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ` happy .'
There was no promise ."
There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves .
If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir .
What is Mr Elliot to me ?"
Mrs Musgrove interposed .
" If it depended only on my inclination , ma ' am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary ' s account ) would not be the smallest impediment .
" Oh !
I am no card - player ."
You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes ."
They were obliged to move .
The sequel explained it .
He held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it .
" Only think of Elizabeth ' s including everybody !"
He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return .
When she reached the White Hart , and made her way to the proper apartment , she found herself neither arriving quite in time , nor the first to arrive .
" That is precisely what I was going to observe ," cried Mrs Croft .
Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .
He looked at her with a smile , and a little motion of the head , which expressed , " Come to me , I have something to say ;" and the unaffected , easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was , strongly enforced the invitation .
" Certainly : Captain Benwick ."
This was drawn at the Cape .
But who else was there to employ ?
" No ," replied Anne , in a low , feeling voice .
You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship .
" Have you finished your letter ?"
I am only ready whenever you are .
Well , Miss Elliot ," ( lowering his voice ,) " as I was saying we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point .
Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands .
We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point .
And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth ' s absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ` They cannot be here till such a day ,' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still !
If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence !
All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ), is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone ."
Their attention was called towards the others .
" I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend .
" Yes ," said he , " very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute .
I know you will not be sorry to be off .
While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick , he had been also addressing her !
On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her .
" I can listen no longer in silence .
You pierce my soul .
I am half agony , half hope .
Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever .
I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me .
She began not to understand a word they said , and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself .
The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night .
" Oh !
" Do you think so ?
You will see them both this morning , I dare say .
Do promise me ."
Another momentary vexation occurred .
" Captain Wentworth , which way are you going ?
Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give Anne your arm to her father ' s door .
She had not mistaken him .
There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind .
There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way .
I could have no other pleasure .
But to be waiting so long in inaction , and waiting only for evil , had been dreadful .
In marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated ."
I could not bring it into play ; it was overwhelmed , buried , lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year .
" I should have thought ," said Anne , " that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this ."
" No , no !
It was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but Anne had never found an evening shorter .
My own self .
he cried , " you would !
It is a sort of pain , too , which is new to me .
Like other great men under reverses ," he added , with a smile .
Who can be in doubt of what followed ?
He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish , spendthrift baronet , who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him , and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter .
Mrs Clay ' s affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man ' s sake , the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter .
They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .
The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment ' s regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity .
[ Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811 ]
The late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister .
His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr . John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them .
He was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties .
Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs . Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence .
Elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself .
As such , however , they were treated by her with quiet civility ; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself , his wife , and their child .
Mrs . John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters .
To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree .
" Why , to be sure ," said her husband , very gravely , " that would make great difference .
" I would not wish to do any thing mean ," he replied .
" That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind I mean .-- My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself .
my dear Fanny ; her life cannot be worth half that purchase ."
Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing .
Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother ' s disposal , without any restriction whatever .
" I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year .
Do but consider , my dear Mr . Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it .
Five hundred a year !
Mrs . Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible .
But Mrs . Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration .
She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it .
" Like him !"
But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister ' s choice ?"
It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter .
To satisfy me , those characters must be united .
mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward ' s manner in reading to us last night !
I could hardly keep my seat .
I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper ."
Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him .
" What a pity it is , Elinor ," said Marianne , " that Edward should have no taste for drawing ."
" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now .
Ashamed of being otherwise .
Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment ."
What his mother really is we cannot know ; but , from Fanny ' s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank ."
A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection .
She gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations .
The situation of Barton , in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire , which , but a few hours before , would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place , was now its first recommendation .
The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence .
So far from hence !
And to what part of it ?"
A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them ."
Mrs . Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession .
Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure .
Now was the time when her son - in - law ' s promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled .
Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment .
With the size and furniture of the house Mrs . Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments .
Conversation however was not wanted , for Sir John was very chatty , and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home .
They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood .
Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife .
Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties .
He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen .
The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton .
Luckily Lady Middleton ' s mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine .
Marianne was vexed at it for her sister ' s sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs . Jennings ' s .
He was silent and grave .
His appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike .
The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother ' s account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it .
Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one ' s attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished .
Colonel Brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures .
He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste .
She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood .
She rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again .
Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs . Jennings , but he is old enough to be MY father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind .
" Infirmity !"
" My dearest child ," said her mother , laughing , " at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty ."
But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon ' s being thirty - five any objection to his marrying HER ."
In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing .
I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well .
Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay .
what can be the meaning of it !
In Edward ' s farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both .
Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room .
And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did .
But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise .
Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting .
" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you .
cried Marianne , indignantly .
Sir John was rather puzzled .
But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr . Willoughby ' s pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind .
Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care ."
" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived ," repeated Sir John .
" Did he indeed ?"
cried Marianne with sparkling eyes , " and with elegance , with spirit ?"
Poor Brandon !
Marianne ' s preserver , as Margaret , with more elegance than precision , styled Willoughby , called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries .
He was received by Mrs . Dashwood with more than politeness ; with a kindness which Sir John ' s account of him and her own gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him .
From Willoughby their expression was at first held back , by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created .
It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk .
But I see what you mean .
He came to them every day .
Willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively spirits , and open , affectionate manners .
His manners , though serious , were mild ; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper .
Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion .
" Brandon is just the kind of man ," said Willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , " whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to ."
I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature ."
" Miss Dashwood ," cried Willoughby , " you are now using me unkindly .
You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will .
Little had Mrs . Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment .
In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection .
Willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions .
When he was present she had no eyes for any one else .
Every thing he said , was clever .
Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys .
" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne ' s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for .
" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ?
or is it equally criminal in every body ?
I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment ' s being pardonable ."
The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips .
As it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard .
The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love .
CHAPTER 12
I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby .
Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book ."
pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it ," said Mrs . Jennings .
" No , THAT he is not .
Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing , at this moment , " that it rained very hard ," though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship ' s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother .
But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her .
Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected .
Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon ;-- he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room .
" What is the matter with Brandon ?"
It came from town , and is merely a letter of business ."
" No , indeed , it is not ."
" Oh !
He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it .
" Oh !
Colonel Brandon ' s horses were announced .
" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ?"
" Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ?"
" I am afraid , none at all ."
To Marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing .
" Come Colonel ," said Mrs . Jennings , " before you go , do let us know what you are going about ."
asked Marianne .
Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods .
Mrs . Jennings sat on Elinor ' s right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , " I have found you out in spite of all your tricks .
I know where you spent the morning ."
--
" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs . Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr .
Poor man !
It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time .
May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over .
She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power ; for though Willoughby was independent , there was no reason to believe him rich .
THAT I will never consent to .
" I am heartily glad of it ," he cried .
" Thank you , Willoughby .
But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world .
" I am ," said he .
Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage ."
" With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose ," said Elinor .
I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it .
How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs . Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for .
Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me ."
The promise was readily given , and Willoughby ' s behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness .
said Mrs . Dashwood , when he was leaving them .
On their return from the park they found Willoughby ' s curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs . Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just .
He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over - powered Marianne .
cried Mrs . Dashwood as she entered --" is she ill ?"
" Disappointment ?"
My visits to Mrs . Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth ."
For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ?"
His colour increased ; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied , " You are too good ."
Mrs . Dashwood was too much astonished to speak , and another pause succeeded .
This was broken by Willoughby , who said with a faint smile , " It is folly to linger in this manner .
She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust .
And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ?
He had not the power of accepting it .
I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you ."
Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings !
You had rather take evil upon credit than good .
And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ?
my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ?
It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect .
Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected .
Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ?
They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret ; and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother , to acknowledge the probability of many , and hope for the justice of all .
They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time , when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word .
She was without any power , because she was without any desire of command over herself .
No letter from Willoughby came ; and none seemed expected by Marianne .
Her mother was surprised , and Elinor again became uneasy .
Elinor could not deny the truth of this , and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence .
She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially ."
" I would not ask such a question for the world .
Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles .
To Marianne , indeed , the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour .
She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward ; and it ended , as every feeling must end with her , by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby , whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect .
" A fortnight !"
she repeated , surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before .
He looked rather distressed as he added , that he had been staying with some friends near Plymouth .
" Have you been lately in Sussex ?"
What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired !
" No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood .
" Because ," replied he , smiling , " among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane ."
Are the Middletons pleasant people ?"
" No ," said Marianne , in a low voice , " nor how many painful moments ."
Mrs . Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural .
Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder .
He was not in spirits , however ; he praised their house , admired its prospect , was attentive , and kind ; but still he was not in spirits .
The whole family perceived it , and Mrs . Dashwood , attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother , sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents .
" What are Mrs . Ferrars ' s views for you at present , Edward ?"
I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall .
I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence ."
cried Marianne .
" Grandeur has but little ," said Elinor , " but wealth has much to do with it ."
Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned ."
" Perhaps ," said Elinor , smiling , " we may come to the same point .
Come , what is your competence ?"
repeated Edward --" but why must you have hunters ?
" Oh that they would !"
Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point .
replied he , with a sigh .
" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne ' s ," said Elinor ; " I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry ."
" But I thought it was right , Elinor ," said Marianne , " to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people .
This has always been your doctrine , I am sure ."
" Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other .
Edward started --" Reserved !
Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ?"
But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open , and , turning round , was astonished to see Edward himself come out .
I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there .
" I suspect ," said Elinor , " that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another .
I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles .
I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower -- and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world ."
Elinor only laughed .
Before the middle of the day , they were visited by Sir John and Mrs . Jennings , who , having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage , came to take a survey of the guest .
With the assistance of his mother - in - law , Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of Ferrars began with an F . and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted Elinor , which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung .
Edward remained a week at the cottage ; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs . Dashwood to stay longer ; but , as if he were bent only on self - mortification , he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height .
He had no pleasure at Norland ; he detested being in town ; but either to Norland or London , he must go .
I always preferred the church , as I still do .
They recommended the army .
I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since ."
" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be ," said Mrs . Dashwood , " since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella ' s ."
" They will be brought up ," said he , in a serious accent , " to be as unlike myself as is possible .
You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy .
" I think ," replied Edward , " that I may defy many months to produce any good to me ."
She was sitting near the window , and as soon as Sir John perceived her , he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door , and stepping across the turf , obliged her to open the casement to speak to him , though the space was so short between the door and the window , as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other .
" Hush !
" Where is Marianne ?
She came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away .
How I should like such a house for myself !
Should not you , Mr .
Mrs . Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told .
" She expects to be confined in February ," continued Mrs . Jennings .
Do but look , mama , how sweet !
He then made his bow , and departed with the rest .
" Why should they ask us ?"
CHAPTER 20
As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing - room of the park the next day , at one door , Mrs . Palmer came running in at the other , looking as good humoured and merry as before .
She took them all most affectionately by the hand , and expressed great delight in seeing them again .
said she , seating herself between Elinor and Marianne , " for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow .
I am so sorry we cannot stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope ."
" Oh , my love ," cried Mrs . Palmer to her husband , who just then entered the room --" you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter ."
" I am afraid , Miss Marianne ," said Sir John , " you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today ."
" You and I , Sir John ," said Mrs . Jennings , " should not stand upon such ceremony ."
" Ay , you may abuse me as you please ," said the good - natured old lady , " you have taken Charlotte off my hands , and cannot give her back again .
The studied indifference , insolence , and discontent of her husband gave her no pain ; and when he scolded or abused her , she was highly diverted .
The motive was too common to be wondered at ; but the means , however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill - breeding , were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife .
You cannot think how happy I shall be !
The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful .
Palmer ?"
She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county , Mrs . Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby ' s general character , than could be gathered from the Middletons ' partial acquaintance with him ; and she was eager to gain from any one , such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne .
" You surprise me very much .
It will be quite delightful , I declare !
When is it to take place ?"
" Mr . Brandon was very well I hope ?"
It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage !
Nothing can be like it , to be sure !
But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately ."
Mr . Palmer is the kind of man I like ."
They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children .
She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted .
" Yet I hardly know how ," cried Marianne , " unless it had been under totally different circumstances .
Here too , Miss Dashwood ' s commendation , being only simple and just , came in without any eclat .
A short pause succeeded this speech , which was first broken by Miss Steele , who seemed very much disposed for conversation , and who now said rather abruptly , " And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ?
I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex ."
But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise , for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name , as Miss Steele had in hearing it .
" His name is Ferrars ," said he , in a very audible whisper ; " but pray do not tell it , for it ' s a great secret ."
What !
cried Lucy , who generally made an amendment to all her sister ' s assertions .
" And who was this uncle ?
How came they acquainted ?"
Elinor DID think the question a very odd one , and her countenance expressed it , as she answered that she had never seen Mrs . Ferrars .
" Indeed !"
I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours .
I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs .
" I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it .
Mrs . Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present -- but the time MAY come -- how soon it will come must depend upon herself -- when we may be very intimately connected ."
She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon .
Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs . Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained .
-- She paused .
" Four years !"
" Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date .
" Yes ; Mr . Pratt .
We cannot mean the same Mr .
Poor Edward !
" I certainly did not seek your confidence ," said Elinor ; " but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on .
I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance .
" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us .
I heard from him just before I left Exeter ;" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor .
Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her ?
He certainly loved her .
Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well - informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate , artful , and selfish ?
These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief !
Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters .
On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support .
From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise .
I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper ."
" You are very good , I hope it won ' t hurt your eyes -- will you ring the bell for some working candles ?
No one made any objection but Marianne , who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility , exclaimed , " Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME -- you know I detest cards .
The pianoforte at which Marianne , wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts , had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself , was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely , under the shelter of its noise , introduce the interesting subject , without any risk of being heard at the card - table .
With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward ' s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know ."
If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed ."
" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason ."
" A great coxcomb !"
repeated Miss Steele , whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne ' s music .-- " Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say ."
" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood ' s is not ," said Mrs . Jennings , laughing heartily ; " for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes ."
Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone , though Marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto --
" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned .
" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement .
You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes ."
Another pause therefore of many minutes ' duration , succeeded this speech , and Lucy was still the first to end it .
" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ?"
He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it ."
Since the death of her husband , who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town , she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square .
Towards this home , she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts , and thither she one day abruptly , and very unexpectedly by them , asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her .
I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it ."
" I have a notion ," said Sir John , " that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it .
" Nay ," cried Mrs . Jennings , " I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne ' s company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back .
Lord bless me !
You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again !
You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt .
And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other ."
After very little farther discourse , it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted .
Her mother ' s affliction was hardly less , and Elinor was the only one of the three , who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal .
It had formerly been Charlotte ' s , and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance , in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect .
" I am NOT going to write to my mother ," replied Marianne , hastily , and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry .
Elinor said no more ; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby ; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was , that , however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair , they must be engaged .
Her spirits still continued very high ; but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister , and this agitation increased as the evening drew on .
Every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , " Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is !"
Elinor was disappointed too ; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her ; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him .
" Is your sister ill ?"
He heard her with the most earnest attention , but seeming to recollect himself , said no more on the subject , and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London , making the usual inquiries about their journey , and the friends they had left behind .
Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last .
This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs . Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt .
But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ?"
I do not know what you and Mr . Willoughby will do between you about her .
However , I got a very good husband , and I don ' t know what the greatest beauty can do more .
He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries , but without satisfying her in any .
She was answered in the negative .
She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read ; but the book was soon thrown aside , and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room , pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window , in hopes of distinguishing the long - expected rap .
CHAPTER 27
" If this open weather holds much longer ," said Mrs . Jennings , when they met at breakfast the following morning , " Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day ' s pleasure .
" That is true ," cried Marianne , in a cheerful voice , and walking to the window as she spoke , to examine the day .
" It is charming weather for THEM indeed ," she continued , as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance .
But " ( with a little return of anxiety ) " it cannot be expected to last long .
The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs . Jennings ' s style of living , and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves , which was invariably kind .
Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton ' s regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions .
She feared it was a strengthening regard .
" Good God !"
From this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing .
Elinor ' s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment ' s glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there .
Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne .
This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve .
After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr . Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come .
" It cannot be generally known ," returned Elinor , " for her own family do not know it ."
I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question .
Is every thing finally settled ?
But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding .
I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence .
Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon ' s unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .
She sat by the drawing - room fire after tea , till the moment of Lady Middleton ' s arrival , without once stirring from her seat , or altering her attitude , lost in her own thoughts , and insensible of her sister ' s presence ; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door , she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected .
Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne , to see whether it could be unobserved by her .
This however was more than she could believe herself ; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne , it was beyond her wish .
Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address , and was unable to say a word .
He could not then avoid it , but her touch seemed painful to him , and he held her hand only for a moment .
My card was not lost , I hope ."
" Here is some mistake I am sure -- some dreadful mistake .
" Go to him , Elinor ," she cried , as soon as she could speak , " and force him to come to me .
" How can that be done ?
She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer .
Absence might have weakened his regard , and convenience might have determined him to overcome it , but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt .
Her own situation gained in the comparison ; for while she could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever , however they might be divided in future , her mind might be always supported .
It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby .
That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking .
" Indeed , Ma ' am ," said Elinor , very seriously , " you are mistaken .
" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments .
I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional .
With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood , may be imagined .
In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs . Jennings ' s chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one .
Mrs . Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ; for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness .
" Poor Elinor !
" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him .
Her second note , which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons ', was in these words :--
The morning that we parted too !
This woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me .
It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence ."
" Elinor , I must go home .
" It would be impossible to go to - morrow .
she looks very bad .-- No wonder .
The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her ."
As soon , however , as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on Marianne , she could stay no longer .
cried Mrs . Jennings , as soon as she was gone , " how it grieves me to see her !
nothing seems to do her any good .
Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill !
" Fifty thousand pounds , my dear .
Why don ' t he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ?
Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ?
She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ?"
" Aye , I believe that will be best for her .
Lord !
Lord !
No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will .
No positive engagement indeed !
After a short silence on both sides , Mrs . Jennings , with all her natural hilarity , burst forth again .
It will be all to one a better match for your sister .
Lord !
Oh !
Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can .
If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head !"
My poor husband !
He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear ."
" What did you hear ?"
" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think -- in short , that a man , whom I KNEW to be engaged -- but how shall I tell you ?
I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short .
Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her .
" Ah !"
said Colonel Brandon , " there is , indeed !
" Who can this be ?"
" He will not come in , as Mrs . Jennings is from home ."
" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others ."
A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it SHALL be a short one .
" You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation -- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you )-- a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne ."
Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends .
At seventeen she was lost to me for ever .
We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland .
My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy .
Ah !
I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her .
He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter ' s being entirely unconcerned in the business .
What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too ."
cried Elinor , " could it be -- could Willoughby !"
" The first news that reached me of her ," he continued , " came in a letter from herself , last October .
He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address !
When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known .
But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her .
Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment .
You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others ."
" Such ," said Colonel Brandon , after a pause , " has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter !
" No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains ."
Her mind did become settled , but it was settled in a gloomy dejection .
She recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs . Jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks .
She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother .
Sir John , could not have thought it possible .
Such a good - natured fellow !
It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly ' s puppies !
" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all .
She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was ."
She could soon tell at what coachmaker ' s the new carriage was building , by what painter Mr . Willoughby ' s portrait was drawn , and at what warehouse Miss Grey ' s clothes might be seen .
Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day , or twice , if the subject occurred very often , by saying , " It is very shocking , indeed !"
The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs . Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs . Ferrars .
" But I always thought I SHOULD .
And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone .
I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD ."
' Lord !
" I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town ," said Lucy , returning , after a cessation of hostile hints , to the charge .
Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition .
" What a charming thing it is that Mrs . Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together !"
" Oh , if that ' s all ," cried Miss Steele , " we can just as well go and see HER ."
Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick - cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in Mr . Gray ' s shop , as in her own bedroom .
Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days .
I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal .
And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM .
Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing .
As soon as they were out of the house , his enquiries began .
" Is Mr . Edward Ferrars ," said Elinor , with resolution , " going to be married ?"
A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs . Ferrars has a noble spirit .
To give you another instance of her liberality :-- The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny ' s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds .
" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one ."
And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live .
Elinor could only smile .
Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c . to supply the place of what was taken away .
You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs . Ferrars ' s kindness is ."
" Upon the knoll behind the house .
" She seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous .-- Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten .-- She must have a great deal to leave ."
" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ?"
I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better .
Dorsetshire !
Sir John was ready to like anybody , and though Mr . Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses , he soon set him down as a very good - natured fellow : while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having ; and Mr . Dashwood went away delighted with both .
Good gracious !-- In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on -- that is to be my mother !"
Her complexion was sallow ; and her features small , without beauty , and naturally without expression ; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity , by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature .
She was not a woman of many words ; for , unlike people in general , she proportioned them to the number of her ideas ; and of the few syllables that did escape her , not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood , whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events .
But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four .
But there was no peculiar disgrace in this ; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors , who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable -- Want of sense , either natural or improved -- want of elegance -- want of spirits -- or want of temper .
The parties stood thus :
" These are done by my eldest sister ," said he ; " and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them .
The Colonel , though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship , warmly admired the screens , as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood ; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited , they were handed round for general inspection .
" They are very pretty , ma ' am -- an ' t they ?"
Marianne ' s feelings did not stop here .
" Dear , dear Elinor , don ' t mind them .
She could say no more ; her spirits were quite overcome , and hiding her face on Elinor ' s shoulder , she burst into tears .
Every body ' s attention was called , and almost every body was concerned .-- Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did .-- Mrs .
poor dear ," immediately gave her her salts ; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress , that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele , and gave her , in a whisper , a brief account of the whole shocking affair .
said her brother to Colonel Brandon , in a low voice , as soon as he could secure his attention ,-- " She has not such good health as her sister ,-- she is very nervous ,-- she has not Elinor ' s constitution ;-- and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions .
CHAPTER 35
Elinor ' s curiosity to see Mrs . Ferrars was satisfied .-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable .-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free ;-- and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs . Ferrars ' s creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion .
" I never was in better health ."
I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world !-- Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship ."
I could not have stood it .
She met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister .
This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy , who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression .
" Do you like London ?"
" Not at all .
you are what you always were !"
" But why were you not there , Edward ?-- Why did you not come ?"
Elinor was very angry , but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied ,
said Marianne ; " my dear Edward , this must not be ."
Within a few days after this meeting , the newspapers announced to the world , that the lady of Thomas Palmer , Esq .
It was censure in common use , and easily given .
Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy .
It checked the idleness of one , and the business of the other .
Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr . Willoughby , she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner , which their arrival occasioned .
But this conciliation was not granted ; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor , and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne , no effect was produced , but a look of indifference from the former , or of disgust in the latter .
Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor !
Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity ; she saw every thing , and asked every thing ; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne ' s dress ; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself , and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted , how much her washing cost per week , and how much she had every year to spend upon herself .
With such encouragement as this , was she dismissed on the present occasion , to her brother ' s carriage ; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door , a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister - in - law , who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance , and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman .
As Elinor was neither musical , nor affecting to be so , she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte , whenever it suited her , and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp , and violoncello , would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room .
Happy had it been for her , if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit , than on the merit of his nearest relations !
" You reside in Devonshire , I think ,"-- was his next observation , " in a cottage near Dawlish ."
I advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage .
Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought .
Fanny paused a moment , and then , with fresh vigor , said ,
" My love I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power .
Sir John , who called on them more than once , brought home such accounts of the favour they were in , as must be universally striking .
Mrs . Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy by her Christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them .
have you heard the news ?"
But you shall hear it all .-- When I got to Mr . Palmer ' s , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child .
So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord !
my dear ,' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum --' and nurse said just the same .
is Fanny ill ?"
So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this .
' Lord !'
So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride .
She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother ' s ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country .
Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do .
what a taking poor Mr . Edward will be in when he hears of it !
Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs . Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it .
What Mrs . Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself .
For HIM she felt much compassion ;-- for Lucy very little -- and it cost her some pains to procure that little ;-- for the rest of the party none at all .
" Four months !-- Have you known of this four months ?"
" Four months !"
" Yes .
But I did not love only him ;-- and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt .
I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself .
I acquit Edward of essential misconduct .
" I understand you .-- You do not suppose that I have ever felt much .-- For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least .-- It was told me ,-- it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph .-- This person ' s suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested ;-- and it has not been only once ;-- I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again .-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection .-- Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me .-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages .-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness .-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW .
The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion ;-- they did not spring up of themselves ;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first .-- No , Marianne .-- THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy ."
In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness ;-- to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her ;-- and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality .-- These were great concessions ;-- but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make .
" Your sister ," he continued , " has suffered dreadfully .
It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter .
But I am sorry to relate what ensued .
Here Marianne , in an ecstasy of indignation , clapped her hands together , and cried , " Gracious God !
" All this , however ," he continued , " was urged in vain .
Edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner .
Born to the prospect of such affluence !
Marianne ' s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs . Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party .
" Get it all out of her , my dear .
" I am monstrous glad of it .
Once Lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that .
" How !"
And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said ."
What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an ' t she ?
And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight .
You have got your answer ready ."
I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer .
" Wait for his having a living !-- ay , we all know how THAT will end :-- they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr . Steele and Mr . Pratt can give her .-- Then they will have a child every year !
I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs . Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother ' s anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs . Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr . Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us .-- Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs . Jennings won ' t think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her .-- My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne ,
That was just like Lucy .-- Poor soul !
CHAPTER 39
The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne ' s impatience to be gone increased every day .
The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs . Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them .
When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious .
From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day ' s journey ; and their mother ' s servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time .
" This is very strange !-- sure he need not wait to be older ."
What had really passed between them was to this effect .
" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty ,"-- he replied , with great feeling ,--" of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible .-- Mrs . Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to .
" The smallness of the house ," said she , " I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income ."
There are not many men who would act as he has done .
my dear , you are very modest .
" Opportunity !"
I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it ."
very well ," said Mrs . Jennings rather disappointed .
I shall do THAT directly .
" And so YOU are forced to do it .
" I have just been thinking of Betty ' s sister , my dear .
Elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all .
I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke .)
What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him .
" You are very much mistaken .
I have had no hand in it .
For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak ;-- at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said ,
" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St . James Street ," said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair .
Did not I do right ?-- And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ?"
" Well , and how soon will he be ready ?-- For it seems all to depend upon that ."
" My dear ma ' am ," said Elinor , " what can you be thinking of ?-- Why , Colonel Brandon ' s only object is to be of use to Mr .
So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood ' s part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued .
It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife ' s indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit .-- This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions .
He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in .
" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose ," said he :--" I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU .-- Very far from it , indeed .
I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS .
When Edward ' s unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible .
Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother ' s tone , calmly replied ,
But however , all that is quite out of the question -- not to be thought of or mentioned -- as to any attachment you know -- it never could be -- all that is gone by .
You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance .-- Poor Edward !-- His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature .-- But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers ,-- the same address .-- Poor fellow !-- to see him in a circle of strangers !-- to be sure it was pitiable enough !-- but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth .
Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward .
I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere .
Marianne , few as had been her hours of comfort in London , and eager as she had long been to quit it , could not , when it came to the point , bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes , and that confidence , in Willoughby , which were now extinguished for ever , without great pain .
The second day brought them into the cherished , or the prohibited , county of Somerset , for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne ' s imagination ; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland .
Cleveland was a spacious , modern - built house , situated on a sloping lawn .
She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house , on an excursion through its more immediate premises ; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away , in lounging round the kitchen garden , examining the bloom upon its walls , and listening to the gardener ' s lamentations upon blights , in dawdling through the green - house , where the loss of her favourite plants , unwarily exposed , and nipped by the lingering frost , raised the laughter of Charlotte ,-- and in visiting her poultry - yard , where , in the disappointed hopes of her dairy - maid , by hens forsaking their nests , or being stolen by a fox , or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood , she found fresh sources of merriment .
The morning was fine and dry , and Marianne , in her plan of employment abroad , had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland .
She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple , and perhaps all over the grounds , and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it ; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking .
Elinor , however little concerned in it , joined in their discourse ; and Marianne , who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library , however it might be avoided by the family in general , soon procured herself a book .
She found him , however , perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors , and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother ; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion , and only prevented from being so always , by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general , as he must feel himself to be to Mrs . Jennings and Charlotte .
Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr . Ferrars , and the kind of confidant of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them .-- His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs . Jennings ' s persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself .
Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments .
Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs . Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon .
The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one .
The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse .
He tried to reason himself out of fears , which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd ; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone , were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea , and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more .
But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began .-- Towards the evening Marianne became ill again , growing more heavy , restless , and uncomfortable than before .
Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it .
" But she must not go round by London ," cried Marianne , in the same hurried manner .
Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself , and , while attempting to soothe her , eagerly felt her pulse .
Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome .
Elinor , catching all , and more than all , his fears in a moment , proposed to call in further advice .
Half an hour passed away , and the favourable symptom yet blessed her .
Others even arose to confirm it .
Mrs . Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep .
The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house .
She rushed to the drawing - room ,-- she entered it ,-- and saw only Willoughby .
The servants , I suppose , forgot to tell you that Mr . Palmer was not in the house ."
-- in the utmost amazement --" well , sir ,-- be quick -- and if you can -- less violent ."
But she had promised to hear him , and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged .
" Your sister ," said he , with abruptness , a moment afterwards --" is out of danger .
" We hope she is ."
" Had I known as much half an hour ago -- But since I AM here ,"-- speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat --" what does it signify ?-- For once , Miss Dashwood -- it will be the last time , perhaps -- let us be cheerful together .-- I am in a fine mood for gaiety .-- Tell me honestly "-- a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks -- " do you think me most a knave or a fool ?"
She began to think that be must be in liquor ;-- the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose , saying ,
-- cried Elinor , more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at .
" Mr . Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse .-- What is it , that you mean by it ?"
" If that is all , you may be satisfied already ,-- for Marianne DOES -- she has LONG forgiven you ."
-- he cried , in the same eager tone .-- " Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it .
" I insist on you hearing the whole of it ," he replied , " My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself .
" To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness !-- Is there a man on earth who could have done it ?-- Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless .
Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed .
I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound .
The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever .
The struggle was great -- but it ended too soon .
I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do .
A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire ;-- I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement .
But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate .
To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution .
Willoughby ?"
I was miserable .
My journey to town -- travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously -- no creature to speak to -- my own reflections so cheerful -- when I looked forward every thing so inviting !-- when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing !-- oh , it was a blessed journey !"
He stopped .
Elinor ' s heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again ;-- yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last .
I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street ;-- but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name ."
She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue ."
" Well , let me make haste and be gone .
" We are assured of it ."
" But the letter , Mr . Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ?"
" Yes , yes , THAT in particular .
Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning .
Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever .
The original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction .
Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly .
As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs . Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c .-- I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John .
From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said --
" As to that ," said he , " I must rub through the world as well as I can .
Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again --"
And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive .
But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less .
Elinor ' s delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep ;-- but Mrs . Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her .
Mrs . Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , in compliance with her mother ' s entreaty , went to bed .
Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her ;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor .
I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child ;-- he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne .
" His character , however ," answered Elinor , " does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him .
Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other .
Poor Elinor !-- here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford !-- but her spirit was stubborn .
At his and Mrs . Jennings ' s united request in return , Mrs . Dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back , for the better accommodation of her sick child ; and the Colonel , at the joint invitation of Mrs . Dashwood and Mrs . Jennings , whose active good - nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself , engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage , in the course of a few weeks .
Mrs . Dashwood and Elinor then followed , and the others were left by themselves , to talk of the travellers , and feel their own dullness , till Mrs . Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions ; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford .
Willing therefore to delay the evil hour , she resolved to wait till her sister ' s health were more secure , before she appointed it .
Marianne had been two or three days at home , before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out .
Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered ,
" Do you compare your conduct with his ?"
" No .
Marianne pressed her hand and replied ,
As for Willoughby -- to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle .
His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions .
CHAPTER 47
Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon .
" It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear ."
" Happy with a man of libertine practices !-- With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men !-- No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man !-- Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt ."
Marianne ' s lips quivered , and she repeated the word " Selfish ?"
" The whole of his behaviour ," replied Elinor , " from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness .
Marianne would not let her proceed ;-- and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister ' s spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued ,
" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby ' s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams .
Marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon Elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics .
I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma ' am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr . Ferrars ' s , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they ' d make sure to come and see you ."
" Was there no one else in the carriage ?"
" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy -- Mrs . Ferrars told me ."
Mrs . Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed .
But he was now married ; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery , which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence .
Colonel Brandon must have some information to give .
Were it possible , she must say it must be Edward .
She looked again .
" He comes from Mr . Pratt ' s purposely to see us .
In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake .
His countenance , as he entered the room , was not too happy , even for Elinor .
He coloured , seemed perplexed , looked doubtingly , and , after some hesitation , said ,--
" Mrs . Robert Ferrars !"
Edward , who had till then looked any where , rather than at her , saw her hurry away , and perhaps saw -- or even heard , her emotion ; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie , which no remarks , no inquiries , no affectionate address of Mrs . Dashwood could penetrate , and at last , without saying a word , quitted the room , and walked out towards the village -- leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation , so wonderful and so sudden ;-- a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures .
Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr . Pratt , I think -- nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done .
But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen .
" Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another ' s .
" I thought it my duty ," said he , " independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me .
And even now , I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world .
He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart , and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement .
After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these :-- The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself ."
Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs . Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life .
came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs . Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world ;-- so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs . Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again .
Robert ' s offence was unpardonable , but Lucy ' s was infinitely worse .
He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour .-- " And if they really DO interest themselves ," said Marianne , in her new character of candour , " in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit ."
Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating .
With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn .
Mrs . Jennings ' s prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world .
Mrs . Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed .
Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate .
And the evening and the morning were the first day .
And the evening and the morning were the second day .
1 : 9 And God said , Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
1 : 12 And the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
1 : 20 And God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
1 : 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day .
1 : 24 And God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
1 : 29 And God said , Behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
2 : 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the host of them .
2 : 6 But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
3 : 1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made .
3 : 4 And the serpent said unto the woman , Ye shall not surely die : 3 : 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
3 : 9 And the LORD God called unto Adam , and said unto him , Where art thou ?
3 : 12 And the man said , The woman whom thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
4 : 1 And Adam knew Eve his wife ; and she conceived , and bare Cain , and said , I have gotten a man from the LORD .
And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering : 4 : 5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect .
4 : 17 And Cain knew his wife ; and she conceived , and bare Enoch : and he builded a city , and called the name of the city , after the name of his son , Enoch .
6 : 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD .
6 : 11 The earth also was corrupt before God , and the earth was filled with violence .
6 : 18 But with thee will I establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy sons , and thy wife , and thy sons ' wives with thee .
6 : 20 Of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive .
7 : 1 And the LORD said unto Noah , Come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation .
8 : 5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
8 : 8 Also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ; 8 : 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
8 : 10 And he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ; 8 : 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
8 : 12 And he stayed yet other seven days ; and sent forth the dove ; which returned not again unto him any more .
8 : 18 And Noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him : 8 : 19 Every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark .
9 : 3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things .
9 : 20 And Noah began to be an husbandman , and he planted a vineyard : 9 : 21 And he drank of the wine , and was drunken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
10 : 2 The sons of Japheth ; Gomer , and Magog , and Madai , and Javan , and Tubal , and Meshech , and Tiras .
10 : 7 And the sons of Cush ; Seba , and Havilah , and Sabtah , and Raamah , and Sabtechah : and the sons of Raamah ; Sheba , and Dedan .
10 : 15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born , and Heth , 10 : 16 And the Jebusite , and the Amorite , and the Girgasite , 10 : 17 And the Hivite , and the Arkite , and the Sinite , 10 : 18 And the Arvadite , and the Zemarite , and the Hamathite : and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad .
10 : 25 And unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother ' s name was Joktan .
11 : 2 And it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar ; and they dwelt there .
And they had brick for stone , and slime had they for morter .
11 : 9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel ; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
11 : 31 And Terah took Abram his son , and Lot the son of Haran his son ' s son , and Sarai his daughter in law , his son Abram ' s wife ; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan ; and they came unto Haran , and dwelt there .
12 : 14 And it came to pass , that , when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
13 : 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of Jordan , that it was well watered every where , before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah , even as the garden of the LORD , like the land of Egypt , as thou comest unto Zoar .
13 : 16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
14 : 5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer , and the kings that were with him , and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim , and the Zuzims in Ham , and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim , 14 : 6 And the Horites in their mount Seir , unto Elparan , which is by the wilderness .
14 : 12 And they took Lot , Abram ' s brother ' s son , who dwelt in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
14 : 15 And he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smote them , and pursued them unto Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
14 : 19 And he blessed him , and said , Blessed be Abram of the most high God , possessor of heaven and earth : 14 : 20 And blessed be the most high God , which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand .
15 : 11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases , Abram drove them away .
15 : 15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
15 : 18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram , saying , Unto thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the river Euphrates : 15 : 19 The Kenites , and the Kenizzites , and the Kadmonites , 15 : 20 And the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Rephaims , 15 : 21 And the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Girgashites , and the Jebusites .
And when Sarai dealt hardly with her , she fled from her face .
And she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai .
16 : 12 And he will be a wild man ; his hand will be against every man , and every man ' s hand against him ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
17 : 3 And Abram fell on his face : and God talked with him , saying , 17 : 4 As for me , behold , my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nations .
17 : 21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac , which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
17 : 23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham ' s house ; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God had said unto him .
And Sarah heard it in the tent door , which was behind him .
18 : 11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age ; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
18 : 12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself , saying , After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure , my lord being old also ?
18 : 16 And the men rose up from thence , and looked toward Sodom : and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
And he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
19 : 24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven ; 19 : 25 And he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
20 : 4 But Abimelech had not come near her : and he said , LORD , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ?
20 : 5 Said he not unto me , She is my sister ?
and she , even she herself said , He is my brother : in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this .
and what have I offended thee , that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ?
20 : 12 And yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
21 : 10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham , Cast out this bondwoman and her son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac .
21 : 16 And she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bow shot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child .
21 : 22 And it came to pass at that time , that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou doest : 21 : 23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me , nor with my son , nor with my son ' s son : but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee , thou shalt do unto me , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned .
22 : 7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I , my son .
23 : 8 And he communed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar , 23 : 9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
23 : 10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth : and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying , 23 : 11 Nay , my lord , hear me : the field give I thee , and the cave that is therein , I give it thee ; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee : bury thy dead .
23 : 12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land .
24 : 20 And she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
24 : 24 And she said unto him , I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah , which she bare unto Nahor .
24 : 46 And she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
24 : 48 And I bowed down my head , and worshipped the LORD , and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master ' s brother ' s daughter unto his son .
24 : 50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said , The thing proceedeth from the LORD : we cannot speak unto thee bad or good .
24 : 58 And they called Rebekah , and said unto her , Wilt thou go with this man ?
25 : 1 Then again Abraham took a wife , and her name was Keturah .
25 : 5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac .
And Isaac said unto him , Because I said , Lest I die for her .
26 : 23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba .
27 : 18 And he came unto his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I ; who art thou , my son ?
27 : 20 And Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ?
And he said , I am thy son , thy firstborn Esau .
27 : 34 And when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
And he said , Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me ?
27 : 43 Now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; arise , flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran ; 27 : 44 And tarry with him a few days , until thy brother ' s fury turn away ; 27 : 45 Until thy brother ' s anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast done to him : then I will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should I be deprived also of you both in one day ?
27 : 46 And Rebekah said to Isaac , I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth : if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
28 : 1 And Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
28 : 5 And Isaac sent away Jacob : and he went to Padanaram unto Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob ' s and Esau ' s mother .
28 : 10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba , and went toward Haran .
28 : 19 And he called the name of that place Bethel : but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
28 : 20 And Jacob vowed a vow , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and raiment to put on , 28 : 21 So that I come again to my father ' s house in peace ; then shall the LORD be my God : 28 : 22 And this stone , which I have set for a pillar , shall be God ' s house : and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee .
29 : 9 And while he yet spake with them , Rachel came with her father ' s sheep ; for she kept them .
tell me , what shall thy wages be ?
29 : 21 And Jacob said unto Laban , Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in unto her .
30 : 26 Give me my wives and my children , for whom I have served thee , and let me go : for thou knowest my service which I have done thee .
30 : 27 And Laban said unto him , I pray thee , if I have found favour in thine eyes , tarry : for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake .
30 : 34 And Laban said , Behold , I would it might be according to thy word .
30 : 36 And he set three days ' journey betwixt himself and Jacob : and Jacob fed the rest of Laban ' s flocks .
30 : 40 And Jacob did separate the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of Laban ; and he put his own flocks by themselves , and put them not unto Laban ' s cattle .
30 : 41 And it came to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
31 : 1 And he heard the words of Laban ' s sons , saying , Jacob hath taken away all that was our father ' s ; and of that which was our father ' s hath he gotten all this glory .
31 : 7 And your father hath deceived me , and changed my wages ten times ; but God suffered him not to hurt me .
31 : 8 If he said thus , The speckled shall be thy wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he said thus , The ringstraked shall be thy hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstraked .
31 : 15 Are we not counted of him strangers ?
Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount : and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead .
And he searched but found not the images .
31 : 36 And Jacob was wroth , and chode with Laban : and Jacob answered and said to Laban , What is my trespass ?
31 : 39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
32 : 2 And when Jacob saw them , he said , This is God ' s host : and he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
32 : 21 So went the present over before him : and himself lodged that night in the company .
And he said , Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name ?
And he divided the children unto Leah , and unto Rachel , and unto the two handmaids .
33 : 4 And Esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , and fell on his neck , and kissed him : and they wept .
33 : 11 Take , I pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee ; because God hath dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough .
33 : 14 Let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Seir .
let me find grace in the sight of my lord .
33 : 20 And he erected there an altar , and called it EleloheIsrael .
34 : 4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor , saying , Get me this damsel to wife .
34 : 5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter : now his sons were with his cattle in the field : and Jacob held his peace until they were come .
34 : 7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it : and the men were grieved , and they were very wroth , because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob ' s daughter : which thing ought not to be done .
34 : 17 But if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
34 : 18 And their words pleased Hamor , and Shechem Hamor ' s son .
34 : 20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying , 34 : 21 These men are peaceable with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
34 : 23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their ' s be our ' s ?
34 : 25 And it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , Dinah ' s brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and slew all the males .
34 : 26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem ' s house , and went out .
35 : 1 And God said unto Jacob , Arise , go up to Bethel , and dwell there : and make there an altar unto God , that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother .
35 : 7 And he built there an altar , and called the place Elbethel : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
35 : 8 But Deborah Rebekah ' s nurse died , and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak : and the name of it was called Allonbachuth .
35 : 13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him .
35 : 21 And Israel journeyed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar .
36 : 7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together ; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle .
36 : 25 And the children of Anah were these ; Dishon , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah .
36 : 32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom : and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
36 : 34 And Jobab died , and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead .
36 : 39 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pau ; and his wife ' s name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
Joseph , being seventeen years old , was feeding the flock with his brethren ; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah , and with the sons of Zilpah , his father ' s wives : and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report .
37 : 28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
38 : 7 And Er , Judah ' s firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD slew him .
38 : 10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD : wherefore he slew him also .
38 : 12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah ' s wife died ; and Judah was comforted , and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
38 : 13 And it was told Tamar , saying , Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep .
38 : 14 And she put her widow ' s garments off from her , and covered her with a vail , and wrapped herself , and sat in an open place , which is by the way to Timnath ; for she saw that Shelah was grown , and she was not given unto him to wife .
38 : 17 And he said , I will send thee a kid from the flock .
And Judah said , Bring her forth , and let her be burnt .
And he knew her again no more .
this breach be upon thee : therefore his name was called Pharez .
39 : 1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
39 : 3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him , and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
And Joseph was a goodly person , and well favoured .
39 : 10 And it came to pass , as she spake to Joseph day by day , that he hearkened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
39 : 17 And she spake unto him according to these words , saying , The Hebrew servant , which thou hast brought unto us , came in unto me to mock me : 39 : 18 And it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
40 : 1 And it came to pass after these things , that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt .
40 : 21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again ; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh ' s hand : 40 : 22 But he hanged the chief baker : as Joseph had interpreted to them .
41 : 28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh : What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh .
41 : 36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
41 : 42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph ' s hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ; 41 : 43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had ; and they cried before him , Bow the knee : and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt .
42 : 2 And he said , Behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
42 : 16 Send one of you , and let him fetch your brother , and ye shall be kept in prison , that your words may be proved , whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies .
And they did so .
42 : 36 And Jacob their father said unto them , Me have ye bereaved of my children : Joseph is not , and Simeon is not , and ye will take Benjamin away : all these things are against me .
43 : 3 And Judah spake unto him , saying , The man did solemnly protest unto us , saying , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
43 : 9 I will be surety for him ; of my hand shalt thou require him : if I bring him not unto thee , and set him before thee , then let me bear the blame for ever : 43 : 10 For except we had lingered , surely now we had returned this second time .
43 : 16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the ruler of his house , Bring these men home , and slay , and make ready ; for these men shall dine with me at noon .
43 : 19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph ' s house , and they communed with him at the door of the house , 43 : 20 And said , O sir , we came indeed down at the first time to buy food : 43 : 21 And it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man ' s money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
44 : 3 As soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
ye have done evil in so doing .
44 : 10 And he said , Now also let it be according unto your words : he with whom it is found shall be my servant ; and ye shall be blameless .
44 : 11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground , and opened every man his sack .
44 : 12 And he searched , and began at the eldest , and left at the youngest : and the cup was found in Benjamin ' s sack .
44 : 16 And Judah said , What shall we say unto my lord ?
what shall we speak ?
44 : 17 And he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
44 : 32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father , saying , If I bring him not unto thee , then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
44 : 33 Now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father .
45 : 3 And Joseph said unto his brethren , I am Joseph ; doth my father yet live ?
45 : 6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
45 : 8 So now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
45 : 13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
45 : 14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin ' s neck , and wept ; and Benjamin wept upon his neck .
45 : 24 So he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
46 : 9 And the sons of Reuben ; Hanoch , and Phallu , and Hezron , and Carmi .
46 : 15 These be the sons of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram , with his daughter Dinah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
46 : 16 And the sons of Gad ; Ziphion , and Haggi , Shuni , and Ezbon , Eri , and Arodi , and Areli .
46 : 21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah , and Becher , and Ashbel , Gera , and Naaman , Ehi , and Rosh , Muppim , and Huppim , and Ard .
46 : 22 These are the sons of Rachel , which were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
46 : 33 And it shall come to pass , when Pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , What is your occupation ?
46 : 34 That ye shall say , Thy servants ' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
47 : 10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from before Pharaoh .
47 : 13 And there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
47 : 14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh ' s house .
47 : 23 Then Joseph said unto the people , Behold , I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh : lo , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
48 : 5 And now thy two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
48 : 8 And Israel beheld Joseph ' s sons , and said , Who are these ?
48 : 12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
48 : 18 And Joseph said unto his father , Not so , my father : for this is the firstborn ; put thy right hand upon his head .
48 : 22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow .
49 : 3 Reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power : 49 : 4 Unstable as water , thou shalt not excel ; because thou wentest up to thy father ' s bed ; then defiledst thou it : he went up to my couch .
49 : 10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah , nor a lawgiver from between his feet , until Shiloh come ; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be .
49 : 32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth .
50 : 9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen : and it was a very great company .
50 : 11 And when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning in the floor of Atad , they said , This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians : wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim , which is beyond Jordan .
50 : 15 And when Joseph ' s brethren saw that their father was dead , they said , Joseph will peradventure hate us , and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him .
1 : 5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls : for Joseph was in Egypt already .
1 : 6 And Joseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
1 : 15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah : 1 : 16 And he said , When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them upon the stools ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
1 : 18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , Why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ?
And the maid went and called the child ' s mother .
2 : 21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man : and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter .
2 : 25 And God looked upon the children of Israel , and God had respect unto them .
3 : 2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he looked , and , behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
And Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
3 : 11 And Moses said unto God , Who am I , that I should go unto Pharaoh , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
what shall I say unto them ?
4 : 3 And he said , Cast it on the ground .
And he put his hand into his bosom : and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow .
4 : 11 And the LORD said unto him , Who hath made man ' s mouth ?
And also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in his heart .
4 : 20 And Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
4 : 22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh , Thus saith the LORD , Israel is my son , even my firstborn : 4 : 23 And I say unto thee , Let my son go , that he may serve me : and if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will slay thy son , even thy firstborn .
4 : 27 And the LORD said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses .
5 : 4 And the king of Egypt said unto them , Wherefore do ye , Moses and Aaron , let the people from their works ?
5 : 9 Let there more work be laid upon the men , that they may labour therein ; and let them not regard vain words .
5 : 10 And the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spake to the people , saying , Thus saith Pharaoh , I will not give you straw .
5 : 22 And Moses returned unto the LORD , and said , LORD , wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people ?
6 : 16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations ; Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari : and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years .
6 : 23 And Aaron took him Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Naashon , to wife ; and she bare him Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
7 : 1 And the LORD said unto Moses , See , I have made thee a god to Pharaoh : and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
7 : 6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them , so did they .
7 : 7 And Moses was fourscore years old , and Aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto Pharaoh .
7 : 12 For they cast down every man his rod , and they became serpents : but Aaron ' s rod swallowed up their rods .
7 : 14 And the LORD said unto Moses , Pharaoh ' s heart is hardened , he refuseth to let the people go .
7 : 16 And thou shalt say unto him , The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee , saying , Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
7 : 23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to this also .
8 : 13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
8 : 19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh , This is the finger of God : and Pharaoh ' s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
8 : 24 And the LORD did so ; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses , and into all the land of Egypt : the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies .
8 : 32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also , neither would he let the people go .
9 : 2 For if thou refuse to let them go , and wilt hold them still , 9 : 3 Behold , the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
9 : 5 And the LORD appointed a set time , saying , To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land .
9 : 7 And Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead .
9 : 24 So there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
9 : 27 And Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said unto them , I have sinned this time : the LORD is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
9 : 30 But as for thee and thy servants , I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God .
10 : 18 And he went out from Pharaoh , and intreated the LORD .
10 : 20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh ' s heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go .
10 : 29 And Moses said , Thou hast spoken well , I will see thy face again no more .
11 : 1 And the LORD said unto Moses , Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh , and upon Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh ' s servants , and in the sight of the people .
11 : 9 And the LORD said unto Moses , Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt .
12 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying , 12 : 2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
12 : 3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house : 12 : 4 And if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
12 : 7 And they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
12 : 21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said unto them , Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the passover .
12 : 24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
12 : 26 And it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , What mean ye by this service ?
And they spoiled the Egyptians .
12 : 49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
12 : 50 Thus did all the children of Israel ; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
13 : 6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD .
13 : 9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the LORD ' s law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt .
13 : 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him : for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you .
14 : 4 And I will harden Pharaoh ' s heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host ; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD .
14 : 5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled : and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people , and they said , Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from serving us ?
14 : 15 And the LORD said unto Moses , Wherefore criest thou unto me ?
14 : 18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
14 : 26 And the LORD said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen .
14 : 27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
15 : 1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the LORD , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
15 : 2 The LORD is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my father ' s God , and I will exalt him .
15 : 3 The LORD is a man of war : the LORD is his name .
15 : 6 Thy right hand , O LORD , is become glorious in power : thy right hand , O LORD , hath dashed in pieces the enemy .
15 : 13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
15 : 15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away .
15 : 16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , O LORD , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
16 : 5 And it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
your murmurings are not against us , but against the LORD .
16 : 20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and Moses was wroth with them .
16 : 22 And it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man : and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses .
16 : 29 See , for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
16 : 31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna : and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
16 : 34 As the LORD commanded Moses , so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony , to be kept .
17 : 2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses , and said , Give us water that we may drink .
17 : 9 And Moses said unto Joshua , Choose us out men , and go out , fight with Amalek : to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand .
17 : 15 And Moses built an altar , and called the name of it Jehovahnissi : 17 : 16 For he said , Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation .
18 : 12 And Jethro , Moses ' father in law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father in law before God .
18 : 13 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening .
19 : 3 And Moses went up unto God , and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ; 19 : 4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians , and how I bare you on eagles ' wings , and brought you unto myself .
And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD .
19 : 10 And the LORD said unto Moses , Go unto the people , and sanctify them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes , 19 : 11 And be ready against the third day : for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai .
19 : 17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
19 : 20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
19 : 24 And the LORD said unto him , Away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD , lest he break forth upon them .
20 : 1 And God spake all these words , saying , 20 : 2 I am the LORD thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
20 : 9 Six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work : 20 : 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates : 20 : 11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
20 : 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery .
20 : 15 Thou shalt not steal .
20 : 20 And Moses said unto the people , Fear not : for God is come to prove you , and that his fear may be before your faces , that ye sin not .
20 : 25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone : for if thou lift up thy tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
21 : 28 If an ox gore a man or a woman , that they die : then the ox shall be surely stoned , and his flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the ox shall be quit .
22 : 8 If the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour ' s goods .
22 : 9 For all manner of trespass , whether it be for ox , for ass , for sheep , for raiment , or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his , the cause of both parties shall come before the judges ; and whom the judges shall condemn , he shall pay double unto his neighbour .
22 : 19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death .
22 : 23 If thou afflict them in any wise , and they cry at all unto me , I will surely hear their cry ; 22 : 24 And my wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
23 : 1 Thou shalt not raise a false report : put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
23 : 12 Six days thou shalt do thy work , and on the seventh day thou shalt rest : that thine ox and thine ass may rest , and the son of thy handmaid , and the stranger , may be refreshed .
23 : 15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread : ( thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days , as I commanded thee , in the time appointed of the month Abib ; for in it thou camest out from Egypt : and none shall appear before me empty :) 23 : 16 And the feast of harvest , the firstfruits of thy labours , which thou hast sown in the field : and the feast of ingathering , which is in the end of the year , when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field .
23 : 25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God , and he shall bless thy bread , and thy water ; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee .
23 : 33 They shall not dwell in thy land , lest they make thee sin against me : for if thou serve their gods , it will surely be a snare unto thee .
24 : 7 And he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the LORD hath said will we do , and be obedient .
24 : 15 And Moses went up into the mount , and a cloud covered the mount .
24 : 18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud , and gat him up into the mount : and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
25 : 3 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them ; gold , and silver , and brass , 25 : 4 And blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ' hair , 25 : 5 And rams ' skins dyed red , and badgers ' skins , and shittim wood , 25 : 6 Oil for the light , spices for anointing oil , and for sweet incense , 25 : 7 Onyx stones , and stones to be set in the ephod , and in the breastplate .
25 : 22 And there I will meet with thee , and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat , from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony , of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel .
25 : 23 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood : two cubits shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
25 : 25 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about , and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about .
25 : 26 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold , and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof .
25 : 28 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold , that the table may be borne with them .
25 : 34 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds , with their knops and their flowers .
25 : 35 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick .
26 : 6 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold , and couple the curtains together with the taches : and it shall be one tabernacle .
26 : 16 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board , and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board .
26 : 17 Two tenons shall there be in one board , set in order one against another : thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
26 : 19 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
26 : 24 And they shall be coupled together beneath , and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring : thus shall it be for them both ; they shall be for the two corners .
26 : 25 And they shall be eight boards , and their sockets of silver , sixteen sockets ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
27 : 5 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath , that the net may be even to the midst of the altar .
27 : 6 And thou shalt make staves for the altar , staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with brass .
27 : 12 And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits : their pillars ten , and their sockets ten .
28 : 9 And thou shalt take two onyx stones , and grave on them the names of the children of Israel : 28 : 10 Six of their names on one stone , and the other six names of the rest on the other stone , according to their birth .
28 : 16 Foursquare it shall be being doubled ; a span shall be the length thereof , and a span shall be the breadth thereof .
28 : 17 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones , even four rows of stones : the first row shall be a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this shall be the first row .
28 : 24 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate .
28 : 29 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart , when he goeth in unto the holy place , for a memorial before the LORD continually .
28 : 33 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , round about the hem thereof ; and bells of gold between them round about : 28 : 34 A golden bell and a pomegranate , a golden bell and a pomegranate , upon the hem of the robe round about .
28 : 40 And for Aaron ' s sons thou shalt make coats , and thou shalt make for them girdles , and bonnets shalt thou make for them , for glory and for beauty .
29 : 5 And thou shalt take the garments , and put upon Aaron the coat , and the robe of the ephod , and the ephod , and the breastplate , and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod : 29 : 6 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head , and put the holy crown upon the mitre .
29 : 7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil , and pour it upon his head , and anoint him .
29 : 11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
29 : 15 Thou shalt also take one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
29 : 18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar : it is a burnt offering unto the LORD : it is a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
29 : 20 Then shalt thou kill the ram , and take of his blood , and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron , and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons , and upon the thumb of their right hand , and upon the great toe of their right foot , and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
29 : 32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram , and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
29 : 42 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD : where I will meet you , to speak there unto thee .
30 : 1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon : of shittim wood shalt thou make it .
30 : 29 And thou shalt sanctify them , that they may be most holy : whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy .
30 : 34 And the LORD said unto Moses , Take unto thee sweet spices , stacte , and onycha , and galbanum ; these sweet spices with pure frankincense : of each shall there be a like weight : 30 : 35 And thou shalt make it a perfume , a confection after the art of the apothecary , tempered together , pure and holy : 30 : 36 And thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
31 : 17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed .
32 : 2 And Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
32 : 5 And when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it ; and Aaron made proclamation , and said , To morrow is a feast to the LORD .
32 : 6 And they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
Turn from thy fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against thy people .
32 : 22 And Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief .
32 : 25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked ; ( for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies :) 32 : 26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Who is on the LORD ' s side ?
32 : 27 And he said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .
32 : 33 And the LORD said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book .
33 : 6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb .
33 : 14 And he said , My presence shall go with thee , and I will give thee rest .
so shall we be separated , I and thy people , from all the people that are upon the face of the earth .
33 : 19 And he said , I will make all my goodness pass before thee , and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee ; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy .
33 : 20 And he said , Thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see me , and live .
34 : 2 And be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai , and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount .
34 : 3 And no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount .
34 : 6 And the LORD passed by before him , and proclaimed , The LORD , The LORD God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth , 34 : 7 Keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children ' s children , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
34 : 11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
34 : 20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem him not , then shalt thou break his neck .
34 : 24 For I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year .
34 : 25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
34 : 31 And Moses called unto them ; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him : and Moses talked with them .
35 : 22 And they came , both men and women , as many as were willing hearted , and brought bracelets , and earrings , and rings , and tablets , all jewels of gold : and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD .
35 : 34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .
35 : 35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart , to work all manner of work , of the engraver , and of the cunning workman , and of the embroiderer , in blue , and in purple , in scarlet , and in fine linen , and of the weaver , even of them that do any work , and of those that devise cunning work .
36 : 2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it : 36 : 3 And they received of Moses all the offering , which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it withal .
36 : 6 And Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary .
36 : 14 And he made curtains of goats ' hair for the tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains he made them .
36 : 17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling , and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
36 : 27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards .
36 : 31 And he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle , 36 : 32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward .
36 : 33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other .
36 : 36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
37 : 20 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds , his knops , and his flowers : 37 : 21 And a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
37 : 24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it , and all the vessels thereof .
38 : 3 And he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , and the shovels , and the basons , and the fleshhooks , and the firepans : all the vessels thereof made he of brass .
38 : 15 And for the other side of the court gate , on this hand and that hand , were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
38 : 17 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
38 : 19 And their pillars were four , and their sockets of brass four ; their hooks of silver , and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver .
38 : 23 And with him was Aholiab , son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , an engraver , and a cunning workman , and an embroiderer in blue , and in purple , and in scarlet , and fine linen .
38 : 25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents , and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary : 38 : 26 A bekah for every man , that is , half a shekel , after the shekel of the sanctuary , for every one that went to be numbered , from twenty years old and upward , for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men .
38 : 29 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents , and two thousand and four hundred shekels .
39 : 4 They made shoulderpieces for it , to couple it together : by the two edges was it coupled together .
39 : 10 And they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this was the first row .
39 : 18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod , before it .
39 : 20 And they made two other golden rings , and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart of it , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
39 : 23 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of an habergeon , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
39 : 31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue , to fasten it on high upon the mitre ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
40 : 4 And thou shalt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick , and light the lamps thereof .
40 : 5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony , and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle .
40 : 7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
40 : 17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
The Third Book of Moses : Called Leviticus
1 : 11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD : and the priests , Aaron ' s sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
3 : 3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards , 3 : 4 And the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
3 : 6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock ; male or female , he shall offer it without blemish .
3 : 9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; the fat thereof , and the whole rump , it shall he take off hard by the backbone ; and the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards , 3 : 10 And the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
3 : 13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
4 : 16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock ' s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation : 4 : 17 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD , even before the vail .
4 : 27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ; 4 : 28 Or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
5 : 17 And if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
6 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 6 : 2 If a soul sin , and commit a trespass against the LORD , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ; 6 : 3 Or have found that which was lost , and lieth concerning it , and sweareth falsely ; in any of all these that a man doeth , sinning therein : 6 : 4 Then it shall be , because he hath sinned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found , 6 : 5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more thereto , and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth , in the day of his trespass offering .
6 : 10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
6 : 14 And this is the law of the meat offering : the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD , before the altar .
6 : 16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it .
6 : 28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken : and if it be sodden in a brasen pot , it shall be both scoured , and rinsed in water .
7 : 1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering : it is most holy .
7 : 8 And the priest that offereth any man ' s burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
7 : 12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving , then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil , and unleavened wafers anointed with oil , and cakes mingled with oil , of fine flour , fried .
7 : 13 Besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings .
7 : 15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
7 : 18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day , it shall not be accepted , neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it : it shall be an abomination , and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity .
7 : 35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron , and of the anointing of his sons , out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest ' s office ; 7 : 36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
8 : 4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him ; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
8 : 6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons , and washed them with water .
8 : 13 And Moses brought Aaron ' s sons , and put coats upon them , and girded them with girdles , and put bonnets upon them ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
8 : 14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering .
8 : 29 And Moses took the breast , and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD : for of the ram of consecration it was Moses ' part ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
8 : 31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons , Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations , as I commanded , saying , Aaron and his sons shall eat it .
8 : 32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
9 : 16 And he brought the burnt offering , and offered it according to the manner .
9 : 24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
10 : 1 And Nadab and Abihu , the sons of Aaron , took either of them his censer , and put fire therein , and put incense thereon , and offered strange fire before the LORD , which he commanded them not .
And Aaron held his peace .
10 : 7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you .
10 : 14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place ; thou , and thy sons , and thy daughters with thee : for they be thy due , and thy sons ' due , which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel .
10 : 18 Behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place : ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded .
11 : 8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch ; they are unclean to you .
11 : 9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters , in the seas , and in the rivers , them shall ye eat .
11 : 21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four , which have legs above their feet , to leap withal upon the earth ; 11 : 22 Even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
11 : 28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .
11 : 31 These are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they be dead , shall be unclean until the even .
11 : 32 And upon whatsoever any of them , when they are dead , doth fall , it shall be unclean ; whether it be any vessel of wood , or raiment , or skin , or sack , whatsoever vessel it be , wherein any work is done , it must be put into water , and it shall be unclean until the even ; so it shall be cleansed .
11 : 36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit , wherein there is plenty of water , shall be clean : but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean .
12 : 6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled , for a son , or for a daughter , she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering , and a young pigeon , or a turtledove , for a sin offering , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , unto the priest : 12 : 7 Who shall offer it before the LORD , and make an atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood .
13 : 24 Or if there be any flesh , in the skin whereof there is a hot burning , and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot , somewhat reddish , or white ; 13 : 25 Then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the hair in the bright spot be turned white , and it be in sight deeper than the skin ; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning : wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the plague of leprosy .
13 : 28 And if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the priest shall pronounce him clean : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
13 : 42 And if there be in the bald head , or bald forehead , a white reddish sore ; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head , or his bald forehead .
13 : 52 He shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
14 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 14 : 2 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : He shall be brought unto the priest : 14 : 3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ; 14 : 4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop : 14 : 5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water : 14 : 6 As for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water : 14 : 7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
14 : 19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering , and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness ; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering : 14 : 20 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar : and the priest shall make an atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
14 : 49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop : 14 : 50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water : 14 : 51 And he shall take the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the slain bird , and in the running water , and sprinkle the house seven times : 14 : 52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird , and with the running water , and with the living bird , and with the cedar wood , and with the hyssop , and with the scarlet : 14 : 53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields , and make an atonement for the house : and it shall be clean .
15 : 4 Every bed , whereon he lieth that hath the issue , is unclean : and every thing , whereon he sitteth , shall be unclean .
15 : 10 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even : and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
15 : 11 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
15 : 16 And if any man ' s seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
15 : 17 And every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
15 : 22 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
15 : 30 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness .
15 : 31 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness ; that they die not in their uncleanness , when they defile my tabernacle that is among them .
16 : 5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering , and one ram for a burnt offering .
16 : 7 And he shall take the two goats , and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
16 : 17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an atonement for himself , and for his household , and for all the congregation of Israel .
16 : 23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation , and shall put off the linen garments , which he put on when he went into the holy place , and shall leave them there : 16 : 24 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place , and put on his garments , and come forth , and offer his burnt offering , and the burnt offering of the people , and make an atonement for himself , and for the people .
16 : 31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you , and ye shall afflict your souls , by a statute for ever .
17 : 12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel , No soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
18 : 3 After the doings of the land of Egypt , wherein ye dwelt , shall ye not do : and after the doings of the land of Canaan , whither I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ordinances .
18 : 6 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him , to uncover their nakedness : I am the LORD .
18 : 10 The nakedness of thy son ' s daughter , or of thy daughter ' s daughter , even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover : for theirs is thine own nakedness .
18 : 12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father ' s sister : she is thy father ' s near kinswoman .
18 : 18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister , to vex her , to uncover her nakedness , beside the other in her life time .
19 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 19 : 2 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Ye shall be holy : for I the LORD your God am holy .
19 : 5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD , ye shall offer it at your own will .
19 : 9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
19 : 10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : I am the LORD your God .
19 : 27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard .
19 : 31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits , neither seek after wizards , to be defiled by them : I am the LORD your God .
20 : 6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
20 : 9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath cursed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
20 : 10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man ' s wife , even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour ' s wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death .
20 : 25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean , and between unclean fowls and clean : and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast , or by fowl , or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground , which I have separated from you as unclean .
21 : 1 And the LORD said unto Moses , Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron , and say unto them , There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people : 21 : 2 But for his kin , that is near unto him , that is , for his mother , and for his father , and for his son , and for his daughter , and for his brother .
21 : 24 And Moses told it unto Aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of Israel .
And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead , or a man whose seed goeth from him ; 22 : 5 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatsoever uncleanness he hath ; 22 : 6 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he wash his flesh with water .
22 : 10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing : a sojourner of the priest , or an hired servant , shall not eat of the holy thing .
22 : 22 Blind , or broken , or maimed , or having a wen , or scurvy , or scabbed , ye shall not offer these unto the LORD , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD .
23 : 3 Six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest , an holy convocation ; ye shall do no work therein : it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings .
23 : 5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD ' s passover .
23 : 29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
23 : 35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
24 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 24 : 2 Command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
24 : 5 And thou shalt take fine flour , and bake twelve cakes thereof : two tenth deals shall be in one cake .
24 : 22 Ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of your own country : for I am the LORD your God .
25 : 7 And for thy cattle , and for the beast that are in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be meat .
25 : 11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed .
25 : 13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession .
25 : 19 And the land shall yield her fruit , and ye shall eat your fill , and dwell therein in safety .
25 : 22 And ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
25 : 23 The land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine , for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
25 : 30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations : it shall not go out in the jubile .
25 : 33 And if a man purchase of the Levites , then the house that was sold , and the city of his possession , shall go out in the year of jubile : for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
25 : 35 And if thy brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
25 : 36 Take thou no usury of him , or increase : but fear thy God ; that thy brother may live with thee .
25 : 37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury , nor lend him thy victuals for increase .
25 : 38 I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
25 : 55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
26 : 5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land safely .
26 : 8 And five of you shall chase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
26 : 12 And I will walk among you , and will be your God , and ye shall be my people .
26 : 14 But if ye will not hearken unto me , and will not do all these commandments ; 26 : 15 And if ye shall despise my statutes , or if your soul abhor my judgments , so that ye will not do all my commandments , but that ye break my covenant : 26 : 16 I also will do this unto you ; I will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eyes , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow your seed in vain , for your enemies shall eat it .
26 : 19 And I will break the pride of your power ; and I will make your heaven as iron , and your earth as brass : 26 : 20 And your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
27 : 10 He shall not alter it , nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good : and if he shall at all change beast for beast , then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
27 : 15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it , and it shall be his .
27 : 34 These are the commandments , which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai .
1 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the tabernacle of the congregation , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying , 1 : 2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel , after their families , by the house of their fathers , with the number of their names , every male by their polls ; 1 : 3 From twenty years old and upward , all that are able to go forth to war in Israel : thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies .
1 : 7 Of Judah ; Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
1 : 17 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by their names : 1 : 18 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month , and they declared their pedigrees after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , by their polls .
1 : 19 As the LORD commanded Moses , so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai .
1 : 20 And the children of Reuben , Israel ' s eldest son , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , by their polls , every male from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ; 1 : 21 Those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of Reuben , were forty and six thousand and five hundred .
1 : 34 Of the children of Manasseh , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ; 1 : 35 Those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of Manasseh , were thirty and two thousand and two hundred .
1 : 48 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses , saying , 1 : 49 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi , neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel : 1 : 50 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony , and over all the vessels thereof , and over all things that belong to it : they shall bear the tabernacle , and all the vessels thereof ; and they shall minister unto it , and shall encamp round about the tabernacle .
2 : 12 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon : and the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai .
2 : 17 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp : as they encamp , so shall they set forward , every man in his place by their standards .
2 : 18 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies : and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud .
3 : 16 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD , as he was commanded .
3 : 40 And the LORD said unto Moses , Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
4 : 7 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue , and put thereon the dishes , and the spoons , and the bowls , and covers to cover withal : and the continual bread shall be thereon : 4 : 8 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet , and cover the same with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put in the staves thereof .
4 : 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying , 4 : 18 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites : 4 : 19 But thus do unto them , that they may live , and not die , when they approach unto the most holy things : Aaron and his sons shall go in , and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden : 4 : 20 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered , lest they die .
4 : 31 And this is the charge of their burden , according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation ; the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and sockets thereof , 4 : 32 And the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .
5 : 25 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman ' s hand , and shall wave the offering before the LORD , and offer it upon the altar : 5 : 26 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
5 : 27 And when he hath made her to drink the water , then it shall come to pass , that , if she be defiled , and have done trespass against her husband , that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter , and her belly shall swell , and her thigh shall rot : and the woman shall be a curse among her people .
5 : 28 And if the woman be not defiled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
5 : 29 This is the law of jealousies , when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband , and is defiled ; 5 : 30 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him , and he be jealous over his wife , and shall set the woman before the LORD , and the priest shall execute upon her all this law .
6 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 6 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite , to separate themselves unto the LORD : 6 : 3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink , and shall drink no vinegar of wine , or vinegar of strong drink , neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes , nor eat moist grapes , or dried .
6 : 5 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
6 : 18 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and shall take the hair of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
7 : 18 On the second day Nethaneel the son of Zuar , prince of Issachar , did offer : 7 : 19 He offered for his offering one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering : 7 : 20 One spoon of gold of ten shekels , full of incense : 7 : 21 One young bullock , one ram , one lamb of the first year , for a burnt offering : 7 : 22 One kid of the goats for a sin offering : 7 : 23 And for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Nethaneel the son of Zuar .
7 : 87 All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks , the rams twelve , the lambs of the first year twelve , with their meat offering : and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve .
9 : 8 And Moses said unto them , Stand still , and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you .
9 : 16 So it was alway : the cloud covered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
9 : 22 Or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle , remaining thereon , the children of Israel abode in their tents , and journeyed not : but when it was taken up , they journeyed .
10 : 5 When ye blow an alarm , then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward .
10 : 8 And the sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow with the trumpets ; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations .
10 : 10 Also in the day of your gladness , and in your solemn days , and in the beginnings of your months , ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings , and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings ; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God : I am the LORD your God .
10 : 17 And the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward , bearing the tabernacle .
10 : 23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
10 : 26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran .
10 : 30 And he said unto him , I will not go ; but I will depart to mine own land , and to my kindred .
11 : 9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night , the manna fell upon it .
11 : 14 I am not able to bear all this people alone , because it is too heavy for me .
12 : 1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married : for he had married an Ethiopian woman .
And the LORD heard it .
12 : 7 My servant Moses is not so , who is faithful in all mine house .
12 : 8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold : wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ?
13 : 7 Of the tribe of Issachar , Igal the son of Joseph .
13 : 17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said unto them , Get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain : 13 : 18 And see the land , what it is , and the people that dwelleth therein , whether they be strong or weak , few or many ; 13 : 19 And what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds ; 13 : 20 And what the land is , whether it be fat or lean , whether there be wood therein , or not .
13 : 26 And they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word unto them , and unto all the congregation , and shewed them the fruit of the land .
14 : 5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
14 : 8 If the LORD delight in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
14 : 36 And the men , which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up a slander upon the land , 14 : 37 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the LORD .
14 : 43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye are turned away from the LORD , therefore the LORD will not be with you .
15 : 13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner , in offering an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
15 : 28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD , to make an atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
15 : 29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them .
15 : 33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron , and unto all the congregation .
15 : 41 I am the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the LORD your God .
16 : 12 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab : which said , We will not come up : 16 : 13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
16 : 14 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ?
16 : 20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying , 16 : 21 Separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them in a moment .
16 : 27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
17 : 7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness .
18 : 1 And the LORD said unto Aaron , Thou and thy sons and thy father ' s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood .
18 : 6 And I , behold , I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the LORD , to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
18 : 7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest ' s office for everything of the altar , and within the vail ; and ye shall serve : I have given your priest ' s office unto you as a service of gift : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
18 : 14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine .
18 : 21 And , behold , I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
18 : 24 But the tithes of the children of Israel , which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD , I have given to the Levites to inherit : therefore I have said unto them , Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
19 : 13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the LORD ; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel : because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him , he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is yet upon him .
20 : 6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them .
20 : 7 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 20 : 8 Take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and Aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes ; and it shall give forth his water , and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink .
20 : 19 And the children of Israel said unto him , We will go by the high way : and if I and my cattle drink of thy water , then I will pay for it : I will only , without doing anything else , go through on my feet .
20 : 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up unto mount Hor : 20 : 26 And strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
20 : 29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they mourned for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
21 : 3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and he called the name of the place Hormah .
21 : 23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
21 : 24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok , even unto the children of Ammon : for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
21 : 30 We have shot at them ; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon , and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah , which reacheth unto Medeba .
21 : 35 So they smote him , and his sons , and all his people , until there was none left him alive : and they possessed his land .
22 : 8 And he said unto them , Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as the LORD shall speak unto me : and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam .
22 : 18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak , If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God , to do less or more .
Now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
22 : 27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD , she fell down under Balaam : and Balaam ' s anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with a staff .
22 : 34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD , I have sinned ; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me : now therefore , if it displease thee , I will get me back again .
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
22 : 40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep , and sent to Balaam , and to the princes that were with him .
23 : 4 And God met Balaam : and he said unto him , I have prepared seven altars , and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram .
Let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
23 : 14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
And Balak said unto him , What hath the LORD spoken ?
24 : 7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than Agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
24 : 10 And Balak ' s anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
24 : 12 And Balaam said unto Balak , Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me , saying , 24 : 13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD , to do either good or bad of mine own mind ; but what the LORD saith , that will I speak ?
24 : 14 And now , behold , I go unto my people : come therefore , and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days .
24 : 15 And he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said : 24 : 16 He hath said , which heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the most High , which saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open : 24 : 17 I shall see him , but not now : I shall behold him , but not nigh : there shall come a Star out of Jacob , and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel , and shall smite the corners of Moab , and destroy all the children of Sheth .
24 : 19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion , and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city .
25 : 14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
26 : 12 The sons of Simeon after their families : of Nemuel , the family of the Nemuelites : of Jamin , the family of the Jaminites : of Jachin , the family of the Jachinites : 26 : 13 Of Zerah , the family of the Zarhites : of Shaul , the family of the Shaulites .
26 : 15 The children of Gad after their families : of Zephon , the family of the Zephonites : of Haggi , the family of the Haggites : of Shuni , the family of the Shunites : 26 : 16 Of Ozni , the family of the Oznites : of Eri , the family of the Erites : 26 : 17 Of Arod , the family of the Arodites : of Areli , the family of the Arelites .
26 : 30 These are the sons of Gilead : of Jeezer , the family of the Jeezerites : of Helek , the family of the Helekites : 26 : 31 And of Asriel , the family of the Asrielites : and of Shechem , the family of the Shechemites : 26 : 32 And of Shemida , the family of the Shemidaites : and of Hepher , the family of the Hepherites .
26 : 33 And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
26 : 41 These are the sons of Benjamin after their families : and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and six hundred .
26 : 42 These are the sons of Dan after their families : of Shuham , the family of the Shuhamites .
26 : 55 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
27 : 2 And they stood before Moses , and before Eleazar the priest , and before the princes and all the congregation , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , saying , 27 : 3 Our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
27 : 4 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ?
27 : 5 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD .
27 : 9 And if he have no daughter , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren .
27 : 20 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him , that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient .
28 : 3 And thou shalt say unto them , This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD ; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day , for a continual burnt offering .
28 : 8 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even : as the meat offering of the morning , and as the drink offering thereof , thou shalt offer it , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
28 : 9 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot , and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , and the drink offering thereof : 28 : 10 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
29 : 7 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation ; and ye shall afflict your souls : ye shall not do any work therein : 29 : 8 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without blemish : 29 : 9 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals to a bullock , and two tenth deals to one ram , 29 : 10 A several tenth deal for one lamb , throughout the seven lambs : 29 : 11 One kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the sin offering of atonement , and the continual burnt offering , and the meat offering of it , and their drink offerings .
29 : 29 And on the sixth day eight bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish : 29 : 30 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner : 29 : 31 And one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
30 : 2 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
30 : 8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vow which she vowed , and that which she uttered with her lips , wherewith she bound her soul , of none effect : and the LORD shall forgive her .
30 : 14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day ; then he establisheth all her vows , or all her bonds , which are upon her : he confirmeth them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
31 : 4 Of every tribe a thousand , throughout all the tribes of Israel , shall ye send to the war .
31 : 6 And Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
31 : 19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
31 : 53 ( For the men of war had taken spoil , every man for himself .)
32 : 8 Thus did your fathers , when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land .
32 : 13 And the LORD ' s anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the LORD , was consumed .
32 : 19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan , or forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward .
32 : 33 And Moses gave unto them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , with the cities thereof in the coasts , even the cities of the country round about .
33 : 4 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn , which the LORD had smitten among them : upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments .
33 : 5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses , and pitched in Succoth .
33 : 21 And they removed from Libnah , and pitched at Rissah .
33 : 23 And they went from Kehelathah , and pitched in mount Shapher .
33 : 40 And king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
33 : 47 And they removed from Almondiblathaim , and pitched in the mountains of Abarim , before Nebo .
34 : 16 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 34 : 17 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun .
34 : 18 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe , to divide the land by inheritance .
34 : 19 And the names of the men are these : Of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
34 : 28 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali , Pedahel the son of Ammihud .
35 : 4 And the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
35 : 5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits , and on the south side two thousand cubits , and on the west side two thousand cubits , and on the north side two thousand cubits ; and the city shall be in the midst : this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities .
35 : 8 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel : from them that have many ye shall give many ; but from them that have few ye shall give few : every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth .
35 : 16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
35 : 19 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer : when he meeteth him , he shall slay him .
36 : 1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spake before Moses , and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of Israel : 36 : 2 And they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
36 : 4 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
36 : 10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses , so did the daughters of Zelophehad : 36 : 11 For Mahlah , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married unto their father ' s brothers ' sons : 36 : 12 And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
1 : 9 And I spake unto you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you myself alone : 1 : 10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you , and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
1 : 19 And when we departed from Horeb , we went through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites , as the LORD our God commanded us ; and we came to Kadeshbarnea .
1 : 40 But as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .
And we went over the brook Zered .
3 : 13 And the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
3 : 22 Ye shall not fear them : for the LORD your God he shall fight for you .
3 : 25 I pray thee , let me go over , and see the good land that is beyond Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon .
3 : 28 But charge Joshua , and encourage him , and strengthen him : for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see .
4 : 21 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes , and sware that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance : 4 : 22 But I must die in this land , I must not go over Jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
4 : 32 For ask now of the days that are past , which were before thee , since the day that God created man upon the earth , and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other , whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is , or hath been heard like it ?
4 : 33 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and live ?
4 : 35 Unto thee it was shewed , that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God ; there is none else beside him .
5 : 11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain : for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
5 : 27 Go thou near , and hear all that the LORD our God shall say : and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
6 : 1 Now these are the commandments , the statutes , and the judgments , which the LORD your God commanded to teach you , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it : 6 : 2 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son ' s son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
6 : 16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God , as ye tempted him in Massah .
6 : 24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear the LORD our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as it is at this day .
8 : 1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers .
8 : 5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart , that , as a man chasteneth his son , so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee .
8 : 10 When thou hast eaten and art full , then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee .
9 : 9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you , then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water : 9 : 10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them was written according to all the words , which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
9 : 13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me , saying , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people : 9 : 14 Let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under heaven : and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they .
But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also .
10 : 5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount , and put the tables in the ark which I had made ; and there they be , as the LORD commanded me .
10 : 11 And the LORD said unto me , Arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them .
11 : 16 Take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ; 11 : 17 And then the LORD ' s wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you .
12 : 16 Only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
12 : 17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn , or of thy wine , or of thy oil , or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock , nor any of thy vows which thou vowest , nor thy freewill offerings , or heave offering of thine hand : 12 : 18 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the Levite that is within thy gates : and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto .
12 : 23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
12 : 29 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee , whither thou goest to possess them , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their land ; 12 : 30 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them , after that they be destroyed from before thee ; and that thou enquire not after their gods , saying , How did these nations serve their gods ?
13 : 4 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and ye shall serve him , and cleave unto him .
13 : 5 And that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams , shall be put to death ; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in .
14 : 1 Ye are the children of the LORD your God : ye shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
14 : 11 Of all clean birds ye shall eat .
14 : 23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God , in the place which he shall choose to place his name there , the tithe of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks ; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always .
15 : 7 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother : 15 : 8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wanteth .
15 : 13 And when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty : 15 : 14 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
15 : 19 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock , nor shear the firstling of thy sheep .
15 : 20 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose , thou and thy household .
15 : 21 And if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God .
16 : 4 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days ; neither shall there any thing of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
16 : 9 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
16 : 16 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose ; in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles : and they shall not appear before the LORD empty : 16 : 17 Every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee .
16 : 22 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image ; which the LORD thy God hateth .
17 : 6 At the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is worthy of death be put to death ; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
17 : 17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
17 : 18 And it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites : 17 : 19 And it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the LORD his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them : 17 : 20 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he , and his children , in the midst of Israel .
18 : 12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD : and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee .
18 : 15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hearken ; 18 : 16 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
18 : 20 But the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
19 : 15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall the matter be established .
19 : 16 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ; 19 : 17 Then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before the LORD , before the priests and the judges , which shall be in those days ; 19 : 18 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and hath testified falsely against his brother ; 19 : 19 Then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
20 : 1 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the LORD thy God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
20 : 12 And if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it : 20 : 13 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword : 20 : 14 But the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the LORD thy God hath given thee .
21 : 21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
22 : 4 Thou shalt not see thy brother ' s ass or his ox fall down by the way , and hide thyself from them : thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again .
22 : 5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman ' s garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God .
22 : 10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together .
22 : 23 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ; 22 : 24 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city , and ye shall stone them with stones that they die ; the damsel , because she cried not , being in the city ; and the man , because he hath humbled his neighbour ' s wife : so thou shalt put away evil from among you .
23 : 17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel , nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel .
24 : 10 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing , thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
24 : 12 And if the man be poor , thou shalt not sleep with his pledge : 24 : 13 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
24 : 20 When thou beatest thine olive tree , thou shalt not go over the boughs again : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
25 : 16 For all that do such things , and all that do unrighteously , are an abomination unto the LORD thy God .
26 : 4 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand , and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God .
26 : 15 Look down from thy holy habitation , from heaven , and bless thy people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou swarest unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
26 : 16 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
27 : 17 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour ' s landmark .
27 : 23 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law .
27 : 26 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them .
28 : 3 Blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed shalt thou be in the field .
28 : 8 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
28 : 9 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God , and walk in his ways .
28 : 17 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store .
28 : 49 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far , from the end of the earth , as swift as the eagle flieth ; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand ; 28 : 50 A nation of fierce countenance , which shall not regard the person of the old , nor shew favour to the young : 28 : 51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle , and the fruit of thy land , until thou be destroyed : which also shall not leave thee either corn , wine , or oil , or the increase of thy kine , or flocks of thy sheep , until he have destroyed thee .
30 : 8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD , and do all his commandments which I command thee this day .
30 : 15 See , I have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ; 30 : 16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God , to walk in his ways , and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments , that thou mayest live and multiply : and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
31 : 9 And Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
31 : 17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day , and I will forsake them , and I will hide my face from them , and they shall be devoured , and many evils and troubles shall befall them ; so that they will say in that day , Are not these evils come upon us , because our God is not among us ?
31 : 19 Now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
31 : 21 And it shall come to pass , when many evils and troubles are befallen them , that this song shall testify against them as a witness ; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed : for I know their imagination which they go about , even now , before I have brought them into the land which I sware .
32 : 4 He is the Rock , his work is perfect : for all his ways are judgment : a God of truth and without iniquity , just and right is he .
32 : 13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ; 32 : 14 Butter of kine , and milk of sheep , with fat of lambs , and rams of the breed of Bashan , and goats , with the fat of kidneys of wheat ; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape .
32 : 15 But Jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
32 : 16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods , with abominations provoked they him to anger .
32 : 19 And when the LORD saw it , he abhorred them , because of the provoking of his sons , and of his daughters .
32 : 26 I said , I would scatter them into corners , I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men : 32 : 27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
32 : 31 For their rock is not as our Rock , even our enemies themselves being judges .
32 : 36 For the LORD shall judge his people , and repent himself for his servants , when he seeth that their power is gone , and there is none shut up , or left .
let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
32 : 39 See now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
33 : 5 And he was king in Jeshurun , when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together .
33 : 10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments , and Israel thy law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
33 : 27 The eternal God is thy refuge , and underneath are the everlasting arms : and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee ; and shall say , Destroy them .
and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee ; and thou shalt tread upon their high places .
And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead , unto Dan , 34 : 2 And all Naphtali , and the land of Ephraim , and Manasseh , and all the land of Judah , unto the utmost sea , 34 : 3 And the south , and the plain of the valley of Jericho , the city of palm trees , unto Zoar .
34 : 5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of the LORD .
1 : 3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses .
1 : 5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
1 : 7 Only be thou strong and very courageous , that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law , which Moses my servant commanded thee : turn not from it to the right hand or to the left , that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest .
1 : 9 Have not I commanded thee ?
1 : 16 And they answered Joshua , saying , All that thou commandest us we will do , and whithersoever thou sendest us , we will go .
2 : 1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly , saying , Go view the land , even Jericho .
2 : 18 Behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by : and thou shalt bring thy father , and thy mother , and thy brethren , and all thy father ' s household , home unto thee .
3 : 7 And the LORD said unto Joshua , This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel , that they may know that , as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee .
3 : 12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
4 : 19 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , in the east border of Jericho .
4 : 23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the LORD your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we were gone over : 4 : 24 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD , that it is mighty : that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever .
5 : 3 And Joshua made him sharp knives , and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins .
5 : 6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness , till all the people that were men of war , which came out of Egypt , were consumed , because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD : unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land , which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
And Joshua did so .
6 : 1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel : none went out , and none came in .
6 : 2 And the LORD said unto Joshua , See , I have given into thine hand Jericho , and the king thereof , and the mighty men of valour .
6 : 7 And he said unto the people , Pass on , and compass the city , and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD .
6 : 8 And it came to pass , when Joshua had spoken unto the people , that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns passed on before the LORD , and blew with the trumpets : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them .
6 : 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they compassed the city seven times .
7 : 2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is beside Bethaven , on the east of Bethel , and spake unto them , saying , Go up and view the country .
And the men went up and viewed Ai .
7 : 7 And Joshua said , Alas , O LORD God , wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us ?
would to God we had been content , and dwelt on the other side Jordan !
7 : 14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes : and it shall be , that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof ; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households ; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man .
7 : 15 And it shall be , that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he hath : because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD , and because he hath wrought folly in Israel .
the LORD shall trouble thee this day .
8 : 15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wilderness .
And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city .
8 : 26 For Joshua drew not his hand back , wherewith he stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
8 : 32 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
8 : 33 And all Israel , and their elders , and officers , and their judges , stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , as well the stranger , as he that was born among them ; half of them over against mount Gerizim , and half of them over against mount Ebal ; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before , that they should bless the people of Israel .
Now their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kirjathjearim .
And all the congregation murmured against the princes .
9 : 20 This we will do to them ; we will even let them live , lest wrath be upon us , because of the oath which we sware unto them .
9 : 21 And the princes said unto them , Let them live ; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation ; as the princes had promised them .
10 : 5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and encamped before Gibeon , and made war against it .
10 : 22 Then said Joshua , Open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave .
10 : 34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon , and all Israel with him ; and they encamped against it , and fought against it : 10 : 35 And they took it on that day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
10 : 42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time , because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel .
11 : 7 So Joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of Merom suddenly ; and they fell upon them .
11 : 13 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength , Israel burned none of them , save Hazor only ; that did Joshua burn .
11 : 21 And at that time came Joshua , and cut off the Anakims from the mountains , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the mountains of Judah , and from all the mountains of Israel : Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities .
11 : 22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , there remained .
12 : 6 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
12 : 7 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west , from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak , that goeth up to Seir ; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions ; 12 : 8 In the mountains , and in the valleys , and in the plains , and in the springs , and in the wilderness , and in the south country ; the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites : 12 : 9 The king of Jericho , one ; the king of Ai , which is beside Bethel , one ; 12 : 10 The king of Jerusalem , one ; the king of Hebron , one ; 12 : 11 The king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ; 12 : 12 The king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ; 12 : 13 The king of Debir , one ; the king of Geder , one ; 12 : 14 The king of Hormah , one ; the king of Arad , one ; 12 : 15 The king of Libnah , one ; the king of Adullam , one ; 12 : 16 The king of Makkedah , one ; the king of Bethel , one ; 12 : 17 The king of Tappuah , one ; the king of Hepher , one ; 12 : 18 The king of Aphek , one ; the king of Lasharon , one ; 12 : 19 The king of Madon , one ; the king of Hazor , one ; 12 : 20 The king of Shimronmeron , one ; the king of Achshaph , one ; 12 : 21 The king of Taanach , one ; the king of Megiddo , one ; 12 : 22 The king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam of Carmel , one ; 12 : 23 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor , one ; the king of the nations of Gilgal , one ; 12 : 24 The king of Tirzah , one : all the kings thirty and one .
13 : 24 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad , even unto the children of Gad according to their families .
13 : 25 And their coast was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , unto Aroer that is before Rabbah ; 13 : 26 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh , and Betonim ; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir ; 13 : 27 And in the valley , Betharam , and Bethnimrah , and Succoth , and Zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon , Jordan and his border , even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward .
13 : 29 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh : and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families .
This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families .
15 : 13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah , according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua , even the city of Arba the father of Anak , which city is Hebron .
15 : 14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak , Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
15 : 20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families .
16 : 9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
17 : 17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only : 17 : 18 But the mountain shall be thine ; for it is a wood , and thou shalt cut it down : and the outgoings of it shall be thine : for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites , though they have iron chariots , and though they be strong .
18 : 2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes , which had not yet received their inheritance .
18 : 8 And the men arose , and went away : and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land , saying , Go and walk through the land , and describe it , and come again to me , that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh .
18 : 12 And their border on the north side was from Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side , and went up through the mountains westward ; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven .
18 : 14 And the border was drawn thence , and compassed the corner of the sea southward , from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward ; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal , which is Kirjathjearim , a city of the children of Judah : this was the west quarter .
This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
19 : 16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families , these cities with their villages .
19 : 17 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar , for the children of Issachar according to their families .
19 : 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families , the cities and their villages .
19 : 51 These are the inheritances , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD , at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
21 : 13 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Libnah with her suburbs , 21 : 14 And Jattir with her suburbs , and Eshtemoa with her suburbs , 21 : 15 And Holon with her suburbs , and Debir with her suburbs , 21 : 16 And Ain with her suburbs , and Juttah with her suburbs , and Bethshemesh with her suburbs ; nine cities out of those two tribes .
21 : 17 And out of the tribe of Benjamin , Gibeon with her suburbs , Geba with her suburbs , 21 : 18 Anathoth with her suburbs , and Almon with her suburbs ; four cities .
21 : 20 And the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
21 : 44 And the LORD gave them rest round about , according to all that he sware unto their fathers : and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them ; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand .
21 : 45 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel ; all came to pass .
22 : 12 And when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up to war against them .
22 : 28 Therefore said we , that it shall be , when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come , that we may say again , Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD , which our fathers made , not for burnt offerings , nor for sacrifices ; but it is a witness between us and you .
23 : 2 And Joshua called for all Israel , and for their elders , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers , and said unto them , I am old and stricken in age : 23 : 3 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you ; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you .
24 : 13 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour , and cities which ye built not , and ye dwell in them ; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat .
24 : 26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the LORD .
24 : 31 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua , and which had known all the works of the LORD , that he had done for Israel .
24 : 33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died ; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son , which was given him in mount Ephraim .
1 : 6 But Adonibezek fled ; and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
And they brought him to Jerusalem , and there he died .
1 : 15 And she said unto him , Give me a blessing : for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water .
1 : 17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath , and utterly destroyed it .
And the name of the city was called Hormah .
1 : 23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel .
1 : 25 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city , they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all his family .
1 : 30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites dwelt among them , and became tributaries .
2 : 8 And Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the LORD , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
3 : 19 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , I have a secret errand unto thee , O king : who said , Keep silence .
3 : 24 When he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parlour were locked , they said , Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber .
3 : 25 And they tarried till they were ashamed : and , behold , he opened not the doors of the parlour ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
3 : 27 And it came to pass , when he was come , that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim , and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount , and he before them .
3 : 31 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath , which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad : and he also delivered Israel .
4 : 8 And Barak said unto her , If thou wilt go with me , then I will go : but if thou wilt not go with me , then I will not go .
4 : 11 Now Heber the Kenite , which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses , had severed himself from the Kenites , and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim , which is by Kedesh .
4 : 15 And the LORD discomfited Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his host , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
4 : 18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said unto him , Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not .
So he died .
5 : 6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied , and the travellers walked through byways .
5 : 12 Awake , awake , Deborah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , Barak , and lead thy captivity captive , thou son of Abinoam .
O my soul , thou hast trodden down strength .
5 : 22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings , the pransings of their mighty ones .
5 : 27 At her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
6 : 6 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites ; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD .
6 : 11 And there came an angel of the LORD , and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite : and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
6 : 12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him , and said unto him , The LORD is with thee , thou mighty man of valour .
6 : 17 And he said unto him , If now I have found grace in thy sight , then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me .
6 : 19 And Gideon went in , and made ready a kid , and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out unto him under the oak , and presented it .
for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face .
will ye save him ?
7 : 7 And the LORD said unto Gideon , By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you , and deliver the Midianites into thine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto his place .
7 : 10 But if thou fear to go down , go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host : 7 : 11 And thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host .
Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
7 : 13 And when Gideon was come , behold , there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow , and said , Behold , I dreamed a dream , and , lo , a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian , and came unto a tent , and smote it that it fell , and overturned it , that the tent lay along .
7 : 16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man ' s hand , with empty pitchers , and lamps within the pitchers .
7 : 21 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp ; and all the host ran , and cried , and fled .
8 : 12 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled , he pursued after them , and took the two kings of Midian , Zebah and Zalmunna , and discomfited all the host .
But the youth drew not his sword : for he feared , because he was yet a youth .
8 : 27 And Gideon made an ephod thereof , and put it in his city , even in Ophrah : and all Israel went thither a whoring after it : which thing became a snare unto Gideon , and to his house .
8 : 31 And his concubine that was in Shechem , she also bare him a son , whose name he called Abimelech .
remember also that I am your bone and your flesh .
9 : 8 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said unto the olive tree , Reign thou over us .
9 : 11 But the fig tree said unto them , Should I forsake my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
9 : 22 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel , 9 : 23 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech : 9 : 24 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come , and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother , which slew them ; and upon the men of Shechem , which aided him in the killing of his brethren .
9 : 26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren , and went over to Shechem : and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him .
9 : 29 And would to God this people were under my hand !
then would I remove Abimelech .
And he said to Abimelech , Increase thine army , and come out .
9 : 37 And Gaal spake again , and said , See there come people down by the middle of the land , and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim .
9 : 46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that , they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith .
9 : 56 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech , which he did unto his father , in slaying his seventy brethren : 9 : 57 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads : and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
10 : 12 The Zidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , did oppress you ; and ye cried to me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
11 : 10 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , The LORD be witness between us , if we do not so according to thy words .
did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them , 11 : 26 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns , and in Aroer and her towns , and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon , three hundred years ?
12 : 3 And when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the LORD delivered them into my hand : wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
13 : 2 And there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and bare not .
13 : 4 Now therefore beware , I pray thee , and drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing : 13 : 5 For , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
13 : 8 Then Manoah intreated the LORD , and said , O my Lord , let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us , and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born .
13 : 14 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that I commanded her let her observe .
13 : 16 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah , Though thou detain me , I will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the LORD .
13 : 21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife .
Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD .
14 : 1 And Samson went down to Timnath , and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines .
14 : 11 And it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
And they said unto him , Put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it .
14 : 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day , that they said unto Samson ' s wife , Entice thy husband , that he may declare unto us the riddle , lest we burn thee and thy father ' s house with fire : have ye called us to take that we have ?
14 : 18 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down , What is sweeter than honey ?
And what is stronger than a lion ?
14 : 20 But Samson ' s wife was given to his companion , whom he had used as his friend .
15 : 4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes , and took firebrands , and turned tail to tail , and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails .
15 : 9 Then the Philistines went up , and pitched in Judah , and spread themselves in Lehi .
16 : 11 And he said unto her , If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
16 : 15 And she said unto him , How canst thou say , I love thee , when thine heart is not with me ?
16 : 16 And it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ; 16 : 17 That he told her all his heart , and said unto her , There hath not come a razor upon mine head ; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother ' s womb : if I be shaven , then my strength will go from me , and I shall become weak , and be like any other man .
16 : 20 And she said , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson .
16 : 24 And when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
16 : 28 And Samson called unto the LORD , and said , O Lord God , remember me , I pray thee , and strengthen me , I pray thee , only this once , O God , that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes .
16 : 31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father .
And he said unto him , I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah , and I go to sojourn where I may find a place .
17 : 11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons .
and what makest thou in this place ?
18 : 5 And they said unto him , Ask counsel , we pray thee , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
18 : 13 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim , and came unto the house of Micah .
18 : 20 And the priest ' s heart was glad , and he took the ephod , and the teraphim , and the graven image , and went in the midst of the people .
18 : 27 And they took the things which Micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
19 : 1 And it came to pass in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim , who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah .
19 : 3 And her husband arose , and went after her , to speak friendly unto her , and to bring her again , having his servant with him , and a couple of asses : and she brought him into her father ' s house : and when the father of the damsel saw him , he rejoiced to meet him .
19 : 5 And it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart : and the damsel ' s father said unto his son in law , Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way .
19 : 13 And he said unto his servant , Come , and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night , in Gibeah , or in Ramah .
and whence comest thou ?
19 : 24 Behold , here is my daughter a maiden , and his concubine ; them I will bring out now , and humble ye them , and do with them what seemeth good unto you : but unto this man do not so vile a thing .
19 : 25 But the men would not hearken to him : so the man took his concubine , and brought her forth unto them ; and they knew her , and abused her all the night until the morning : and when the day began to spring , they let her go .
19 : 27 And her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
20 : 4 And the Levite , the husband of the woman that was slain , answered and said , I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
20 : 13 Now therefore deliver us the men , the children of Belial , which are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel .
20 : 15 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword , beside the inhabitants of Gibeah , which were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
And the LORD said , Judah shall go up first .
20 : 19 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning , and encamped against Gibeah .
20 : 22 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
And the LORD said , Go up ; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand .
20 : 46 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword ; all these were men of valour .
And , behold , there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly .
21 : 10 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest , and commanded them , saying , Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the children .
21 : 18 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters : for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin .
21 : 23 And the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
1 : 4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they dwelled there about ten years .
are there yet any more sons in my womb , that they may be your husbands ?
nay , my daughters ; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me .
1 : 18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her , then she left speaking unto her .
2 : 8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth , Hearest thou not , my daughter ?
and when thou art athirst , go unto the vessels , and drink of that which the young men have drawn .
2 : 12 The LORD recompense thy work , and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel , under whose wings thou art come to trust .
2 : 14 And Boaz said unto her , At mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar .
And she sat beside the reapers : and he reached her parched corn , and she did eat , and was sufficed , and left .
2 : 17 So she gleaned in the field until even , and beat out that she had gleaned : and it was about an ephah of barley .
And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought , and said , The man ' s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz .
3 : 1 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her , My daughter , shall I not seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
3 : 9 And he said , Who art thou ?
4 : 5 Then said Boaz , What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi , thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance .
4 : 8 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz , Buy it for thee .
4 : 9 And Boaz said unto the elders , and unto all the people , Ye are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech ' s , and all that was Chilion ' s and Mahlon ' s , of the hand of Naomi .
4 : 13 So Boaz took Ruth , and she was his wife : and when he went in unto her , the LORD gave her conception , and she bare a son .
1 : 1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim , of mount Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephrathite : 1 : 2 And he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
1 : 9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk .
1 : 12 And it came to pass , as she continued praying before the LORD , that Eli marked her mouth .
1 : 17 Then Eli answered and said , Go in peace : and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him .
1 : 22 But Hannah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , I will not go up until the child be weaned , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the LORD , and there abide for ever .
2 : 8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill , to set them among princes , and to make them inherit the throne of glory : for the pillars of the earth are the LORD ' s , and he hath set the world upon them .
2 : 9 He will keep the feet of his saints , and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail .
2 : 15 Also before they burnt the fat , the priest ' s servant came , and said to the man that sacrificed , Give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
2 : 16 And if any man said unto him , Let them not fail to burn the fat presently , and then take as much as thy soul desireth ; then he would answer him , Nay ; but thou shalt give it me now : and if not , I will take it by force .
Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father , because the LORD would slay them .
and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel ?
2 : 33 And the man of thine , whom I shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume thine eyes , and to grieve thine heart : and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age .
2 : 35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
3 : 7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD , neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him .
And he arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou didst call me .
3 : 9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel , Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , Speak , LORD ; for thy servant heareth .
So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us , that , when it cometh among us , it may save us out of the hand of our enemies .
4 : 4 So the people sent to Shiloh , that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts , which dwelleth between the cherubims : and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the ark of the covenant of God .
4 : 6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews ?
4 : 9 Be strong and quit yourselves like men , O ye Philistines , that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews , as they have been to you : quit yourselves like men , and fight .
4 : 11 And the ark of God was taken ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were slain .
And when the man came into the city , and told it , all the city cried out .
And the man came in hastily , and told Eli .
5 : 4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD ; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold ; only the stump of Dagon was left to him .
6 : 1 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months .
6 : 3 And they said , If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel , send it not empty ; but in any wise return him a trespass offering : then ye shall be healed , and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you .
6 : 7 Now therefore make a new cart , and take two milch kine , on which there hath come no yoke , and tie the kine to the cart , and bring their calves home from them : 6 : 8 And take the ark of the LORD , and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jewels of gold , which ye return him for a trespass offering , in a coffer by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
6 : 9 And see , if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh , then he hath done us this great evil : but if not , then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us : it was a chance that happened to us .
6 : 15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD , and the coffer that was with it , wherein the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD .
7 : 2 And it came to pass , while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD .
And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh .
7 : 7 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel .
7 : 12 Then Samuel took a stone , and set it between Mizpeh and Shen , and called the name of it Ebenezer , saying , Hitherto hath the LORD helped us .
8 : 3 And his sons walked not in his ways , but turned aside after lucre , and took bribes , and perverted judgment .
9 : 1 Now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
9 : 5 And when they were come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
9 : 6 And he said unto him , Behold now , there is in this city a man of God , and he is an honourable man ; all that he saith cometh surely to pass : now let us go thither ; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go .
9 : 10 Then said Saul to his servant , Well said ; come , let us go .
9 : 17 And when Samuel saw Saul , the LORD said unto him , Behold the man whom I spake to thee of !
wherefore then speakest thou so to me ?
10 : 5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God , where is the garrison of the Philistines : and it shall come to pass , when thou art come thither to the city , that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery , and a tabret , and a pipe , and a harp , before them ; and they shall prophesy : 10 : 6 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them , and shalt be turned into another man .
10 : 7 And let it be , when these signs are come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for God is with thee .
10 : 9 And it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart : and all those signs came to pass that day .
10 : 12 And one of the same place answered and said , But who is their father ?
10 : 13 And when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place .
10 : 23 And they ran and fetched him thence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
10 : 24 And Samuel said to all the people , See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ?
And Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
10 : 26 And Saul also went home to Gibeah ; and there went with him a band of men , whose hearts God had touched .
11 : 10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said , To morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you .
11 : 12 And the people said unto Samuel , Who is he that said , Shall Saul reign over us ?
or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith ?
And they answered , He is witness .
12 : 9 And when they forgat the LORD their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
and , behold , the LORD hath set a king over you .
I will call unto the LORD , and he shall send thunder and rain ; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great , which ye have done in the sight of the LORD , in asking you a king .
12 : 20 And Samuel said unto the people , Fear not : ye have done all this wickedness : yet turn not aside from following the LORD , but serve the LORD with all your heart ; 12 : 21 And turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain things , which cannot profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
13 : 6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait , ( for the people were distressed ,) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
13 : 8 And he tarried seven days , according to the set time that Samuel had appointed : but Samuel came not to Gilgal ; and the people were scattered from him .
And Saul numbered the people that were present with him , about six hundred men .
13 : 22 So it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone .
14 : 8 Then said Jonathan , Behold , we will pass over unto these men , and we will discover ourselves unto them .
14 : 9 If they say thus unto us , Tarry until we come to you ; then we will stand still in our place , and will not go up unto them .
14 : 13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet , and his armourbearer after him : and they fell before Jonathan ; and his armourbearer slew after him .
14 : 14 And that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armourbearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a yoke of oxen might plow .
14 : 22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
14 : 25 And all they of the land came to a wood ; and there was honey upon the ground .
14 : 27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand , and dipped it in an honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines ?
14 : 33 Then they told Saul , saying , Behold , the people sin against the LORD , in that they eat with the blood .
And they said , Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee .
But he answered him not that day .
14 : 40 Then said he unto all Israel , Be ye on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side .
And Jonathan was taken .
14 : 43 Then Saul said to Jonathan , Tell me what thou hast done .
So the people rescued Jonathan , that he died not .
14 : 46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines : and the Philistines went to their own place .
15 : 20 And Saul said unto Samuel , Yea , I have obeyed the voice of the LORD , and have gone the way which the LORD sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
15 : 21 But the people took of the spoil , sheep and oxen , the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal .
15 : 26 And Samuel said unto Saul , I will not return with thee : for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD , and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel .
15 : 27 And as Samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
And Agag came unto him delicately .
15 : 34 Then Samuel went to Ramah ; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul .
fill thine horn with oil , and go , I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite : for I have provided me a king among his sons .
And he said , Neither hath the LORD chosen this .
16 : 17 And Saul said unto his servants , Provide me now a man that can play well , and bring him to me .
16 : 18 Then answered one of the servants , and said , Behold , I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite , that is cunning in playing , and a mighty valiant man , and a man of war , and prudent in matters , and a comely person , and the LORD is with him .
16 : 19 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse , and said , Send me David thy son , which is with the sheep .
17 : 2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and pitched by the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
17 : 8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel , and said unto them , Why are ye come out to set your battle in array ?
17 : 13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next unto him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
17 : 15 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father ' s sheep at Bethlehem .
17 : 19 Now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
17 : 37 David said moreover , The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine .
And the Philistine cursed David by his gods .
17 : 51 Therefore David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith .
18 : 4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his garments , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
18 : 13 Therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
For Saul said , Let not mine hand be upon him , but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him .
18 : 21 And Saul said , I will give him her , that she may be a snare to him , and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him .
Wherefore Saul said to David , Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain .
19 : 4 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father , and said unto him , Let not the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he hath not sinned against thee , and because his works have been to thee - ward very good : 19 : 5 For he did put his life in his hand , and slew the Philistine , and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel : thou sawest it , and didst rejoice : wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood , to slay David without a cause ?
19 : 7 And Jonathan called David , and Jonathan shewed him all those things .
19 : 16 And when the messengers were come in , behold , there was an image in the bed , with a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster .
20 : 4 Then said Jonathan unto David , Whatsoever thy soul desireth , I will even do it for thee .
or what if thy father answer thee roughly ?
20 : 12 And Jonathan said unto David , O LORD God of Israel , when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time , or the third day , and , behold , if there be good toward David , and I then send not unto thee , and shew it thee ; 20 : 13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan : but if it please my father to do thee evil , then I will shew it thee , and send thee away , that thou mayest go in peace : and the LORD be with thee , as he hath been with my father .
20 : 17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again , because he loved him : for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
If I expressly say unto the lad , Behold , the arrows are on this side of thee , take them ; then come thou : for there is peace to thee , and no hurt ; as the LORD liveth .
20 : 22 But if I say thus unto the young man , Behold , the arrows are beyond thee ; go thy way : for the LORD hath sent thee away .
Therefore he cometh not unto the king ' s table .
20 : 34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
20 : 39 But the lad knew not any thing : only Jonathan and David knew the matter .
did they not sing one to another of him in dances , saying , Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
shall this fellow come into my house ?
22 : 1 David therefore departed thence , and escaped to the cave Adullam : and when his brethren and all his father ' s house heard it , they went down thither to him .
22 : 12 And Saul said , Hear now , thou son of Ahitub .
22 : 14 Then Ahimelech answered the king , and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , which is the king ' s son in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and is honourable in thine house ?
22 : 21 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD ' s priests .
23 : 6 And it came to pass , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
23 : 7 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah .
23 : 11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand ?
And the LORD said , They will deliver thee up .
23 : 19 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah , saying , Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
23 : 23 See therefore , and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself , and come ye again to me with the certainty , and I will go with you : and it shall come to pass , if he be in the land , that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah .
23 : 24 And they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the plain on the south of Jeshimon .
24 : 4 And the men of David said unto him , Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee , Behold , I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand , that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee .
Then David arose , and cut off the skirt of Saul ' s robe privily .
24 : 5 And it came to pass afterward , that David ' s heart smote him , because he had cut off Saul ' s skirt .
24 : 17 And he said to David , Thou art more righteous than I : for thou hast rewarded me good , whereas I have rewarded thee evil .
24 : 18 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me : forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand , thou killedst me not .
24 : 19 For if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ?
25 : 3 Now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
25 : 7 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers : now thy shepherds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing unto them , all the while they were in Carmel .
25 : 8 Ask thy young men , and they will shew thee .
25 : 20 And it was so , as she rode on the ass , that she came down by the covert on the hill , and , behold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
But David abode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
26 : 6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite , and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah , brother to Joab , saying , Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ?
26 : 10 David said furthermore , As the LORD liveth , the LORD shall smite him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall descend into battle , and perish .
for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord .
26 : 18 And he said , Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant ?
or what evil is in mine hand ?
26 : 24 And , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
27 : 4 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath : and he sought no more again for him .
27 : 9 And David smote the land , and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the oxen , and the asses , and the camels , and the apparel , and returned , and came to Achish .
27 : 10 And Achish said , Whither have ye made a road to day ?
28 : 6 And when Saul enquired of the LORD , the LORD answered him not , neither by dreams , nor by Urim , nor by prophets .
And his servants said to him , Behold , there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor .
28 : 23 But he refused , and said , I will not eat .
But his servants , together with the woman , compelled him ; and he hearkened unto their voice .
29 : 3 Then said the princes of the Philistines , What do these Hebrews here ?
should it not be with the heads of these men ?
30 : 13 And David said unto him , To whom belongest thou ?
And he said , Swear unto me by God , that thou wilt neither kill me , nor deliver me into the hands of my master , and I will bring thee down to this company .
30 : 16 And when he had brought him down , behold , they were spread abroad upon all the earth , eating and drinking , and dancing , because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines , and out of the land of Judah .
30 : 22 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial , of those that went with David , and said , Because they went not with us , we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered , save to every man his wife and his children , that they may lead them away , and depart .
The Second Book of Samuel
1 : 17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son : 1 : 18 ( Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jasher .)
1 : 19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places : how are the mighty fallen !
O Jonathan , thou wast slain in thine high places .
And the LORD said unto him , Go up .
2 : 3 And his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
2 : 13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out , and met together by the pool of Gibeon : and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
2 : 14 And Abner said to Joab , Let the young men now arise , and play before us .
2 : 29 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and they came to Mahanaim .
2 : 30 And Joab returned from following Abner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David ' s servants nineteen men and Asahel .
3 : 1 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : but David waxed stronger and stronger , and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker .
3 : 25 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive thee , and to know thy going out and thy coming in , and to know all that thou doest .
3 : 30 So Joab , and Abishai his brother slew Abner , because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle .
3 : 39 And I am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me : the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness .
4 : 2 And Saul ' s son had two men that were captains of bands : the name of the one was Baanah , and the name of the other Rechab , the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite , of the children of Benjamin : ( for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin .
4 : 8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron , and said to the king , Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy , which sought thy life ; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul , and of his seed .
4 : 12 And David commanded his young men , and they slew them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron .
5 : 9 So David dwelt in the fort , and called it the city of David .
5 : 12 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel ' s sake .
5 : 19 And David enquired of the LORD , saying , Shall I go up to the Philistines ?
5 : 21 And there they left their images , and David and his men burned them .
6 : 3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness .
6 : 14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might ; and David was girded with a linen ephod .
6 : 18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts .
So all the people departed every one to his house .
7 : 17 According to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak unto David .
And is this the manner of man , O Lord GOD ?
8 : 8 And from Betah , and from Berothai , cities of Hadadezer , king David took exceeding much brass .
8 : 15 And David reigned over all Israel ; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people .
9 : 1 And David said , Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul , that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan ' s sake ?
And Ziba said unto the king , Behold , he is in the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , in Lodebar .
10 : 2 Then said David , I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash , as his father shewed kindness unto me .
And David ' s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon .
10 : 3 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord , Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father , that he hath sent comforters unto thee ?
10 : 7 And when David heard of it , he sent Joab , and all the host of the mighty men .
But David tarried still at Jerusalem .
And Joab sent Uriah to David .
11 : 12 And David said to Uriah , Tarry here to day also , and to morrow I will let thee depart .
So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day , and the morrow .
11 : 23 And the messenger said unto David , Surely the men prevailed against us , and came out unto us into the field , and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate .
12 : 1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David .
And he came unto him , and said unto him , There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I anointed thee king over Israel , and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul ; 12 : 8 And I gave thee thy master ' s house , and thy master ' s wives into thy bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
12 : 14 Howbeit , because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme , the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die .
And the LORD struck the child that Uriah ' s wife bare unto David , and it was very sick .
thou didst fast and weep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
I shall go to him , but he shall not return to me .
12 : 31 And he brought forth the people that were therein , and put them under saws , and under harrows of iron , and under axes of iron , and made them pass through the brick - kiln : and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon .
13 : 4 And he said unto him , Why art thou , being the king ' s son , lean from day to day ?
13 : 6 So Amnon lay down , and made himself sick : and when the king was come to see him , Amnon said unto the king , I pray thee , let Tamar my sister come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
13 : 8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon ' s house ; and he was laid down .
13 : 9 And she took a pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat .
13 : 14 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice : but , being stronger than she , forced her , and lay with her .
13 : 15 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly ; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her .
14 : 17 Then thine handmaid said , The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad : therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee .
14 : 24 And the king said , Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face .
So Absalom returned to his own house , and saw not the king ' s face .
14 : 27 And unto Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a fair countenance .
14 : 33 So Joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
15 : 2 And Absalom rose up early , and stood beside the way of the gate : and it was so , that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment , then Absalom called unto him , and said , Of what city art thou ?
15 : 5 And it was so , that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and kissed him .
15 : 6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
15 : 8 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria , saying , If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem , then I will serve the LORD .
15 : 16 And the king went forth , and all his household after him .
15 : 17 And the king went forth , and all the people after him , and tarried in a place that was far off .
15 : 25 And the king said unto Zadok , Carry back the ark of God into the city : if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD , he will bring me again , and shew me both it , and his habitation : 15 : 26 But if he thus say , I have no delight in thee ; behold , here am I , let him do to me as seemeth good unto him .
16 : 4 Then said the king to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth .
16 : 17 And Absalom said to Hushai , Is this thy kindness to thy friend ?
17 : 1 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom , Let me now choose out twelve thousand men , and I will arise and pursue after David this night : 17 : 2 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will smite the king only : 17 : 3 And I will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned : so all the people shall be in peace .
17 : 4 And the saying pleased Absalom well , and all the elders of Israel .
For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom .
18 : 13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life : for there is no matter hid from the king , and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me .
18 : 15 And ten young men that bare Joab ' s armour compassed about and smote Absalom , and slew him .
18 : 20 And Joab said unto him , Thou shalt not bear tidings this day , but thou shalt bear tidings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no tidings , because the king ' s son is dead .
18 : 22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab , But howsoever , let me , I pray thee , also run after Cushi .
God do so to me , and more also , if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab .
19 : 18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king ' s household , and to do what he thought good .
19 : 22 And David said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah , that ye should this day be adversaries unto me ?
I have said , Thou and Ziba divide the land .
19 : 33 And the king said unto Barzillai , Come thou over with me , and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem .
So they were shut up unto the day of their death , living in widowhood .
20 : 6 And David said to Abishai , Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom : take thou thy lord ' s servants , and pursue after him , lest he get him fenced cities , and escape us .
20 : 8 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon , Amasa went before them .
And Joab ' s garment that he had put on was girded unto him , and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof ; and as he went forth it fell out .
And when the man saw that all the people stood still , he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field , and cast a cloth upon him , when he saw that every one that came by him stood still .
20 : 13 When he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
20 : 16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city , Hear , hear ; say , I pray you , unto Joab , Come near hither , that I may speak with thee .
21 : 1 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years , year after year ; and David enquired of the LORD .
21 : 17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him , and smote the Philistine , and killed him .
21 : 19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines , where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim , a Bethlehemite , slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver ' s beam .
22 : 1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul : 22 : 2 And he said , The LORD is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; 22 : 3 The God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest me from violence .
22 : 4 I will call on the LORD , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
22 : 32 For who is God , save the LORD ?
22 : 38 I have pursued mine enemies , and destroyed them ; and turned not again until I had consumed them .
22 : 42 They looked , but there was none to save ; even unto the LORD , but he answered them not .
23 : 6 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away , because they cannot be taken with hands : 23 : 7 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear ; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place .
And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
23 : 15 And David longed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate !
23 : 16 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the LORD .
therefore he would not drink it .
24 : 15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed : and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men .
The First Book of the Kings
and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom .
1 : 15 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber : and the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king .
And the king said , What wouldest thou ?
1 : 28 Then king David answered and said , Call me Bathsheba .
And she came into the king ' s presence , and stood before the king .
And they came before the king .
1 : 39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anointed Solomon .
2 : 6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom , and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace .
2 : 8 And , behold , thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera , a Benjamite of Bahurim , which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim : but he came down to meet me at Jordan , and I sware to him by the LORD , saying , I will not put thee to death with the sword .
2 : 10 So David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David .
2 : 25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he fell upon him that he died .
And they told Shimei , saying , Behold , thy servants be in Gath .
2 : 41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath , and was come again .
2 : 42 And the king sent and called for Shimei , and said unto him , Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD , and protested unto thee , saying , Know for a certain , on the day thou goest out , and walkest abroad any whither , that thou shalt surely die ?
3 : 2 Only the people sacrificed in high places , because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD , until those days .
3 : 16 Then came there two women , that were harlots , unto the king , and stood before him .
3 : 20 And she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while thine handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
3 : 21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck , behold , it was dead : but when I had considered it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , which I did bear .
3 : 24 And the king said , Bring me a sword .
3 : 28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king : for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him , to do judgment .
4 : 31 For he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Chalcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was in all nations round about .
4 : 32 And he spake three thousand proverbs : and his songs were a thousand and five .
5 : 1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father : for Hiram was ever a lover of David .
5 : 8 And Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for : and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
5 : 18 And Solomon ' s builders and Hiram ' s builders did hew them , and the stonesquarers : so they prepared timber and stones to build the house .
6 : 4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights .
6 : 8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
6 : 11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon , saying , 6 : 12 Concerning this house which thou art in building , if thou wilt walk in my statutes , and execute my judgments , and keep all my commandments to walk in them ; then will I perform my word with thee , which I spake unto David thy father : 6 : 13 And I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will not forsake my people Israel .
6 : 16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house , both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar : he even built them for it within , even for the oracle , even for the most holy place .
6 : 20 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
6 : 32 The two doors also were of olive tree ; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold , and spread gold upon the cherubims , and upon the palm trees .
7 : 1 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years , and he finished all his house .
7 : 3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams , that lay on forty five pillars , fifteen in a row .
7 : 5 And all the doors and posts were square , with the windows : and light was against light in three ranks .
7 : 8 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work .
7 : 11 And above were costly stones , after the measures of hewed stones , and cedars .
7 : 15 For he cast two pillars of brass , of eighteen cubits high apiece : and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about .
7 : 30 And every base had four brasen wheels , and plates of brass : and the four corners thereof had undersetters : under the laver were undersetters molten , at the side of every addition .
So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD : 7 : 41 The two pillars , and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars ; and the two networks , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ; 7 : 42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , even two rows of pomegranates for one network , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars ; 7 : 43 And the ten bases , and ten lavers on the bases ; 7 : 44 And one sea , and twelve oxen under the sea ; 7 : 45 And the pots , and the shovels , and the basons : and all these vessels , which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD , were of bright brass .
7 : 48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread was , 7 : 49 And the candlesticks of pure gold , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , with the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs of gold , 7 : 50 And the bowls , and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , to wit , of the temple .
8 : 4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , even those did the priests and the Levites bring up .
8 : 8 And they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
8 : 13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in , a settled place for thee to abide in for ever .
8 : 27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth ?
8 : 35 When heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , when thou afflictest them : 8 : 36 Then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
8 : 41 Moreover concerning a stranger , that is not of thy people Israel , but cometh out of a far country for thy name ' s sake ; 8 : 42 ( For they shall hear of thy great name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretched out arm ;) when he shall come and pray toward this house ; 8 : 43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for : that all people of the earth may know thy name , to fear thee , as do thy people Israel ; and that they may know that this house , which I have builded , is called by thy name .
8 : 46 If they sin against thee , ( for there is no man that sinneth not ,) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy , far or near ; 8 : 47 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives , saying , We have sinned , and have done perversely , we have committed wickedness ; 8 : 48 And so return unto thee with all their heart , and with all their soul , in the land of their enemies , which led them away captive , and pray unto thee toward their land , which thou gavest unto their fathers , the city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for thy name : 8 : 49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place , and maintain their cause , 8 : 50 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee , and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee , and give them compassion before them who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them : 8 : 51 For they be thy people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron : 8 : 52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant , and unto the supplication of thy people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
8 : 54 And it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD , he arose from before the altar of the LORD , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven .
8 : 62 And the king , and all Israel with him , offered sacrifice before the LORD .
9 : 12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they pleased him not .
9 : 13 And he said , What cities are these which thou hast given me , my brother ?
So he finished the house .
10 : 3 And Solomon told her all her questions : there was not any thing hid from the king , which he told her not .
10 : 8 Happy are thy men , happy are these thy servants , which stand continually before thee , and that hear thy wisdom .
10 : 13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty .
10 : 24 And all the earth sought to Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
And he answered , Nothing : howbeit let me go in any wise .
12 : 6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men , that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , and said , How do ye advise that I may answer this people ?
12 : 8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him : 12 : 9 And he said unto them , What counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter ?
12 : 11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father hath chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
12 : 16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them , the people answered the king , saying , What portion have we in David ?
neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse : to your tents , O Israel : now see to thine own house , David .
12 : 33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart ; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel : and he offered upon the altar , and burnt incense .
And the man of God besought the LORD , and the king ' s hand was restored him again , and became as it was before .
13 : 11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
14 : 16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , who did sin , and who made Israel to sin .
14 : 21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah .
And his mother ' s name was Naamah an Ammonitess .
15 : 2 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
And his mother ' s name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
15 : 13 And also Maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and Asa destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the brook Kidron .
15 : 17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
15 : 28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him , and reigned in his stead .
16 : 5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
16 : 23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel , twelve years : six years reigned he in Tirzah .
16 : 25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD , and did worse than all that were before him .
16 : 26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin , to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
17 : 11 And as she was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , Bring me , I pray thee , a morsel of bread in thine hand .
17 : 15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , did eat many days .
17 : 16 And the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake by Elijah .
17 : 17 And it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so sore , that there was no breath left in him .
And he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into a loft , where he abode , and laid him upon his own bed .
17 : 22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
18 : 10 As the LORD thy God liveth , there is no nation or kingdom , whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee : and when they said , He is not there ; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation , that they found thee not .
18 : 12 And it shall come to pass , as soon as I am gone from thee , that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not ; and so when I come and tell Ahab , and he cannot find thee , he shall slay me : but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth .
And all the people answered and said , It is well spoken .
18 : 29 And it came to pass , when midday was past , and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
18 : 39 And when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces : and they said , The LORD , he is the God ; the LORD , he is the God .
19 : 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah , saying , So let the gods do to me , and more also , if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time .
19 : 21 And he returned back from him , and took a yoke of oxen , and slew them , and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen , and gave unto the people , and they did eat .
20 : 1 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and horses , and chariots ; and he went up and besieged Samaria , and warred against it .
20 : 5 And the messengers came again , and said , Thus speaketh Benhadad , saying , Although I have sent unto thee , saying , Thou shalt deliver me thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wives , and thy children ; 20 : 6 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time , and they shall search thine house , and the houses of thy servants ; and it shall be , that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
20 : 7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land , and said , Mark , I pray you , and see how this man seeketh mischief : for he sent unto me for my wives , and for my children , and for my silver , and for my gold ; and I denied him not .
20 : 13 And , behold , there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel , saying , Thus saith the LORD , Hast thou seen all this great multitude ?
But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty and two kings that helped him .
20 : 18 And he said , Whether they be come out for peace , take them alive ; or whether they be come out for war , take them alive .
21 : 1 And it came to pass after these things , that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard , which was in Jezreel , hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria .
21 : 4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him : for he had said , I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers .
And he laid him down upon his bed , and turned away his face , and would eat no bread .
21 : 12 They proclaimed a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people .
And he answered , I have found thee : because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD .
21 : 23 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD , saying , The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel .
because he humbleth himself before me , I will not bring the evil in his days : but in his son ' s days will I bring the evil upon his house .
22 : 11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron : and he said , Thus saith the LORD , With these shalt thou push the Syrians , until thou have consumed them .
22 : 25 And Micaiah said , Behold , thou shalt see in that day , when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself .
22 : 29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead .
And they turned aside to fight against him : and Jehoshaphat cried out .
22 : 33 And it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
22 : 36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun , saying , Every man to his city , and every man to his own country .
And his mother ' s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
And Elijah departed .
And he said , It is Elijah the Tishbite .

And they two went on .
And they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
And he said , Ye shall not send .
2 : 22 So the waters were healed unto this day , according to the saying of Elisha which he spake .
3 : 7 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , saying , The king of Moab hath rebelled against me : wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle ?
And he said , I will go up : I am as thou art , my people as thy people , and my horses as thy horses .
3 : 8 And he said , Which way shall we go up ?
And he answered , The way through the wilderness of Edom .
get thee to the prophets of thy father , and to the prophets of thy mother .
3 : 18 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD : he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand .
3 : 22 And they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood : 3 : 23 And they said , This is blood : the kings are surely slain , and they have smitten one another : now therefore , Moab , to the spoil .
4 : 8 And it fell on a day , that Elisha passed to Shunem , where was a great woman ; and she constrained him to eat bread .
4 : 28 Then she said , Did I desire a son of my lord ?

And there was no harm in the pot .
4 : 42 And there came a man from Baalshalisha , and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits , twenty loaves of barley , and full ears of corn in the husk thereof .
5 : 1 Now Naaman , captain of the host of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honourable , because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria : he was also a mighty man in valour , but he was a leper .
wherefore consider , I pray you , and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me .
let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
5 : 16 But he said , As the LORD liveth , before whom I stand , I will receive none .
5 : 19 And he said unto him , Go in peace .
And he said , Thy servant went no whither .
5 : 27 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee , and unto thy seed for ever .
how shall we do ?
6 : 17 And Elisha prayed , and said , LORD , I pray thee , open his eyes , that he may see .
6 : 19 And Elisha said unto them , This is not the way , neither is this the city : follow me , and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek .
6 : 20 And it came to pass , when they were come into Samaria , that Elisha said , LORD , open the eyes of these men , that they may see .
set bread and water before them , that they may eat and drink , and go to their master .
6 : 24 And it came to pass after this , that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host , and went up , and besieged Samaria .
6 : 27 And he said , If the LORD do not help thee , whence shall I help thee ?
out of the barnfloor , or out of the winepress ?
6 : 29 So we boiled my son , and did eat him : and I said unto her on the next day , Give thy son , that we may eat him : and she hath hid her son .
6 : 33 And while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him : and he said , Behold , this evil is of the LORD ; what should I wait for the LORD any longer ?
7 : 7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
7 : 10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city : and they told them , saying , We came to the camp of the Syrians , and , behold , there was no man there , neither voice of man , but horses tied , and asses tied , and the tents as they were .
7 : 17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate : and the people trode upon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of God had said , who spake when the king came down to him .

And his mother ' s name was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
9 : 4 So the young man , even the young man the prophet , went to Ramothgilead .
9 : 13 Then they hasted , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew with trumpets , saying , Jehu is king .
And Jehu said , If it be your minds , then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel .
turn thee behind me .
9 : 21 And Joram said , Make ready .
9 : 25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain , Take up , and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite : for remember how that , when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father , the LORD laid this burden upon him ; 9 : 26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth , and the blood of his sons , saith the LORD ; and I will requite thee in this plat , saith the LORD .
And Jehu followed after him , and said , Smite him also in the chariot .
And he fled to Megiddo , and died there .
9 : 29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah .
9 : 33 And he said , Throw her down .
10 : 4 But they were exceedingly afraid , and said , Behold , two kings stood not before him : how then shall we stand ?
10 : 5 And he that was over the house , and he that was over the city , the elders also , and the bringers up of the children , sent to Jehu , saying , We are thy servants , and will do all that thou shalt bid us ; we will not make any king : do thou that which is good in thine eyes .
And he said , Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning .
10 : 17 And when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the LORD , which he spake to Elijah .
10 : 19 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal , all his servants , and all his priests ; let none be wanting : for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal ; whosoever shall be wanting , he shall not live .
10 : 22 And he said unto him that was over the vestry , Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal .
10 : 25 And it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains , Go in , and slay them ; let none come forth .
11 : 10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David ' s spears and shields , that were in the temple of the LORD .
And he sat on the throne of the kings .
And his mother ' s name was Zibiah of Beersheba .
12 : 7 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ?
12 : 8 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people , neither to repair the breaches of the house .
12 : 21 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad the son of Shomer , his servants , smote him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
13 : 5 ( And the LORD gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
13 : 11 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD ; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel sin : but he walked therein .
13 : 12 And the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
13 : 17 And he said , Open the window eastward .
And he took them .
And he smote thrice , and stayed .
And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
13 : 22 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz .
14 : 1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah .
Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
14 : 20 And they brought him on horses : and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David .
14 : 21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah , which was sixteen years old , and made him king instead of his father Amaziah .
15 : 5 And the LORD smote the king , so that he was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house .
15 : 18 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
So the king of Assyria turned back , and stayed not there in the land .
15 : 27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned twenty years .
15 : 38 And Jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
16 : 1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign .
16 : 14 And he brought also the brasen altar , which was before the LORD , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the LORD , and put it on the north side of the altar .
17 : 20 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
17 : 26 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria , saying , The nations which thou hast removed , and placed in the cities of Samaria , know not the manner of the God of the land : therefore he hath sent lions among them , and , behold , they slay them , because they know not the manner of the God of the land .
17 : 32 So they feared the LORD , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
18 : 3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that David his father did .
18 : 11 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria , and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes : 18 : 12 Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God , but transgressed his covenant , and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded , and would not hear them , nor do them .
18 : 15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD , and in the treasures of the king ' s house .
18 : 17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem .
18 : 18 And when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
18 : 19 And Rabshakeh said unto them , Speak ye now to Hezekiah , Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria , What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
18 : 21 Now , behold , thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and pierce it : so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him .
18 : 24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master ' s servants , and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
18 : 31 Hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus saith the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eat ye every man of his own vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern : 18 : 32 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of oil olive and of honey , that ye may live , and not die : and hearken not unto Hezekiah , when he persuadeth you , saying , The LORD will deliver us .
19 : 7 Behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
19 : 13 Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivah ?
19 : 24 I have digged and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places .
19 : 25 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ?
19 : 33 By the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the LORD .
And Hezekiah wept sore .
20 : 12 At that time Berodachbaladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah : for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
and from whence came they unto thee ?
And he said , Is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ?
20 : 21 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers : and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
21 : 4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD , of which the LORD said , In Jerusalem will I put my name .
21 : 9 But they hearkened not : and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel .
And his mother ' s name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
21 : 24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
22 : 10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king , saying , Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book .
And Shaphan read it before the king .
22 : 20 Behold therefore , I will gather thee unto thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place .
23 : 12 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD , did the king beat down , and brake them down from thence , and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron .
23 : 15 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel , and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , had made , both that altar and the high place he brake down , and burned the high place , and stamped it small to powder , and burned the grove .
23 : 26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath , wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal .
23 : 34 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father , and turned his name to Jehoiakim , and took Jehoahaz away : and he came to Egypt , and died there .
24 : 9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father had done .
24 : 12 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
24 : 13 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD , and the treasures of the king ' s house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD , as the LORD had said .
24 : 16 And all the men of might , even seven thousand , and craftsmen and smiths a thousand , all that were strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
24 : 18 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem .
24 : 19 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
25 : 4 And the city was broken up , and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls , which is by the king ' s garden : ( now the Chaldees were against the city round about :) and the king went the way toward the plain .
25 : 11 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away .
25 : 12 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen .
25 : 25 But it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah .
25 : 26 And all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the armies , arose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chaldees .
25 : 27 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison ; 25 : 28 And he spake kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon ; 25 : 29 And changed his prison garments : and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life .

10 : 13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD , even against the word of the LORD , which he kept not , and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit , to enquire of it ; 10 : 14 And enquired not of the LORD : therefore he slew him , and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse .

11 : 26 Also the valiant men of the armies were , Asahel the brother of Joab , Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem , 11 : 27 Shammoth the Harorite , Helez the Pelonite , 11 : 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite , Abiezer the Antothite , 11 : 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite , Ilai the Ahohite , 11 : 30 Maharai the Netophathite , Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite , 11 : 31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah , that pertained to the children of Benjamin , Benaiah the Pirathonite , 11 : 32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash , Abiel the Arbathite , 11 : 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite , Eliahba the Shaalbonite , 11 : 34 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite , Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite , 11 : 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite , Eliphal the son of Ur , 11 : 36 Hepher the Mecherathite , Ahijah the Pelonite , 11 : 37 Hezro the Carmelite , Naarai the son of Ezbai , 11 : 38 Joel the brother of Nathan , Mibhar the son of Haggeri , 11 : 39 Zelek the Ammonite , Naharai the Berothite , the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah , 11 : 40 Ira the Ithrite , Gareb the Ithrite , 11 : 41 Uriah the Hittite , Zabad the son of Ahlai , 11 : 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite , a captain of the Reubenites , and thirty with him , 11 : 43 Hanan the son of Maachah , and Joshaphat the Mithnite , 11 : 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite , Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite , 11 : 45 Jediael the son of Shimri , and Joha his brother , the Tizite , 11 : 46 Eliel the Mahavite , and Jeribai , and Joshaviah , the sons of Elnaam , and Ithmah the Moabite , 11 : 47 Eliel , and Obed , and Jasiel the Mesobaite .
12 : 16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David .
12 : 18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai , who was chief of the captains , and he said , Thine are we , David , and on thy side , thou son of Jesse : peace , peace be unto thee , and peace be to thine helpers ; for thy God helpeth thee .
13 : 5 So David gathered all Israel together , from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath , to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim .
13 : 7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart .
14 : 2 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel , for his kingdom was lifted up on high , because of his people Israel .
And the LORD said unto him , Go up ; for I will deliver them into thine hand .
14 : 17 And the fame of David went out into all lands ; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations .
15 : 3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem , to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place , which he had prepared for it .
15 : 4 And David assembled the children of Aaron , and the Levites : 15 : 5 Of the sons of Kohath ; Uriel the chief , and his brethren an hundred and twenty : 15 : 6 Of the sons of Merari ; Asaiah the chief , and his brethren two hundred and twenty : 15 : 7 Of the sons of Gershom ; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty : 15 : 8 Of the sons of Elizaphan ; Shemaiah the chief , and his brethren two hundred : 15 : 9 Of the sons of Hebron ; Eliel the chief , and his brethren fourscore : 15 : 10 Of the sons of Uzziel ; Amminadab the chief , and his brethren an hundred and twelve .
15 : 11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests , and for the Levites , for Uriel , Asaiah , and Joel , Shemaiah , and Eliel , and Amminadab , 15 : 12 And said unto them , Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites : sanctify yourselves , both ye and your brethren , that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it .
15 : 23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark .
16 : 20 And when they went from nation to nation , and from one kingdom to another people ; 16 : 21 He suffered no man to do them wrong : yea , he reproved kings for their sakes , 16 : 22 Saying , Touch not mine anointed , and do my prophets no harm .
16 : 26 For all the gods of the people are idols : but the LORD made the heavens .
16 : 37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren , to minister before the ark continually , as every day ' s work required : 16 : 38 And Obededom with their brethren , threescore and eight ; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters : 16 : 39 And Zadok the priest , and his brethren the priests , before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon , 16 : 40 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD , which he commanded Israel ; 16 : 41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the LORD , because his mercy endureth for ever ; 16 : 42 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound , and with musical instruments of God .
17 : 7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , I took thee from the sheepcote , even from following the sheep , that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel : 17 : 8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
17 : 11 And it shall come to pass , when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers , that I will raise up thy seed after thee , which shall be of thy sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
17 : 13 I will be his father , and he shall be my son : and I will not take my mercy away from him , as I took it from him that was before thee : 17 : 14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever : and his throne shall be established for evermore .
17 : 17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes , O God ; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant ' s house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O LORD God .
17 : 21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel , whom God went to redeem to be his own people , to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness , by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt ?
17 : 26 And now , LORD , thou art God , and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant : 17 : 27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may be before thee for ever : for thou blessest , O LORD , and it shall be blessed for ever .
18 : 6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus ; and the Syrians became David ' s servants , and brought gifts .
18 : 16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ; 18 : 17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were chief about the king .
19 : 2 And David said , I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash , because his father shewed kindness to me .
And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father .
And he sent to meet them : for the men were greatly ashamed .
19 : 7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots , and the king of Maachah and his people ; who came and pitched before Medeba .
19 : 10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
19 : 13 Be of good courage , and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people , and for the cities of our God : and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight .
19 : 15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city .
19 : 17 And it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel , and passed over Jordan , and came upon them , and set the battle in array against them .
19 : 18 But the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots , and forty thousand footmen , and killed Shophach the captain of the host .
19 : 19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they made peace with David , and became his servants : neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more .
But David tarried at Jerusalem .
20 : 3 And he brought out the people that were in it , and cut them with saws , and with harrows of iron , and with axes .
21 : 3 And Joab answered , The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be : but , my lord the king , are they not all my lord ' s servants ?
why then doth my lord require this thing ?
21 : 7 And God was displeased with this thing ; therefore he smote Israel .
21 : 9 And the LORD spake unto Gad , David ' s seer , saying , 21 : 10 Go and tell David , saying , Thus saith the LORD , I offer thee three things : choose thee one of them , that I may do it unto thee .
21 : 14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel : and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men .
even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed ; but as for these sheep , what have they done ?
21 : 18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
21 : 30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God : for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD .
22 : 6 Then he called for Solomon his son , and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel .
22 : 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God ; arise therefore , and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God , to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and the holy vessels of God , into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD .
23 : 7 Of the Gershonites were , Laadan , and Shimei .
24 : 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father , and had no children : therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest ' s office .
24 : 19 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD , according to their manner , under Aaron their father , as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him .
24 : 21 Concerning Rehabiah : of the sons of Rehabiah , the first was Isshiah .
24 : 22 Of the Izharites ; Shelomoth : of the sons of Shelomoth ; Jahath .
25 : 1 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with psalteries , and with cymbals : and the number of the workmen according to their service was : 25 : 2 Of the sons of Asaph ; Zaccur , and Joseph , and Nethaniah , and Asarelah , the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph , which prophesied according to the order of the king .
26 : 2 And the sons of Meshelemiah were , Zechariah the firstborn , Jediael the second , Zebadiah the third , Jathniel the fourth , 26 : 3 Elam the fifth , Jehohanan the sixth , Elioenai the seventh .
26 : 6 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were mighty men of valour .
26 : 26 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fathers , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the host , had dedicated .
27 : 3 Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month .
27 : 13 The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite , of the Zarhites : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
27 : 14 The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
28 : 1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel , the princes of the tribes , and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course , and the captains over the thousands , and captains over the hundreds , and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king , and of his sons , with the officers , and with the mighty men , and with all the valiant men , unto Jerusalem .
28 : 9 And thou , Solomon my son , know thou the God of thy father , and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind : for the LORD searcheth all hearts , and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts : if thou seek him , he will be found of thee ; but if thou forsake him , he will cast thee off for ever .
28 : 10 Take heed now ; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary : be strong , and do it .
29 : 4 Even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , to overlay the walls of the houses withal : 29 : 5 The gold for things of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers .
As for me , in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things : and now have I seen with joy thy people , which are present here , to offer willingly unto thee .
29 : 24 And all the princes , and the mighty men , and all the sons likewise of king David , submitted themselves unto Solomon the king .
The Second Book of the Chronicles
1 : 13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the congregation , and reigned over Israel .
3 : 9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold .
4 : 2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubits the height thereof ; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
4 : 6 He made also ten lavers , and put five on the right hand , and five on the left , to wash in them : such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them ; but the sea was for the priests to wash in .
4 : 7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
4 : 8 He made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left .
5 : 3 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month .
5 : 7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place , to the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims : 5 : 8 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above .
5 : 10 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb , when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
6 : 3 And the king turned his face , and blessed the whole congregation of Israel : and all the congregation of Israel stood .
6 : 17 Now then , O LORD God of Israel , let thy word be verified , which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David .
6 : 19 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , O LORD my God , to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee : 6 : 20 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there ; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place .
6 : 32 Moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of thy people Israel , but is come from a far country for thy great name ' s sake , and thy mighty hand , and thy stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ; 6 : 33 Then hear thou from the heavens , even from thy dwelling place , and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for ; that all people of the earth may know thy name , and fear thee , as doth thy people Israel , and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name .
6 : 42 O LORD God , turn not away the face of thine anointed : remember the mercies of David thy servant .
7 : 2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD , because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD ' s house .
8 : 3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah , and prevailed against it .
8 : 15 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
9 : 2 And Solomon told her all her questions : and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not .
9 : 10 And the servants also of Huram , and the servants of Solomon , which brought gold from Ophir , brought algum trees and precious stones .
9 : 30 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years .
10 : 1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem : for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king .
10 : 17 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
11 : 2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God , saying , 11 : 3 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin , saying , 11 : 4 Thus saith the LORD , Ye shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me .
11 : 16 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers .
11 : 17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong , three years : for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon .
11 : 21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and threescore concubines ; and begat twenty and eight sons , and threescore daughters .)
11 : 22 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief , to be ruler among his brethren : for he thought to make him king .
12 : 5 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam , and to the princes of Judah , that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said unto them , Thus saith the LORD , Ye have forsaken me , and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak .
13 : 1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah .
13 : 2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem .
His mother ' s name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah .
13 : 4 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim , which is in mount Ephraim , and said , Hear me , thou Jeroboam , and all Israel ; 13 : 5 Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
13 : 6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
13 : 7 And there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Belial , and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them .
13 : 15 Then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it came to pass , that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
13 : 21 But Abijah waxed mighty , and married fourteen wives , and begat twenty and two sons , and sixteen daughters .
14 : 1 So Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and Asa his son reigned in his stead .
14 : 8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears , out of Judah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bare shields and drew bows , two hundred and fourscore thousand : all these were mighty men of valour .
14 : 12 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa , and before Judah ; and the Ethiopians fled .
15 : 15 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath : for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and the LORD gave them rest round about .
16 : 2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king ' s house , and sent to Benhadad king of Syria , that dwelt at Damascus , saying , 16 : 3 There is a league between me and thee , as there was between my father and thy father : behold , I have sent thee silver and gold ; go , break thy league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me .
yet , because thou didst rely on the LORD , he delivered them into thine hand .
16 : 12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD , but to the physicians .
16 : 14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres , which he had made for himself in the city of David , and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries ' art : and they made a very great burning for him .
17 : 6 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD : moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah .
17 : 9 And they taught in Judah , and had the book of the law of the LORD with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught the people .
17 : 11 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and tribute silver ; and the Arabians brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats .
18 : 12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him , saying , Behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent ; let thy word therefore , I pray thee , be like one of their ' s , and speak thou good .
And he said , Go ye up , and prosper , and they shall be delivered into your hand .
18 : 15 And the king said to him , How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD ?
18 : 20 Then there came out a spirit , and stood before the LORD , and said , I will entice him .
And the LORD said unto him , Wherewith ?
18 : 28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead .
18 : 30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him , saying , Fight ye not with small or great , save only with the king of Israel .
18 : 34 And the battle increased that day : howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
19 : 3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seek God .
19 : 7 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you ; take heed and do it : for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of gifts .
19 : 11 And , behold , Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD ; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael , the ruler of the house of Judah , for all the king ' s matters : also the Levites shall be officers before you .
20 : 2 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat , saying , There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria ; and , behold , they be in Hazazontamar , which is Engedi .
and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen ?
for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us ; neither know we what to do : but our eyes are upon thee .
20 : 20 And they rose early in the morning , and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa : and as they went forth , Jehoshaphat stood and said , Hear me , O Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem ; Believe in the LORD your God , so shall ye be established ; believe his prophets , so shall ye prosper .
20 : 23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir , utterly to slay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , every one helped to destroy another .
20 : 31 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem .
And his mother ' s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
20 : 37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat , saying , Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah , the LORD hath broken thy works .
21 : 1 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David .
21 : 8 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah , and made themselves a king .
22 : 3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab : for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly .
22 : 5 He walked also after their counsel , and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead : and the Syrians smote Joram .
So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom .
So Jehoshabeath , the daughter of king Jehoram , the wife of Jehoiada the priest , ( for she was the sister of Ahaziah ,) hid him from Athaliah , so that she slew him not .
23 : 3 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God .
23 : 16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the LORD ' s people .
23 : 17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
24 : 1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem .
24 : 6 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief , and said unto him , Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection , according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD , and of the congregation of Israel , for the tabernacle of witness ?
24 : 14 And when they had finished it , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada , whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD , even vessels to minister , and to offer withal , and spoons , and vessels of gold and silver .
24 : 26 And these are they that conspired against him ; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess .
25 : 4 But he slew not their children , but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses , where the LORD commanded , saying , The fathers shall not die for the children , neither shall the children die for the fathers , but every man shall die for his own sin .
25 : 20 But Amaziah would not hear ; for it came of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they sought after the gods of Edom .
25 : 25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years .
26 : 9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
26 : 11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men , that went out to war by bands , according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler , under the hand of Hananiah , one of the king ' s captains .
26 : 16 But when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he transgressed against the LORD his God , and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
26 : 22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , did Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , write .
27 : 1 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
27 : 4 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him , both the second year , and the third .
27 : 8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
28 : 12 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against them that came from the war , 28 : 13 And said unto them , Ye shall not bring in the captives hither : for whereas we have offended against the LORD already , ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass : for our trespass is great , and there is fierce wrath against Israel .
28 : 19 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel ; for he made Judah naked , and transgressed sore against the LORD .
28 : 23 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus , which smote him : and he said , Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them , therefore will I sacrifice to them , that they may help me .
But they were the ruin of him , and of all Israel .
28 : 25 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods , and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers .
29 : 19 Moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified , and , behold , they are before the altar of the LORD .
And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD .
29 : 25 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals , with psalteries , and with harps , according to the commandment of David , and of Gad the king ' s seer , and Nathan the prophet : for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets .
29 : 30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer .
But Hezekiah prayed for them , saying , The good LORD pardon every one 30 : 19 That prepareth his heart to seek God , the LORD God of his fathers , though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary .
31 : 5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad , the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn , wine , and oil , and honey , and of all the increase of the field ; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly .
31 : 10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him , and said , Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD , we have had enough to eat , and have left plenty : for the LORD hath blessed his people ; and that which is left is this great store .
And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
So he returned with shame of face to his own land .
32 : 23 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem , and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah : so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
33 : 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem : 33 : 2 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , like unto the abominations of the heathen , whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
33 : 3 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down , and he reared up altars for Baalim , and made groves , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
33 : 6 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom : also he observed times , and used enchantments , and used witchcraft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with wizards : he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
33 : 25 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
34 : 9 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest , they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God , which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim , and of all the remnant of Israel , and of all Judah and Benjamin ; and they returned to Jerusalem .
34 : 13 Also they were over the bearers of burdens , and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service : and of the Levites there were scribes , and officers , and porters .
And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
34 : 20 And the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king ' s , saying , 34 : 21 Go , enquire of the LORD for me , and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah , concerning the words of the book that is found : for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us , because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD , to do after all that is written in this book .
34 : 22 And Hilkiah , and they that the king had appointed , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college :) and they spake to her to that effect .
So they brought the king word again .
34 : 33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel , and made all that were present in Israel to serve , even to serve the LORD their God .
35 : 8 And his princes gave willingly unto the people , to the priests , and to the Levites : Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , rulers of the house of God , gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen .
35 : 12 And they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the LORD , as it is written in the book of Moses .
35 : 26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his goodness , according to that which was written in the law of the LORD , 35 : 27 And his deeds , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
36 : 10 And when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
36 : 15 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising up betimes , and sending ; because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place : 36 : 16 But they mocked the messengers of God , and despised his words , and misused his prophets , until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people , till there was no remedy .
36 : 17 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees , who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary , and had no compassion upon young man or maiden , old man , or him that stooped for age : he gave them all into his hand .
2 : 7 The children of Elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
2 : 29 The children of Nebo , fifty and two .
2 : 30 The children of Magbish , an hundred fifty and six .
2 : 40 The Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy and four .
2 : 41 The singers : the children of Asaph , an hundred twenty and eight .
2 : 58 All the Nethinims , and the children of Solomon ' s servants , were three hundred ninety and two .
2 : 68 And some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place : 2 : 69 They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold , and five thousand pound of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
4 : 1 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel ; 4 : 2 Then they came to Zerubbabel , and to the chief of the fathers , and said unto them , Let us build with you : for we seek your God , as ye do ; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur , which brought us up hither .
4 : 24 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem .
5 : 8 Be it known unto the king , that we went into the province of Judea , to the house of the great God , which is builded with great stones , and timber is laid in the walls , and this work goeth fast on , and prospereth in their hands .
6 : 11 Also I have made a decree , that whosoever shall alter this word , let timber be pulled down from his house , and being set up , let him be hanged thereon ; and let his house be made a dunghill for this .
6 : 12 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people , that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem .
6 : 14 And the elders of the Jews builded , and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo .
6 : 17 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve he goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
6 : 21 And the children of Israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the LORD God of Israel , did eat , 6 : 22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy : for the LORD had made them joyful , and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them , to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God , the God of Israel .
7 : 1 Now after these things , in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia , Ezra the son of Seraiah , the son of Azariah , the son of Hilkiah , 7 : 2 The son of Shallum , the son of Zadok , the son of Ahitub , 7 : 3 The son of Amariah , the son of Azariah , the son of Meraioth , 7 : 4 The son of Zerahiah , the son of Uzzi , the son of Bukki , 7 : 5 The son of Abishua , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the chief priest : 7 : 6 This Ezra went up from Babylon ; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses , which the LORD God of Israel had given : and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him .
7 : 7 And there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , unto Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
7 : 9 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
7 : 11 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest , the scribe , even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD , and of his statutes to Israel .
7 : 24 Also we certify you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , singers , porters , Nethinims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose toll , tribute , or custom , upon them .
7 : 26 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed speedily upon him , whether it be unto death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me , and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me .
8 : 9 Of the sons of Joab ; Obadiah the son of Jehiel , and with him two hundred and eighteen males .
8 : 23 So we fasted and besought our God for this : and he was intreated of us .
8 : 33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest ; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas ; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua , and Noadiah the son of Binnui , Levites ; 8 : 34 By number and by weight of every one : and all the weight was written at that time .
8 : 35 Also the children of those that had been carried away , which were come out of the captivity , offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel , twelve bullocks for all Israel , ninety and six rams , seventy and seven lambs , twelve he goats for a sin offering : all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD .
9 : 1 Now when these things were done , the princes came to me , saying , The people of Israel , and the priests , and the Levites , have not separated themselves from the people of the lands , doing according to their abominations , even of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Jebusites , the Ammonites , the Moabites , the Egyptians , and the Amorites .
9 : 3 And when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down astonied .
10 : 6 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God , and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib : and when he came thither , he did eat no bread , nor drink water : for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away .
10 : 16 And the children of the captivity did so .
10 : 23 Also of the Levites ; Jozabad , and Shimei , and Kelaiah , ( the same is Kelita ,) Pethahiah , Judah , and Eliezer .
10 : 29 And of the sons of Bani ; Meshullam , Malluch , and Adaiah , Jashub , and Sheal , and Ramoth .
10 : 30 And of the sons of Pahathmoab ; Adna , and Chelal , Benaiah , Maaseiah , Mattaniah , Bezaleel , and Binnui , and Manasseh .
10 : 33 Of the sons of Hashum ; Mattenai , Mattathah , Zabad , Eliphelet , Jeremai , Manasseh , and Shimei .
10 : 44 All these had taken strange wives : and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
2 : 2 Wherefore the king said unto me , Why is thy countenance sad , seeing thou art not sick ?
So they strengthened their hands for this good work .
And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri .
And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabeel .
will they sacrifice ?
4 : 15 And it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
4 : 23 So neither I , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clothes , saving that every one put them off for washing .
5 : 2 For there were that said , We , our sons , and our daughters , are many : therefore we take up corn for them , that we may eat , and live .
5 : 8 And I said unto them , We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews , which were sold unto the heathen ; and will ye even sell your brethren ?
5 : 14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah , from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king , that is , twelve years , I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor .
5 : 16 Yea , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work .
5 : 18 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep ; also fowls were prepared for me , and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine : yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor , because the bondage was heavy upon this people .
6 : 11 And I said , Should such a man as I flee ?
I will not go in .
7 : 1 Now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed , 7 : 2 That I gave my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge over Jerusalem : for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
7 : 11 The children of Pahathmoab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen .
7 : 22 The children of Hashum , three hundred twenty and eight .
7 : 29 The men of Kirjathjearim , Chephirah , and Beeroth , seven hundred forty and three .
7 : 35 The children of Harim , three hundred and twenty .
7 : 45 The porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , an hundred thirty and eight .
7 : 63 And of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
8 : 2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
8 : 4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood , which they had made for the purpose ; and beside him stood Mattithiah , and Shema , and Anaiah , and Urijah , and Hilkiah , and Maaseiah , on his right hand ; and on his left hand , Pedaiah , and Mishael , and Malchiah , and Hashum , and Hashbadana , Zechariah , and Meshullam .
8 : 5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ;) and when he opened it , all the people stood up : 8 : 6 And Ezra blessed the LORD , the great God .
And all the people answered , Amen , Amen , with lifting up their hands : and they bowed their heads , and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground .
8 : 8 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly , and gave the sense , and caused them to understand the reading .
8 : 12 And all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared unto them .
8 : 17 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths , and sat under the booths : for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so .
9 : 31 Nevertheless for thy great mercies ' sake thou didst not utterly consume them , nor forsake them ; for thou art a gracious and merciful God .
9 : 35 For they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .
9 : 38 And because of all this we make a sure covenant , and write it ; and our princes , Levites , and priests , seal unto it .
10 : 28 And the rest of the people , the priests , the Levites , the porters , the singers , the Nethinims , and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God , their wives , their sons , and their daughters , every one having knowledge , and having understanding ; 10 : 29 They clave to their brethren , their nobles , and entered into a curse , and into an oath , to walk in God ' s law , which was given by Moses the servant of God , and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord , and his judgments and his statutes ; 10 : 30 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , not take their daughters for our sons : 10 : 31 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell , that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath , or on the holy day : and that we would leave the seventh year , and the exaction of every debt .
11 : 13 And his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and Amashai the son of Azareel , the son of Ahasai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer , 11 : 14 And their brethren , mighty men of valour , an hundred twenty and eight : and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of one of the great men .
11 : 15 Also of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hashub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ; 11 : 16 And Shabbethai and Jozabad , of the chief of the Levites , had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God .
11 : 23 For it was the king ' s commandment concerning them , that a certain portion should be for the singers , due for every day .
12 : 23 The sons of Levi , the chief of the fathers , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
12 : 24 And the chief of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brethren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , ward over against ward .
12 : 27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places , to bring them to Jerusalem , to keep the dedication with gladness , both with thanksgivings , and with singing , with cymbals , psalteries , and with harps .
12 : 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves , and purified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
12 : 44 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures , for the offerings , for the firstfruits , and for the tithes , to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites : for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited .
13 : 10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
13 : 14 Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
13 : 17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said unto them , What evil thing is this that ye do , and profane the sabbath day ?
13 : 23 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod , of Ammon , and of Moab : 13 : 24 And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
yet among many nations was there no king like him , who was beloved of his God , and God made him king over all Israel : nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin .
13 : 29 Remember them , O my God , because they have defiled the priesthood , and the covenant of the priesthood , and of the Levites .
1 : 1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus , ( this is Ahasuerus which reigned , from India even unto Ethiopia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces :) 1 : 2 That in those days , when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace , 1 : 3 In the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him : 1 : 4 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days , even an hundred and fourscore days .
1 : 7 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another ,) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
1 : 9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus .
1 : 21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes ; and the king did according to the word of Memucan : 1 : 22 For he sent letters into all the king ' s provinces , into every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people after their language , that every man should bear rule in his own house , and that it should be published according to the language of every people .
2 : 1 After these things , when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
2 : 8 So it came to pass , when the king ' s commandment and his decree was heard , and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace , to the custody of Hegai , that Esther was brought also unto the king ' s house , to the custody of Hegai , keeper of the women .
2 : 9 And the maiden pleased him , and she obtained kindness of him ; and he speedily gave her her things for purification , with such things as belonged to her , and seven maidens , which were meet to be given her , out of the king ' s house : and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women .
2 : 22 And the thing was known to Mordecai , who told it unto Esther the queen ; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai ' s name .
3 : 4 Now it came to pass , when they spake daily unto him , and he hearkened not unto them , that they told Haman , to see whether Mordecai ' s matters would stand : for he had told them that he was a Jew .
3 : 5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence , then was Haman full of wrath .
Then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it not .
4 : 7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him , and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king ' s treasuries for the Jews , to destroy them .
4 : 12 And they told to Mordecai Esther ' s words .
And the thing pleased Haman ; and he caused the gallows to be made .
Then said the king ' s servants that ministered unto him , There is nothing done for him .
And the king said , Let him come in .
6 : 12 And Mordecai came again to the king ' s gate .
6 : 13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him .
7 : 1 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen .
and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ?
7 : 5 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen , Who is he , and where is he , that durst presume in his heart to do so ?
7 : 8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine ; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was .
As the word went out of king ' s mouth , they covered Haman ' s face .
7 : 9 And Harbonah , one of the chamberlains , said before the king , Behold also , the gallows fifty cubits high , which Haman had made for Mordecai , who spoken good for the king , standeth in the house of Haman .
And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
So Esther arose , and stood before the king , 8 : 5 And said , If it please the king , and if I have favour in his sight , and the thing seem right before the king , and I be pleasing in his eyes , let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king ' s provinces : 8 : 6 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ?
8 : 16 The Jews had light , and gladness , and joy , and honour .
9 : 4 For Mordecai was great in the king ' s house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces : for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater .
9 : 5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
9 : 11 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king .
9 : 20 And Mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , both nigh and far , 9 : 21 To stablish this among them , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly , 9 : 22 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies , and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy , and from mourning into a good day : that they should make them days of feasting and joy , and of sending portions one to another , and gifts to the poor .
1 : 5 And it was so , when the days of their feasting were gone about , that Job sent and sanctified them , and rose up early in the morning , and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all : for Job said , It may be that my sons have sinned , and cursed God in their hearts .
1 : 12 And the LORD said unto Satan , Behold , all that he hath is in thy power ; only upon himself put not forth thine hand .
2 : 1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD .
2 : 2 And the LORD said unto Satan , From whence comest thou ?
and still he holdeth fast his integrity , although thou movedst me against him , to destroy him without cause .
2 : 9 Then said his wife unto him , Dost thou still retain thine integrity ?
shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ?
3 : 4 Let that day be darkness ; let not God regard it from above , neither let the light shine upon it .
3 : 20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ; 3 : 21 Which long for death , but it cometh not ; and dig for it more than for hid treasures ; 3 : 22 Which rejoice exceedingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ?
3 : 24 For my sighing cometh before I eat , and my roarings are poured out like the waters .
4 : 6 Is not this thy fear , thy confidence , thy hope , and the uprightness of thy ways ?
4 : 10 The roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the teeth of the young lions , are broken .
4 : 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night , when deep sleep falleth on men , 4 : 14 Fear came upon me , and trembling , which made all my bones to shake .
they die , even without wisdom .
5 : 8 I would seek unto God , and unto God would I commit my cause : 5 : 9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable ; marvellous things without number : 5 : 10 Who giveth rain upon the earth , and sendeth waters upon the fields : 5 : 11 To set up on high those that be low ; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety .
5 : 24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit thy habitation , and shalt not sin .
5 : 25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth .
5 : 27 Lo this , we have searched it , so it is ; hear it , and know thou it for thy good .
6 : 1 But Job answered and said , 6 : 2 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed , and my calamity laid in the balances together !
6 : 21 For now ye are nothing ; ye see my casting down , and are afraid .
6 : 22 Did I say , Bring unto me ?
6 : 30 Is there iniquity in my tongue ?
7 : 1 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth ?
7 : 12 Am I a sea , or a whale , that thou settest a watch over me ?
why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
8 : 17 His roots are wrapped about the heap , and seeth the place of stones .
9 : 10 Which doeth great things past finding out ; yea , and wonders without number .
9 : 12 Behold , he taketh away , who can hinder him ?
9 : 23 If the scourge slay suddenly , he will laugh at the trial of the innocent .
9 : 34 Let him take his rod away from me , and let not his fear terrify me : 9 : 35 Then would I speak , and not fear him ; but it is not so with me .
10 : 8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about ; yet thou dost destroy me .
11 : 7 Canst thou by searching find out God ?
11 : 8 It is as high as heaven ; what canst thou do ?
12 : 11 Doth not the ear try words ?
12 : 14 Behold , he breaketh down , and it cannot be built again : he shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
12 : 17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled , and maketh the judges fools .
12 : 25 They grope in the dark without light , and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man .
13 : 3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty , and I desire to reason with God .
13 : 4 But ye are forgers of lies , ye are all physicians of no value .
13 : 27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
all the days of my appointed time will I wait , till my change come .
14 : 18 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought , and the rock is removed out of his place .
15 : 4 Yea , thou castest off fear , and restrainest prayer before God .
15 : 11 Are the consolations of God small with thee ?
and what do thy eyes wink at , 15 : 13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God , and lettest such words go out of thy mouth ?
15 : 20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor .
15 : 30 He shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up his branches , and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away .
16 : 6 Though I speak , my grief is not asswaged : and though I forbear , what am I eased ?
16 : 22 When a few years are come , then I shall go the way whence I shall not return .
17 : 5 He that speaketh flattery to his friends , even the eyes of his children shall fail .
17 : 8 Upright men shall be astonied at this , and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite .
17 : 12 They change the night into day : the light is short because of darkness .
17 : 13 If I wait , the grave is mine house : I have made my bed in the darkness .
17 : 14 I have said to corruption , Thou art my father : to the worm , Thou art my mother , and my sister .
17 : 15 And where is now my hope ?
17 : 16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit , when our rest together is in the dust .
and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
18 : 10 The snare is laid for him in the ground , and a trap for him in the way .
18 : 11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall drive him to his feet .
18 : 16 His roots shall be dried up beneath , and above shall his branch be cut off .
19 : 25 For I know that my redeemer liveth , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth : 19 : 26 And though after my skin worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I see God : 19 : 27 Whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not another ; though my reins be consumed within me .
20 : 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite , and said , 20 : 2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer , and for this I make haste .
20 : 11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
20 : 21 There shall none of his meat be left ; therefore shall no man look for his goods .
21 : 8 Their seed is established in their sight with them , and their offspring before their eyes .
21 : 12 They take the timbrel and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the organ .
21 : 20 His eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
21 : 22 Shall any teach God knowledge ?
21 : 23 One dieth in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet .
and who shall repay him what he hath done ?
22 : 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said , 22 : 2 Can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
or is it gain to him , that thou makest thy ways perfect ?
22 : 5 Is not thy wickedness great ?
22 : 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought , and stripped the naked of their clothing .
22 : 15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden ?
22 : 21 Acquaint now thyself with him , and be at peace : thereby good shall come unto thee .
22 : 26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty , and shalt lift up thy face unto God .
22 : 30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent : and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands .
23 : 13 But he is in one mind , and who can turn him ?
and what his soul desireth , even that he doeth .
23 : 14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me : and many such things are with him .
24 : 1 Why , seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty , do they that know him not see his days ?
24 : 4 They turn the needy out of the way : the poor of the earth hide themselves together .
24 : 24 They are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
24 : 25 And if it be not so now , who will make me a liar , and make my speech nothing worth ?
25 : 5 Behold even to the moon , and it shineth not ; yea , the stars are not pure in his sight .
and the son of man , which is a worm ?
26 : 14 Lo , these are parts of his ways : but how little a portion is heard of him ?
27 : 9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him ?
27 : 13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God , and the heritage of oppressors , which they shall receive of the Almighty .
27 : 21 The east wind carrieth him away , and he departeth : and as a storm hurleth him out of his place .
28 : 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof ; neither is it found in the land of the living .
28 : 19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it , neither shall it be valued with pure gold .
28 : 24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth , and seeth under the whole heaven ; 28 : 25 To make the weight for the winds ; and he weigheth the waters by measure .
28 : 28 And unto man he said , Behold , the fear of the LORD , that is wisdom ; and to depart from evil is understanding .
29 : 9 The princes refrained talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
29 : 14 I put on righteousness , and it clothed me : my judgment was as a robe and a diadem .
29 : 20 My glory was fresh in me , and my bow was renewed in my hand .
29 : 21 Unto me men gave ear , and waited , and kept silence at my counsel .
30 : 3 For want and famine they were solitary ; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste .
30 : 4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes , and juniper roots for their meat .
30 : 14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me .
30 : 20 I cry unto thee , and thou dost not hear me : I stand up , and thou regardest me not .
30 : 28 I went mourning without the sun : I stood up , and I cried in the congregation .
30 : 30 My skin is black upon me , and my bones are burned with heat .
31 : 29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him : 31 : 30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul .
32 : 1 So these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
32 : 8 But there is a spirit in man : and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding .
32 : 18 For I am full of matter , the spirit within me constraineth me .
32 : 21 Let me not , I pray you , accept any man ' s person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man .
33 : 31 Mark well , O Job , hearken unto me : hold thy peace , and I will speak .
34 : 12 Yea , surely God will not do wickedly , neither will the Almighty pervert judgment .
34 : 26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others ; 34 : 27 Because they turned back from him , and would not consider any of his ways : 34 : 28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted .
34 : 29 When he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ?
and when he hideth his face , who then can behold him ?
whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only : 34 : 30 That the hypocrite reign not , lest the people be ensnared .
36 : 4 For truly my words shall not be false : he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee .
36 : 10 He openeth also their ear to discipline , and commandeth that they return from iniquity .
36 : 12 But if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
36 : 15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction , and openeth their ears in oppression .
37 : 1 At this also my heart trembleth , and is moved out of his place .
37 : 6 For he saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
37 : 10 By the breath of God frost is given : and the breadth of the waters is straitened .
37 : 21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds : but the wind passeth , and cleanseth them .
38 : 1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind , and said , 38 : 2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge ?
38 : 3 Gird up now thy loins like a man ; for I will demand of thee , and answer thou me .
38 : 4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth ?
or who hath stretched the line upon it ?
38 : 19 Where is the way where light dwelleth ?
and as for darkness , where is the place thereof , 38 : 20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof , and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof ?
38 : 22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow ?
or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons ?
38 : 36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ?
38 : 39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion ?
or fill the appetite of the young lions , 38 : 40 When they couch in their dens , and abide in the covert to lie in wait ?
39 : 3 They bow themselves , they bring forth their young ones , they cast out their sorrows .
39 : 5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free ?
39 : 6 Whose house I have made the wilderness , and the barren land his dwellings .
or will he harrow the valleys after thee ?
39 : 11 Wilt thou trust him , because his strength is great ?
39 : 18 What time she lifteth up herself on high , she scorneth the horse and his rider .
39 : 27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command , and make her nest on high ?
39 : 29 From thence she seeketh the prey , and her eyes behold afar off .
I will lay mine hand upon my mouth .
40 : 8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment ?
40 : 13 Hide them in the dust together ; and bind their faces in secret .
40 : 19 He is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him .
or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?
41 : 2 Canst thou put an hook into his nose ?
wilt thou take him for a servant for ever ?
or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens ?
41 : 9 Behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
41 : 10 None is so fierce that dare stir him up : who then is able to stand before me ?
41 : 14 Who can open the doors of his face ?
41 : 22 In his neck remaineth strength , and sorrow is turned into joy before him .
41 : 26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold : the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon .
42 : 1 Then Job answered the LORD , and said , 42 : 2 I know that thou canst do every thing , and that no thought can be withholden from thee .
42 : 7 And it was so , that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job , the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite , My wrath is kindled against thee , and against thy two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job hath .
42 : 12 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she asses .
2 : 1 Why do the heathen rage , and the people imagine a vain thing ?
2 : 8 Ask of me , and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession .
2 : 11 Serve the LORD with fear , and rejoice with trembling .
Blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
Selah .
4 : 6 There be many that say , Who will shew us any good ?
6 : 3 My soul is also sore vexed : but thou , O LORD , how long ?
6 : 9 The LORD hath heard my supplication ; the LORD will receive my prayer .
7 : 4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me ; ( yea , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy :)
7 : 6 Arise , O LORD , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
7 : 13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death ; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors .
7 : 16 His mischief shall return upon his own head , and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate .
who hast set thy glory above the heavens .
8 : 8 The fowl of the air , and the fish of the sea , and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas .
9 : 10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee : for thou , LORD , hast not forsaken them that seek thee .
9 : 17 The wicked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget God .
9 : 20 Put them in fear , O LORD : that the nations may know themselves to be but men .
10 : 1 Why standest thou afar off , O LORD ?
10 : 9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth him into his net .
10 : 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man : seek out his wickedness till thou find none .
11 : 4 The LORD is in his holy temple , the LORD ' s throne is in heaven : his eyes behold , his eyelids try , the children of men .
12 : 2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour : with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak .
12 : 3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that speaketh proud things :
for ever ?
13 : 3 Consider and hear me , O LORD my God : lighten mine eyes , lest I sleep the sleep of death ;
He that sweareth to his own hurt , and changeth not .
16 : 1 Preserve me , O God : for in thee do I put my trust .
16 : 3 But to the saints that are in the earth , and to the excellent , in whom is all my delight .
16 : 6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places ; yea , I have a goodly heritage .
16 : 7 I will bless the LORD , who hath given me counsel : my reins also instruct me in the night seasons .
17 : 3 Thou hast proved mine heart ; thou hast visited me in the night ; thou hast tried me , and shalt find nothing ; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress .
17 : 9 From the wicked that oppress me , from my deadly enemies , who compass me about .
18 : 9 He bowed the heavens also , and came down : and darkness was under his feet .
18 : 13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens , and the Highest gave his voice ; hail stones and coals of fire .
18 : 35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy right hand hath holden me up , and thy gentleness hath made me great .
19 : 9 The fear of the LORD is clean , enduring for ever : the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether .
19 : 12 Who can understand his errors ?
20 : 4 Grant thee according to thine own heart , and fulfil all thy counsel .
21 : 1 The king shall joy in thy strength , O LORD ; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice !
21 : 2 Thou hast given him his heart ' s desire , and hast not withholden the request of his lips .
21 : 5 His glory is great in thy salvation : honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him .
21 : 10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth , and their seed from among the children of men .
22 : 1 My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
22 : 2 O my God , I cry in the day time , but thou hearest not ; and in the night season , and am not silent .
22 : 17 I may tell all my bones : they look and stare upon me .
22 : 21 Save me from the lion ' s mouth : for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns .
22 : 27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD : and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee .
22 : 29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
23 : 3 He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name ' s sake .
or who shall stand in his holy place ?
25 : 12 What man is he that feareth the LORD ?
him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose .
25 : 13 His soul shall dwell at ease ; and his seed shall inherit the earth .
26 : 9 Gather not my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloody men :
26 : 11 But as for me , I will walk in mine integrity : redeem me , and be merciful unto me .
27 : 6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me : therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy ; I will sing , yea , I will sing praises unto the LORD .
28 : 3 Draw me not away with the wicked , and with the workers of iniquity , which speak peace to their neighbours , but mischief is in their hearts .
29 : 5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars ; yea , the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon .
29 : 6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf ; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn .
29 : 8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness ; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh .
29 : 9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve , and discovereth the forests : and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory .
O LORD my God , I will give thanks unto thee for ever .
31 : 10 For my life is spent with grief , and my years with sighing : my strength faileth because of mine iniquity , and my bones are consumed .
31 : 11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without fled from me .
31 : 12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind : I am like a broken vessel .
31 : 21 Blessed be the LORD : for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city .
32 : 6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
Selah .
33 : 14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth .
33 : 21 For our heart shall rejoice in him , because we have trusted in his holy name .
34 : 6 This poor man cried , and the LORD heard him , and saved him out of all his troubles .
34 : 9 O fear the LORD , ye his saints : for there is no want to them that fear him .
35 : 1 Plead my cause , O LORD , with them that strive with me : fight against them that fight against me .
35 : 2 Take hold of shield and buckler , and stand up for mine help .
35 : 4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul : let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt .
35 : 5 Let them be as chaff before the wind : and let the angel of the LORD chase them .
35 : 6 Let their way be dark and slippery : and let the angel of the LORD persecute them .
35 : 12 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul .
37 : 13 The LORD shall laugh at him : for he seeth that his day is coming .
37 : 29 The righteous shall inherit the land , and dwell therein for ever .
37 : 30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom , and his tongue talketh of judgment .
37 : 36 Yet he passed away , and , lo , he was not : yea , I sought him , but he could not be found .
38 : 5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness .
38 : 15 For in thee , O LORD , do I hope : thou wilt hear , O Lord my God .
38 : 16 For I said , Hear me , lest otherwise they should rejoice over me : when my foot slippeth , they magnify themselves against me .
38 : 22 Make haste to help me , O Lord my salvation .
39 : 1 I said , I will take heed to my ways , that I sin not with my tongue : I will keep my mouth with a bridle , while the wicked is before me .
39 : 2 I was dumb with silence , I held my peace , even from good ; and my sorrow was stirred .
my hope is in thee .
40 : 12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me .
41 : 3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing : thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness .
42 : 3 My tears have been my meat day and night , while they continually say unto me , Where is thy God ?
42 : 4 When I remember these things , I pour out my soul in me : for I had gone with the multitude , I went with them to the house of God , with the voice of joy and praise , with a multitude that kept holyday .
and why art thou disquieted within me ?
44 : 15 My confusion is continually before me , and the shame of my face hath covered me ,
44 : 25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust : our belly cleaveth unto the earth .
45 : 3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh , O most mighty , with thy glory and thy majesty .
45 : 10 Hearken , O daughter , and consider , and incline thine ear ; forget also thine own people , and thy father ' s house ;
46 : 6 The heathen raged , the kingdoms were moved : he uttered his voice , the earth melted .
47 : 1 O clap your hands , all ye people ; shout unto God with the voice of triumph .
47 : 9 The princes of the people are gathered together , even the people of the God of Abraham : for the shields of the earth belong unto God : he is greatly exalted .
48 : 4 For , lo , the kings were assembled , they passed by together .
49 : 6 They that trust in their wealth , and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches ;
49 : 13 This their way is their folly : yet their posterity approve their sayings .
Selah .
49 : 20 Man that is in honour , and understandeth not , is like the beasts that perish .
Selah .
50 : 7 Hear , O my people , and I will speak ; O Israel , and I will testify against thee : I am God , even thy God .
50 : 11 I know all the fowls of the mountains : and the wild beasts of the field are mine .
51 : 3 For I acknowledge my transgressions : and my sin is ever before me .
51 : 11 Cast me not away from thy presence ; and take not thy holy spirit from me .
51 : 13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways ; and sinners shall be converted unto thee .
53 : 1 The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God .
Corrupt are they , and have done abominable iniquity : there is none that doeth good .
who eat up my people as they eat bread : they have not called upon God .
54 : 6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee : I will praise thy name , O LORD ; for it is good .
55 : 1 Give ear to my prayer , O God ; and hide not thyself from my supplication .
55 : 2 Attend unto me , and hear me : I mourn in my complaint , and make a noise ;
55 : 8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest .
55 : 19 God shall hear , and afflict them , even he that abideth of old .
56 : 4 In God I will praise his word , in God I have put my trust ; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me .
56 : 6 They gather themselves together , they hide themselves , they mark my steps , when they wait for my soul .
57 : 1 Be merciful unto me , O God , be merciful unto me : for my soul trusteth in thee : yea , in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge , until these calamities be overpast .
57 : 3 He shall send from heaven , and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up .
Selah .
God shall send forth his mercy and his truth .
59 : 5 Thou therefore , O LORD God of hosts , the God of Israel , awake to visit all the heathen : be not merciful to any wicked transgressors .
59 : 8 But thou , O LORD , shalt laugh at them ; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision .
60 : 1 O God , thou hast cast us off , thou hast scattered us , thou hast been displeased ; O turn thyself to us again .
60 : 4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth .
and thou , O God , which didst not go out with our armies ?
61 : 3 For thou hast been a shelter for me , and a strong tower from the enemy .
61 : 7 He shall abide before God for ever : O prepare mercy and truth , which may preserve him .
62 : 3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man ?
62 : 8 Trust in him at all times ; ye people , pour out your heart before him : God is a refuge for us .
62 : 12 Also unto thee , O Lord , belongeth mercy : for thou renderest to every man according to his work .
63 : 6 When I remember thee upon my bed , and meditate on thee in the night watches .
63 : 8 My soul followeth hard after thee : thy right hand upholdeth me .
63 : 11 But the king shall rejoice in God ; every one that sweareth by him shall glory : but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped .
64 : 5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter : they commune of laying snares privily ; they say , Who shall see them ?
64 : 9 And all men shall fear , and shall declare the work of God ; for they shall wisely consider of his doing .
64 : 10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD , and shall trust in him ; and all the upright in heart shall glory .
65 : 3 Iniquities prevail against me : as for our transgressions , thou shalt purge them away .
65 : 6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains ; being girded with power :
65 : 8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens : thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice .
66 : 3 Say unto God , How terrible art thou in thy works !
66 : 8 O bless our God , ye people , and make the voice of his praise to be heard :
68 : 2 As smoke is driven away , so drive them away : as wax melteth before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
68 : 8 The earth shook , the heavens also dropped at the presence of God : even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
68 : 15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan ; an high hill as the hill of Bashan .
Selah .
68 : 20 He that is our God is the God of salvation ; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death .
68 : 24 They have seen thy goings , O God ; even the goings of my God , my King , in the sanctuary .
68 : 31 Princes shall come out of Egypt ; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God .
Blessed be God .
69 : 1 Save me , O God ; for the waters are come in unto my soul .
69 : 6 Let not them that wait on thee , O Lord GOD of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , O God of Israel .
69 : 8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren , and an alien unto my mother ' s children .
69 : 30 I will praise the name of God with a song , and will magnify him with thanksgiving .
70 : 5 But I am poor and needy : make haste unto me , O God : thou art my help and my deliverer ; O LORD , make no tarrying .
71 : 7 I am as a wonder unto many ; but thou art my strong refuge .
71 : 14 But I will hope continually , and will yet praise thee more and more .
72 : 2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness , and thy poor with judgment .
72 : 5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure , throughout all generations .
72 : 11 Yea , all kings shall fall down before him : all nations shall serve him .
73 : 17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God ; then understood I their end .
73 : 19 How are they brought into desolation , as in a moment !
73 : 21 Thus my heart was grieved , and I was pricked in my reins .
73 : 24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel , and afterward receive me to glory .
74 : 1 O God , why hast thou cast us off for ever ?
74 : 6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers .
74 : 8 They said in their hearts , Let us destroy them together : they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land .
74 : 22 Arise , O God , plead thine own cause : remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily .
75 : 2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly .
75 : 3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved : I bear up the pillars of it .
75 : 4 I said unto the fools , Deal not foolishly : and to the wicked , Lift not up the horn :
75 : 5 Lift not up your horn on high : speak not with a stiff neck .
Selah .
76 : 5 The stouthearted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and none of the men of might have found their hands .
77 : 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night : I commune with mine own heart : and my spirit made diligent search .
77 : 11 I will remember the works of the LORD : surely I will remember thy wonders of old .
77 : 12 I will meditate also of all thy work , and talk of thy doings .
77 : 14 Thou art the God that doest wonders : thou hast declared thy strength among the people .
78 : 15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness , and gave them drink as out of the great depths .
78 : 23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above , and opened the doors of heaven ,
78 : 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
78 : 41 Yea , they turned back and tempted God , and limited the Holy One of Israel .
78 : 42 They remembered not his hand , nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy .
78 : 45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them , which devoured them ; and frogs , which destroyed them .
78 : 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller , and their labour unto the locust .
79 : 3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem ; and there was none to bury them .
79 : 9 Help us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of thy name : and deliver us , and purge away our sins , for thy name ' s sake .
80 : 5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears ; and givest them tears to drink in great measure .
80 : 6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours : and our enemies laugh among themselves .
80 : 17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand , upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself .
81 : 5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out through the land of Egypt : where I heard a language that I understood not .
81 : 8 Hear , O my people , and I will testify unto thee : O Israel , if thou wilt hearken unto me ;
81 : 10 I am the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt : open thy mouth wide , and I will fill it .
82 : 5 They know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are out of course .
83 : 4 They have said , Come , and let us cut them off from being a nation ; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance .
83 : 8 Assur also is joined with them : they have holpen the children of Lot .
83 : 17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever ; yea , let them be put to shame , and perish :
84 : 11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield : the LORD will give grace and glory : no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly .
86 : 3 Be merciful unto me , O Lord : for I cry unto thee daily .
86 : 4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant : for unto thee , O Lord , do I lift up my soul .
86 : 5 For thou , Lord , art good , and ready to forgive ; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee .
86 : 13 For great is thy mercy toward me : and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell .
86 : 14 O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul ; and have not set thee before them .
86 : 17 Shew me a token for good ; that they which hate me may see it , and be ashamed : because thou , LORD , hast holpen me , and comforted me .
87 : 6 The LORD shall count , when he writeth up the people , that this man was born there .
88 : 6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit , in darkness , in the deeps .
88 : 8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an abomination unto them : I am shut up , and I cannot come forth .
or thy faithfulness in destruction ?
89 : 1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever : with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations .
who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD ?
89 : 18 For the LORD is our defence ; and the Holy One of Israel is our king .
89 : 23 And I will beat down his foes before his face , and plague them that hate him .
89 : 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes .
89 : 40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges ; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin .
wilt thou hide thyself for ever ?
89 : 49 Lord , where are thy former lovingkindnesses , which thou swarest unto David in thy truth ?
90 : 5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood ; they are as a sleep : in the morning they are like grass which groweth up .
90 : 12 So teach us to number our days , that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom .
and let it repent thee concerning thy servants .
91 : 3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler , and from the noisome pestilence .
91 : 8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked .
91 : 9 Because thou hast made the LORD , which is my refuge , even the most High , thy habitation ;
91 : 15 He shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him .
92 : 6 A brutish man knoweth not ; neither doth a fool understand this .
92 : 8 But thou , LORD , art most high for evermore .
92 : 13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God .
93 : 4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters , yea , than the mighty waves of the sea .
93 : 5 Thy testimonies are very sure : holiness becometh thine house , O LORD , for ever .
94 : 3 LORD , how long shall the wicked , how long shall the wicked triumph ?
94 : 5 They break in pieces thy people , O LORD , and afflict thine heritage .
he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
94 : 10 He that chastiseth the heathen , shall not he correct ?
he that teacheth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
94 : 11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man , that they are vanity .
or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity ?
94 : 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul .
95 : 10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation , and said , It is a people that do err in their heart , and they have not known my ways :
96 : 11 Let the heavens rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof .
97 : 4 His lightnings enlightened the world : the earth saw , and trembled .
97 : 6 The heavens declare his righteousness , and all the people see his glory .
97 : 9 For thou , LORD , art high above all the earth : thou art exalted far above all gods .
98 : 4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD , all the earth : make a loud noise , and rejoice , and sing praise .
100 : 2 Serve the LORD with gladness : come before his presence with singing .
101 : 6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me : he that walketh in a perfect way , he shall serve me .
102 : 1 Hear my prayer , O LORD , and let my cry come unto thee .
102 : 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin .
102 : 14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones , and favour the dust thereof .
102 : 15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD , and all the kings of the earth thy glory .
102 : 18 This shall be written for the generation to come : and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD .
102 : 19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary ; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth ;
102 : 20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner ; to loose those that are appointed to death ;
102 : 21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion , and his praise in Jerusalem ;
102 : 22 When the people are gathered together , and the kingdoms , to serve the LORD .
102 : 23 He weakened my strength in the way ; he shortened my days .
103 : 11 For as the heaven is high above the earth , so great is his mercy toward them that fear him .
103 : 18 To such as keep his covenant , and to those that remember his commandments to do them .
103 : 22 Bless the LORD , all his works in all places of his dominion : bless the LORD , O my soul .
104 : 15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to shine , and bread which strengtheneth man ' s heart .
104 : 16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap ; the cedars of Lebanon , which he hath planted ;
104 : 23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening .
104 : 26 There go the ships : there is that leviathan , whom thou hast made to play therein .
104 : 31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever : the LORD shall rejoice in his works .
105 : 31 He spake , and there came divers sorts of flies , and lice in all their coasts .
106 : 1 Praise ye the LORD .
106 : 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD ?
106 : 3 Blessed are they that keep judgment , and he that doeth righteousness at all times .
106 : 39 Thus were they defiled with their own works , and went a whoring with their own inventions .
106 : 44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction , when he heard their cry :
106 : 48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting : and let all the people say , Amen .
107 : 13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble , and he saved them out of their distresses .
107 : 22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving , and declare his works with rejoicing .
107 : 24 These see the works of the LORD , and his wonders in the deep .
107 : 31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
107 : 37 And sow the fields , and plant vineyards , which may yield fruits of increase .
107 : 40 He poureth contempt upon princes , and causeth them to wander in the wilderness , where there is no way .
108 : 6 That thy beloved may be delivered : save with thy right hand , and answer me .
108 : 7 God hath spoken in his holiness ; I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and mete out the valley of Succoth .
108 : 8 Gilead is mine ; Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ;
108 : 9 Moab is my washpot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe ; over Philistia will I triumph .
and wilt not thou , O God , go forth with our hosts ?
109 : 2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me : they have spoken against me with a lying tongue .
109 : 4 For my love they are my adversaries : but I give myself unto prayer .
109 : 13 Let his posterity be cut off ; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out .
109 : 18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment , so let it come into his bowels like water , and like oil into his bones .
109 : 25 I became also a reproach unto them : when they looked upon me they shaked their heads .
109 : 26 Help me , O LORD my God : O save me according to thy mercy :
110 : 2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion : rule thou in the midst of thine enemies .
110 : 5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath .
112 : 8 His heart is established , he shall not be afraid , until he see his desire upon his enemies .
Praise , O ye servants of the LORD , praise the name of the LORD .
thou Jordan , that thou wast driven back ?
114 : 6 Ye mountains , that ye skipped like rams ; and ye little hills , like lambs ?
115 : 1 Not unto us , O LORD , not unto us , but unto thy name give glory , for thy mercy , and for thy truth ' s sake .
115 : 4 Their idols are silver and gold , the work of men ' s hands .
115 : 8 They that make them are like unto them ; so is every one that trusteth in them .
115 : 9 O Israel , trust thou in the LORD : he is their help and their shield .
116 : 7 Return unto thy rest , O my soul ; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee .
116 : 16 O LORD , truly I am thy servant ; I am thy servant , and the son of thine handmaid : thou hast loosed my bonds .
116 : 17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving , and will call upon the name of the LORD .
118 : 6 The LORD is on my side ; I will not fear : what can man do unto me ?
118 : 10 All nations compassed me about : but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them .
118 : 14 The LORD is my strength and song , and is become my salvation .
118 : 17 I shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the LORD .
118 : 22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner .
118 : 27 God is the LORD , which hath shewed us light : bind the sacrifice with cords , even unto the horns of the altar .
119 : 3 They also do no iniquity : they walk in his ways .
by taking heed thereto according to thy word .
119 : 13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth .
119 : 18 Open thou mine eyes , that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law .
119 : 28 My soul melteth for heaviness : strengthen thou me according unto thy word .
119 : 29 Remove from me the way of lying : and grant me thy law graciously .
119 : 32 I will run the way of thy commandments , when thou shalt enlarge my heart .
119 : 38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant , who is devoted to thy fear .
119 : 40 Behold , I have longed after thy precepts : quicken me in thy righteousness .
119 : 56 This I had , because I kept thy precepts .
119 : 57 Thou art my portion , O LORD : I have said that I would keep thy words .
119 : 58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart : be merciful unto me according to thy word .
119 : 68 Thou art good , and doest good ; teach me thy statutes .
119 : 76 Let , I pray thee , thy merciful kindness be for my comfort , according to thy word unto thy servant .
119 : 78 Let the proud be ashamed ; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause : but I will meditate in thy precepts .
119 : 80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes ; that I be not ashamed .
119 : 86 All thy commandments are faithful : they persecute me wrongfully ; help thou me .
119 : 88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness ; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth .
119 : 95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me : but I will consider thy testimonies .
119 : 97 O how I love thy law !
119 : 118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes : for their deceit is falsehood .
119 : 134 Deliver me from the oppression of man : so will I keep thy precepts .
119 : 136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes , because they keep not thy law .
119 : 147 I prevented the dawning of the morning , and cried : I hoped in thy word .
119 : 158 I beheld the transgressors , and was grieved ; because they kept not thy word .
119 : 160 Thy word is true from the beginning : and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever .
119 : 163 I hate and abhor lying : but thy law do I love .
119 : 173 Let thine hand help me ; for I have chosen thy precepts .
120 : 2 Deliver my soul , O LORD , from lying lips , and from a deceitful tongue .
120 : 3 What shall be given unto thee ?
122 : 2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates , O Jerusalem .
122 : 8 For my brethren and companions ' sakes , I will now say , Peace be within thee .
123 : 2 Behold , as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters , and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress ; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God , until that he have mercy upon us .
123 : 3 Have mercy upon us , O LORD , have mercy upon us : for we are exceedingly filled with contempt .
124 : 8 Our help is in the name of the LORD , who made heaven and earth .
125 : 2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem , so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever .
125 : 5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways , the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
126 : 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing : then said they among the heathen , The LORD hath done great things for them .
129 : 1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth , may Israel now say :
130 : 3 If thou , LORD , shouldest mark iniquities , O Lord , who shall stand ?
130 : 5 I wait for the LORD , my soul doth wait , and in his word do I hope .
132 : 6 Lo , we heard of it at Ephratah : we found it in the fields of the wood .
132 : 13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion ; he hath desired it for his habitation .
132 : 15 I will abundantly bless her provision : I will satisfy her poor with bread .
133 : 2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron ' s beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
135 : 3 Praise the LORD ; for the LORD is good : sing praises unto his name ; for it is pleasant .
135 : 7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings for the rain ; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries .
135 : 14 For the LORD will judge his people , and he will repent himself concerning his servants .
136 : 1 O give thanks unto the LORD ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
136 : 3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords : for his mercy endureth for ever .
136 : 11 And brought out Israel from among them : for his mercy endureth for ever :
136 : 13 To him which divided the Red sea into parts : for his mercy endureth for ever :
136 : 20 And Og the king of Bashan : for his mercy endureth for ever :
137 : 7 Remember , O LORD , the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem ; who said , Rase it , rase it , even to the foundation thereof .
137 : 8 O daughter of Babylon , who art to be destroyed ; happy shall he be , that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us .
139 : 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me ; it is high , I cannot attain unto it .
139 : 8 If I ascend up into heaven , thou art there : if I make my bed in hell , behold , thou art there .
139 : 20 For they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemies take thy name in vain .
141 : 5 Let the righteous smite me ; it shall be a kindness : and let him reprove me ; it shall be an excellent oil , which shall not break my head : for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities .
141 : 7 Our bones are scattered at the grave ' s mouth , as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth .
In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me .
142 : 7 Bring my soul out of prison , that I may praise thy name : the righteous shall compass me about ; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me .
143 : 4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me ; my heart within me is desolate .
144 : 1 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war , and my fingers to fight :
144 : 8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity , and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
145 : 8 The LORD is gracious , and full of compassion ; slow to anger , and of great mercy .
145 : 11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom , and talk of thy power ;
146 : 7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed : which giveth food to the hungry .
146 : 9 The LORD preserveth the strangers ; he relieveth the fatherless and widow : but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down .
147 : 3 He healeth the broken in heart , and bindeth up their wounds .
147 : 4 He telleth the number of the stars ; he calleth them all by their names .
147 : 13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates ; he hath blessed thy children within thee .
147 : 14 He maketh peace in thy borders , and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat .
148 : 6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever : he hath made a decree which shall not pass .
148 : 8 Fire , and hail ; snow , and vapours ; stormy wind fulfilling his word :
Sing unto the LORD a new song , and his praise in the congregation of saints .
149 : 7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen , and punishments upon the people ;
Praise ye the LORD .
150 : 2 Praise him for his mighty acts : praise him according to his excellent greatness .
1 : 7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge : but fools despise wisdom and instruction .
1 : 11 If they say , Come with us , let us lay wait for blood , let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause : 1 : 12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit : 1 : 13 We shall find all precious substance , we shall fill our houses with spoil : 1 : 14 Cast in thy lot among us ; let us all have one purse : 1 : 15 My son , walk not thou in the way with them ; refrain thy foot from their path : 1 : 16 For their feet run to evil , and make haste to shed blood .
1 : 17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird .
3 : 11 My son , despise not the chastening of the LORD ; neither be weary of his correction : 3 : 12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth ; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth .
3 : 19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth ; by understanding hath he established the heavens .
4 : 1 Hear , ye children , the instruction of a father , and attend to know understanding .
4 : 2 For I give you good doctrine , forsake ye not my law .
4 : 9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace : a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee .
4 : 12 When thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
4 : 14 Enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil men .
5 : 18 Let thy fountain be blessed : and rejoice with the wife of thy youth .
5 : 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD , and he pondereth all his goings .
6 : 5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler .
6 : 6 Go to the ant , thou sluggard ; consider her ways , and be wise : 6 : 7 Which having no guide , overseer , or ruler , 6 : 8 Provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest .
6 : 12 A naughty person , a wicked man , walketh with a froward mouth .
7 : 6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement , 7 : 7 And beheld among the simple ones , I discerned among the youths , a young man void of understanding , 7 : 8 Passing through the street near her corner ; and he went the way to her house , 7 : 9 In the twilight , in the evening , in the black and dark night : 7 : 10 And , behold , there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot , and subtil of heart .
7 : 26 For she hath cast down many wounded : yea , many strong men have been slain by her .
8 : 4 Unto you , O men , I call ; and my voice is to the sons of man .
8 : 24 When there were no depths , I was brought forth ; when there were no fountains abounding with water .
8 : 32 Now therefore hearken unto me , O ye children : for blessed are they that keep my ways .
8 : 34 Blessed is the man that heareth me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at the posts of my doors .
9 : 6 Forsake the foolish , and live ; and go in the way of understanding .
9 : 7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame : and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot .
9 : 11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied , and the years of thy life shall be increased .
10 : 2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing : but righteousness delivereth from death .
11 : 1 A false balance is abomination to the LORD : but a just weight is his delight .
11 : 2 When pride cometh , then cometh shame : but with the lowly is wisdom .
11 : 12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour : but a man of understanding holdeth his peace .
12 : 16 A fool ' s wrath is presently known : but a prudent man covereth shame .
12 : 17 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness : but a false witness deceit .
12 : 20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil : but to the counsellors of peace is joy .
12 : 23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge : but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness .
13 : 1 A wise son heareth his father ' s instruction : but a scorner heareth not rebuke .
13 : 13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed : but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded .
13 : 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul : but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil .
14 : 19 The evil bow before the good ; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous .
14 : 21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth : but he that hath mercy on the poor , happy is he .
14 : 26 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence : and his children shall have a place of refuge .
14 : 29 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding : but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly .
15 : 13 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance : but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken .
15 : 27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house ; but he that hateth gifts shall live .
16 : 2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes ; but the LORD weigheth the spirits .
16 : 6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged : and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil .
16 : 10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king : his mouth transgresseth not in judgment .
16 : 16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold !
and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver !
16 : 22 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it : but the instruction of fools is folly .
16 : 26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself ; for his mouth craveth it of him .
16 : 32 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty ; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city .
17 : 10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool .
17 : 15 He that justifieth the wicked , and he that condemneth the just , even they both are abomination to the LORD .
17 : 16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom , seeing he hath no heart to it ?
17 : 18 A man void of understanding striketh hands , and becometh surety in the presence of his friend .
17 : 24 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding ; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth .
17 : 25 A foolish son is a grief to his father , and bitterness to her that bare him .
18 : 2 A fool hath no delight in understanding , but that his heart may discover itself .
18 : 4 The words of a man ' s mouth are as deep waters , and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook .
18 : 6 A fool ' s lips enter into contention , and his mouth calleth for strokes .
18 : 21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue : and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof .
18 : 24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly : and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother .
19 : 2 Also , that the soul be without knowledge , it is not good ; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth .
19 : 5 A false witness shall not be unpunished , and he that speaketh lies shall not escape .
19 : 7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him : how much more do his friends go far from him ?
19 : 24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom , and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again .
19 : 25 Smite a scorner , and the simple will beware : and reprove one that hath understanding , and he will understand knowledge .
20 : 5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water ; but a man of understanding will draw it out .
20 : 14 It is naught , it is naught , saith the buyer : but when he is gone his way , then he boasteth .
20 : 16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger : and take a pledge of him for a strange woman .
20 : 20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother , his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness .
20 : 23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD ; and a false balance is not good .
20 : 25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy , and after vows to make enquiry .
20 : 29 The glory of young men is their strength : and the beauty of old men is the grey head .
20 : 30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil : so do stripes the inward parts of the belly .
21 : 7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them ; because they refuse to do judgment .
21 : 13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor , he also shall cry himself , but shall not be heard .
21 : 18 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous , and the transgressor for the upright .
21 : 25 The desire of the slothful killeth him ; for his hands refuse to labour .
21 : 30 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD .
22 : 2 The rich and poor meet together : the LORD is the maker of them all .
22 : 4 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches , and honour , and life .
22 : 11 He that loveth pureness of heart , for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend .
22 : 12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge , and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor .
22 : 16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches , and he that giveth to the rich , shall surely come to want .
22 : 27 If thou hast nothing to pay , why should he take away thy bed from under thee ?
22 : 28 Remove not the ancient landmark , which thy fathers have set .
23 : 13 Withhold not correction from the child : for if thou beatest him with the rod , he shall not die .
23 : 25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad , and she that bare thee shall rejoice .
23 : 26 My son , give me thine heart , and let thine eyes observe my ways .
23 : 33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women , and thine heart shall utter perverse things .
24 : 8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person .
and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
24 : 13 My son , eat thou honey , because it is good ; and the honeycomb , which is sweet to thy taste : 24 : 14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul : when thou hast found it , then there shall be a reward , and thy expectation shall not be cut off .
25 : 6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king , and stand not in the place of great men : 25 : 7 For better it is that it be said unto thee , Come up hither ; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen .
25 : 19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth , and a foot out of joint .
25 : 21 If thine enemy be hungry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thirsty , give him water to drink : 25 : 22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head , and the LORD shall reward thee .
25 : 24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman and in a wide house .
26 : 4 Answer not a fool according to his folly , lest thou also be like unto him .
26 : 5 Answer a fool according to his folly , lest he be wise in his own conceit .
26 : 8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling , so is he that giveth honour to a fool .
26 : 12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit ?
26 : 20 Where no wood is , there the fire goeth out : so where there is no talebearer , the strife ceaseth .
27 : 17 Iron sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend .
27 : 20 Hell and destruction are never full ; so the eyes of man are never satisfied .
27 : 21 As the fining pot for silver , and the furnace for gold ; so is a man to his praise .
28 : 6 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness , than he that is perverse in his ways , though he be rich .
28 : 14 Happy is the man that feareth alway : but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief .
28 : 23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue .
28 : 27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack : but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse .
29 : 7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor : but the wicked regardeth not to know it .
there is more hope of a fool than of him .
29 : 27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just : and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked .
30 : 13 There is a generation , O how lofty are their eyes !
30 : 14 There is a generation , whose teeth are as swords , and their jaw teeth as knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy from among men .
There are three things that are never satisfied , yea , four things say not , It is enough : 30 : 16 The grave ; and the barren womb ; the earth that is not filled with water ; and the fire that saith not , It is enough .
30 : 24 There be four things which are little upon the earth , but they are exceeding wise : 30 : 25 The ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ; 30 : 26 The conies are but a feeble folk , yet make they their houses in the rocks ; 30 : 27 The locusts have no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ; 30 : 28 The spider taketh hold with her hands , and is in kings ' palaces .
31 : 23 Her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land .
31 : 25 Strength and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come .
The Preacher
1 : 11 There is no remembrance of former things ; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after .
1 : 13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven : this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith .
2 : 19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ?
2 : 23 For all his days are sorrows , and his travail grief ; yea , his heart taketh not rest in the night .
3 : 12 I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice , and to do good in his life .
3 : 15 That which hath been is now ; and that which is to be hath already been ; and God requireth that which is past .
4 : 1 So I returned , and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
4 : 10 For if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but woe to him that is alone when he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up .
4 : 15 I considered all the living which walk under the sun , with the second child that shall stand up in his stead .
4 : 16 There is no end of all the people , even of all that have been before them : they also that come after shall not rejoice in him .
5 : 7 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities : but fear thou God .
5 : 10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he that loveth abundance with increase : this is also vanity .
5 : 18 Behold that which I have seen : it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink , and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life , which God giveth him : for it is his portion .
5 : 19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth , and hath given him power to eat thereof , and to take his portion , and to rejoice in his labour ; this is the gift of God .
what hath the poor , that knoweth to walk before the living ?
7 : 2 It is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
7 : 3 Sorrow is better than laughter : for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better .
7 : 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
7 : 7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad ; and a gift destroyeth the heart .
7 : 15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity : there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness .
7 : 16 Be not righteous over much ; neither make thyself over wise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
7 : 18 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all .
7 : 23 All this have I proved by wisdom : I said , I will be wise ; but it was far from me .
7 : 25 I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of folly , even of foolishness and madness : 7 : 26 And I find more bitter than death the woman , whose heart is snares and nets , and her hands as bands : whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her ; but the sinner shall be taken by her .
8 : 2 I counsel thee to keep the king ' s commandment , and that in regard of the oath of God .
8 : 10 And so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also vanity .
9 : 1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this , that the righteous , and the wise , and their works , are in the hand of God : no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them .
9 : 3 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun , that there is one event unto all : yea , also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil , and madness is in their heart while they live , and after that they go to the dead .
9 : 5 For the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
9 : 6 Also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
9 : 16 Then said I , Wisdom is better than strength : nevertheless the poor man ' s wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
9 : 17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools .
10 : 2 A wise man ' s heart is at his right hand ; but a fool ' s heart at his left .
10 : 10 If the iron be blunt , and he do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
10 : 13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness : and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
10 : 16 Woe to thee , O land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes eat in the morning !
11 : 3 If the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
12 : 7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was : and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it .
1 : 10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels , thy neck with chains of gold .
1 : 11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver .
1 : 14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi .
1 : 16 Behold , thou art fair , my beloved , yea , pleasant : also our bed is green .
I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
2 : 6 His left hand is under my head , and his right hand doth embrace me .
2 : 7 I charge you , O ye daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
3 : 3 The watchmen that go about the city found me : to whom I said , Saw ye him whom my soul loveth ?
and the smell of thine ointments than all spices !
4 : 13 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates , with pleasant fruits ; camphire , with spikenard , 4 : 14 Spikenard and saffron ; calamus and cinnamon , with all trees of frankincense ; myrrh and aloes , with all the chief spices : 4 : 15 A fountain of gardens , a well of living waters , and streams from Lebanon .
5 : 6 I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved had withdrawn himself , and was gone : my soul failed when he spake : I sought him , but I could not find him ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
what is thy beloved more than another beloved , that thou dost so charge us ?
6 : 3 I am my beloved ' s , and my beloved is mine : he feedeth among the lilies .
7 : 8 I said , I will go up to the palm tree , I will take hold of the boughs thereof : now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine , and the smell of thy nose like apples ; 7 : 9 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved , that goeth down sweetly , causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak .
8 : 10 I am a wall , and my breasts like towers : then was I in his eyes as one that found favour .
8 : 14 Make haste , my beloved , and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices .
1 : 11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me ?
1 : 19 If ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land : 1 : 20 But if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword : for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it .
2 : 10 Enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , for fear of the LORD , and for the glory of his majesty .
3 : 2 The mighty man , and the man of war , the judge , and the prophet , and the prudent , and the ancient , 3 : 3 The captain of fifty , and the honourable man , and the counsellor , and the cunning artificer , and the eloquent orator .
3 : 5 And the people shall be oppressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient , and the base against the honourable .
3 : 10 Say ye to the righteous , that it shall be well with him : for they shall eat the fruit of their doings .
it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his hands shall be given him .
3 : 15 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces , and grind the faces of the poor ?
4 : 2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel .
4 : 3 And it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Zion , and he that remaineth in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem : 4 : 4 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
5 : 8 Woe unto them that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth !
For all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
6 : 6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar : 6 : 7 And he laid it upon my mouth , and said , Lo , this hath touched thy lips ; and thine iniquity is taken away , and thy sin purged .
And he answered , Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant , and the houses without man , and the land be utterly desolate , 6 : 12 And the LORD have removed men far away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land .
7 : 2 And it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is confederate with Ephraim .
If ye will not believe , surely ye shall not be established .
7 : 18 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
7 : 23 And it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
8 : 9 Associate yourselves , O ye people , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; and give ear , all ye of far countries : gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces .
8 : 13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself ; and let him be your fear , and let him be your dread .
8 : 17 And I will wait upon the LORD , that hideth his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
8 : 20 To the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
9 : 16 For the leaders of this people cause them to err ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
For all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
10 : 7 Howbeit he meaneth not so , neither doth his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few .
is not Samaria as Damascus ?
10 : 16 Therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire .
10 : 33 Behold , the Lord , the LORD of hosts , shall lop the bough with terror : and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down , and the haughty shall be humbled .
10 : 34 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron , and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one .
11 : 1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse , and a Branch shall grow out of his roots : 11 : 2 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him , the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD ; 11 : 3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither reprove after the hearing of his ears : 11 : 4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor , and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth : and he shall smite the earth : with the rod of his mouth , and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked .
11 : 8 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice ' den .
11 : 11 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people , which shall be left , from Assyria , and from Egypt , and from Pathros , and from Cush , and from Elam , and from Shinar , and from Hamath , and from the islands of the sea .
11 : 12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations , and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
12 : 4 And in that day shall ye say , Praise the LORD , call upon his name , declare his doings among the people , make mention that his name is exalted .
12 : 5 Sing unto the LORD ; for he hath done excellent things : this is known in all the earth .
12 : 6 Cry out and shout , thou inhabitant of Zion : for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee .
13 : 4 The noise of a multitude in the mountains , like as of a great people ; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together : the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle .
13 : 13 Therefore I will shake the heavens , and the earth shall remove out of her place , in the wrath of the LORD of hosts , and in the day of his fierce anger .
13 : 16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ravished .
art thou become like unto us ?
14 : 23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern , and pools of water : and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction , saith the LORD of hosts .
14 : 24 The LORD of hosts hath sworn , saying , Surely as I have thought , so shall it come to pass ; and as I have purposed , so shall it stand : 14 : 25 That I will break the Assyrian in my land , and upon my mountains tread him under foot : then shall his yoke depart from off them , and his burden depart from off their shoulders .
14 : 27 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed , and who shall disannul it ?
14 : 29 Rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent ' s root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
That the LORD hath founded Zion , and the poor of his people shall trust in it .
Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; 15 : 2 He is gone up to Bajith , and to Dibon , the high places , to weep : Moab shall howl over Nebo , and over Medeba : on all their heads shall be baldness , and every beard cut off .
16 : 4 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee , Moab ; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler : for the extortioner is at an end , the spoiler ceaseth , the oppressors are consumed out of the land .
16 : 6 We have heard of the pride of Moab ; he is very proud : even of his haughtiness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
17 : 1 The burden of Damascus .
17 : 2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken : they shall be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
17 : 8 And he shall not look to the altars , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fingers have made , either the groves , or the images .
17 : 9 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough , and an uppermost branch , which they left because of the children of Israel : and there shall be desolation .
18 : 1 Woe to the land shadowing with wings , which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia : 18 : 2 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea , even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters , saying , Go , ye swift messengers , to a nation scattered and peeled , to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto ; a nation meted out and trodden down , whose land the rivers have spoiled !
19 : 3 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof ; and I will destroy the counsel thereof : and they shall seek to the idols , and to the charmers , and to them that have familiar spirits , and to the wizards .
19 : 10 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof , all that make sluices and ponds for fish .
19 : 11 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools , the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish : how say ye unto Pharaoh , I am the son of the wise , the son of ancient kings ?
19 : 22 And the LORD shall smite Egypt : he shall smite and heal it : and they shall return even to the LORD , and he shall be intreated of them , and shall heal them .
20 : 6 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day , Behold , such is our expectation , whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria : and how shall we escape ?
Go up , O Elam : besiege , O Media ; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease .
21 : 7 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen , a chariot of asses , and a chariot of camels ; and he hearkened diligently with much heed : 21 : 8 And he cried , A lion : My lord , I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime , and I am set in my ward whole nights : 21 : 9 And , behold , here cometh a chariot of men , with a couple of horsemen .
21 : 16 For thus hath the LORD said unto me , Within a year , according to the years of an hireling , and all the glory of Kedar shall fail : 21 : 17 And the residue of the number of archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , shall be diminished : for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it .
22 : 9 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
22 : 22 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn .
23 : 10 Pass through thy land as a river , O daughter of Tarshish : there is no more strength .
24 : 4 The earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughty people of the earth do languish .
24 : 6 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth , and they that dwell therein are desolate : therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
24 : 13 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
25 : 3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee , the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee .
25 : 6 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
25 : 7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people , and the vail that is spread over all nations .
26 : 18 We have been with child , we have been in pain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
Awake and sing , ye that dwell in dust : for thy dew is as the dew of herbs , and the earth shall cast out the dead .
27 : 4 Fury is not in me : who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle ?
27 : 6 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root : Israel shall blossom and bud , and fill the face of the world with fruit .
27 : 13 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the great trumpet shall be blown , and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria , and the outcasts in the land of Egypt , and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem .
28 : 5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people , 28 : 6 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate .
28 : 14 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD , ye scornful men , that rule this people which is in Jerusalem .
28 : 20 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
doth he open and break the clods of his ground ?
29 : 8 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth , and , behold , he eateth ; but he awaketh , and his soul is empty : or as when a thirsty man dreameth , and , behold , he drinketh ; but he awaketh , and , behold , he is faint , and his soul hath appetite : so shall the multitude of all the nations be , that fight against mount Zion .
29 : 10 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep , and hath closed your eyes : the prophets and your rulers , the seers hath he covered .
and who knoweth us ?
29 : 18 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity , and out of darkness .
29 : 19 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
29 : 20 For the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scorner is consumed , and all that watch for iniquity are cut off : 29 : 21 That make a man an offender for a word , and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate , and turn aside the just for a thing of nought .
30 : 8 Now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever : 30 : 9 That this is a rebellious people , lying children , children that will not hear the law of the LORD : 30 : 10 Which say to the seers , See not ; and to the prophets , Prophesy not unto us right things , speak unto us smooth things , prophesy deceits : 30 : 11 Get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us .
30 : 33 For Tophet is ordained of old ; yea , for the king it is prepared ; he hath made it deep and large : the pile thereof is fire and much wood ; the breath of the LORD , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it .
31 : 2 Yet he also is wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of them that work iniquity .
31 : 3 Now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit .
31 : 9 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear , and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign , saith the LORD , whose fire is in Zion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
32 : 3 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken .
32 : 4 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
32 : 5 The vile person shall be no more called liberal , nor the churl said to be bountiful .
32 : 17 And the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever .
33 : 1 Woe to thee that spoilest , and thou wast not spoiled ; and dealest treacherously , and they dealt not treacherously with thee !
33 : 7 Behold , their valiant ones shall cry without : the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly .
Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire ?
where is he that counted the towers ?
33 : 24 And the inhabitant shall not say , I am sick : the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity .
34 : 6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood , it is made fat with fatness , and with the blood of lambs and goats , with the fat of the kidneys of rams : for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah , and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea .
34 : 10 It shall not be quenched night nor day ; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
34 : 12 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom , but none shall be there , and all her princes shall be nothing .
34 : 17 And he hath cast the lot for them , and his hand hath divided it unto them by line : they shall possess it for ever , from generation to generation shall they dwell therein .
35 : 4 Say to them that are of a fearful heart , Be strong , fear not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , even God with a recompence ; he will come and save you .
35 : 5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped .
35 : 8 And an highway shall be there , and a way , and it shall be called The way of holiness ; the unclean shall not pass over it ; but it shall be for those : the wayfaring men , though fools , shall not err therein .
36 : 4 And Rabshakeh said unto them , Say ye now to Hezekiah , Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria , What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
36 : 8 Now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
36 : 20 Who are they among all the gods of these lands , that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
36 : 21 But they held their peace , and answered him not a word : for the king ' s commandment was , saying , Answer him not .
37 : 4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God , and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left .
37 : 6 And Isaiah said unto them , Thus shall ye say unto your master , Thus saith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
37 : 18 Of a truth , LORD , the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations , and their countries , 37 : 19 And have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men ' s hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
37 : 20 Now therefore , O LORD our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD , even thou only .
now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps .
37 : 30 And this shall be a sign unto thee , Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself ; and the second year that which springeth of the same : and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruit thereof .
37 : 31 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward : 37 : 32 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this .
And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Set thine house in order : for thou shalt die , and not live .
38 : 9 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness : 38 : 10 I said in the cutting off of my days , I shall go to the gates of the grave : I am deprived of the residue of my years .
38 : 17 Behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back .
39 : 4 Then said he , What have they seen in thine house ?
He said moreover , For there shall be peace and truth in my days .
40 : 8 The grass withereth , the flower fadeth : but the word of our God shall stand for ever .
40 : 9 O Zion , that bringest good tidings , get thee up into the high mountain ; O Jerusalem , that bringest good tidings , lift up thy voice with strength ; lift it up , be not afraid ; say unto the cities of Judah , Behold your God !
40 : 10 Behold , the Lord GOD will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
40 : 14 With whom took he counsel , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and shewed to him the way of understanding ?
40 : 17 All nations before him are as nothing ; and they are counted to him less than nothing , and vanity .
40 : 22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain , and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in : 40 : 23 That bringeth the princes to nothing ; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity .
saith the Holy One .
41 : 3 He pursued them , and passed safely ; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet .
41 : 22 Let them bring them forth , and shew us what shall happen : let them shew the former things , what they be , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or declare us things for to come .
41 : 24 Behold , ye are of nothing , and your work of nought : an abomination is he that chooseth you .
and beforetime , that we may say , He is righteous ?
41 : 27 The first shall say to Zion , Behold , behold them : and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings .
41 : 28 For I beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no counsellor , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
42 : 12 Let them give glory unto the LORD , and declare his praise in the islands .
42 : 15 I will make waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will dry up the pools .
who is blind as he that is perfect , and blind as the LORD ' s servant ?
42 : 23 Who among you will give ear to this ?
43 : 18 Remember ye not the former things , neither consider the things of old .
43 : 22 But thou hast not called upon me , O Jacob ; but thou hast been weary of me , O Israel .
43 : 27 Thy first father hath sinned , and thy teachers have transgressed against me .
44 : 7 And who , as I , shall call , and shall declare it , and set it in order for me , since I appointed the ancient people ?
44 : 10 Who hath formed a god , or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing ?
44 : 13 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule ; he marketh it out with a line ; he fitteth it with planes , and he marketh it out with the compass , and maketh it after the figure of a man , according to the beauty of a man ; that it may remain in the house .
44 : 19 And none considereth in his heart , neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say , I have burned part of it in the fire ; yea , also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof ; I have roasted flesh , and eaten it : and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination ?
45 : 7 I form the light , and create darkness : I make peace , and create evil : I the LORD do all these things .
45 : 11 Thus saith the LORD , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker , Ask me of things to come concerning my sons , and concerning the work of my hands command ye me .
45 : 25 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified , and shall glory .
46 : 5 To whom will ye liken me , and make me equal , and compare me , that we may be like ?
47 : 5 Sit thou silent , and get thee into darkness , O daughter of the Chaldeans : for thou shalt no more be called , The lady of kingdoms .
47 : 8 Therefore hear now this , thou that art given to pleasures , that dwellest carelessly , that sayest in thine heart , I am , and none else beside me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children : 47 : 9 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day , the loss of children , and widowhood : they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries , and for the great abundance of thine enchantments .
48 : 12 Hearken unto me , O Jacob and Israel , my called ; I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
48 : 20 Go ye forth of Babylon , flee ye from the Chaldeans , with a voice of singing declare ye , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth ; say ye , The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob .
48 : 22 There is no peace , saith the LORD , unto the wicked .
They shall feed in the ways , and their pastures shall be in all high places .
Behold , I was left alone ; these , where had they been ?
49 : 26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh ; and they shall be drunken with their own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
50 : 2 Wherefore , when I came , was there no man ?
51 : 9 Awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the LORD ; awake , as in the ancient days , in the generations of old .
51 : 11 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return , and come with singing unto Zion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gladness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
51 : 16 And I have put my words in thy mouth , and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand , that I may plant the heavens , and lay the foundations of the earth , and say unto Zion , Thou art my people .
52 : 2 Shake thyself from the dust ; arise , and sit down , O Jerusalem : loose thyself from the bands of thy neck , O captive daughter of Zion .
they that rule over them make them to howl , saith the LORD ; and my name continually every day is blasphemed .
52 : 8 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the LORD shall bring again Zion .
52 : 10 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
53 : 1 Who hath believed our report ?
and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed ?
53 : 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his stripes we are healed .
53 : 9 And he made his grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
54 : 8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee , saith the LORD thy Redeemer .
54 : 12 And I will make thy windows of agates , and thy gates of carbuncles , and all thy borders of pleasant stones .
54 : 13 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD ; and great shall be the peace of thy children .
54 : 14 In righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
54 : 15 Behold , they shall surely gather together , but not by me : whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake .
55 : 10 For as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater : 55 : 11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it .
56 : 4 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths , and choose the things that please me , and take hold of my covenant ; 56 : 5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters : I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
57 : 17 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth , and smote him : I hid me , and was wroth , and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart .
57 : 20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea , when it cannot rest , whose waters cast up mire and dirt .
58 : 2 Yet they seek me daily , and delight to know my ways , as a nation that did righteousness , and forsook not the ordinance of their God : they ask of me the ordinances of justice ; they take delight in approaching to God .
58 : 3 Wherefore have we fasted , say they , and thou seest not ?
58 : 5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen ?
58 : 13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath , from doing thy pleasure on my holy day ; and call the sabbath a delight , the holy of the LORD , honourable ; and shalt honour him , not doing thine own ways , nor finding thine own pleasure , nor speaking thine own words : 58 : 14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD ; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth , and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father : for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it .
59 : 5 They hatch cockatrice ' eggs , and weave the spider ' s web : he that eateth of their eggs dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper .
59 : 9 Therefore is judgment far from us , neither doth justice overtake us : we wait for light , but behold obscurity ; for brightness , but we walk in darkness .
60 : 1 Arise , shine ; for thy light is come , and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee .
60 : 16 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles , and shalt suck the breast of kings : and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
60 : 22 A little one shall become a thousand , and a small one a strong nation : I the LORD will hasten it in his time .
61 : 5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers .
62 : 2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness , and all kings thy glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the LORD shall name .
62 : 6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls , O Jerusalem , which shall never hold their peace day nor night : ye that make mention of the LORD , keep not silence , 62 : 7 And give him no rest , till he establish , and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth .
this that is glorious in his apparel , travelling in the greatness of his strength ?
63 : 7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD , and the praises of the LORD , according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us , and the great goodness toward the house of Israel , which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses .
63 : 9 In all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bare them , and carried them all the days of old .
63 : 15 Look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory : where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me ?
63 : 18 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary .
64 : 5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness , those that remember thee in thy ways : behold , thou art wroth ; for we have sinned : in those is continuance , and we shall be saved .
64 : 10 Thy holy cities are a wilderness , Zion is a wilderness , Jerusalem a desolation .
65 : 6 Behold , it is written before me : I will not keep silence , but will recompense , even recompense into their bosom , 65 : 7 Your iniquities , and the iniquities of your fathers together , saith the LORD , which have burned incense upon the mountains , and blasphemed me upon the hills : therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom .
65 : 8 Thus saith the LORD , As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one saith , Destroy it not ; for a blessing is in it : so will I do for my servants ' sakes , that I may not destroy them all .
65 : 9 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
65 : 10 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in , for my people that have sought me .
66 : 5 Hear the word of the LORD , ye that tremble at his word ; Your brethren that hated you , that cast you out for my name ' s sake , said , Let the LORD be glorified : but he shall appear to your joy , and they shall be ashamed .
66 : 22 For as the new heavens and the new earth , which I will make , shall remain before me , saith the LORD , so shall your seed and your name remain .
1 : 3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah , unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month .
1 : 14 Then the LORD said unto me , Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
1 : 15 For , lo , I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north , saith the LORD ; and they shall come , and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all the walls thereof round about , and against all the cities of Judah .
2 : 11 Hath a nation changed their gods , which are yet no gods ?
2 : 17 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God , when he led thee by the way ?
2 : 18 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Sihor ?
2 : 22 For though thou wash thee with nitre , and take thee much soap , yet thine iniquity is marked before me , saith the Lord GOD .
see thy way in the valley , know what thou hast done : thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways ; 2 : 24 A wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ?
2 : 26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets .
wherefore say my people , We are lords ; we will come no more unto thee ?
3 : 2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places , and see where thou hast not been lien with .
3 : 13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God , and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed my voice , saith the LORD .
3 : 16 And it shall come to pass , when ye be multiplied and increased in the land , in those days , saith the LORD , they shall say no more , The ark of the covenant of the LORD : neither shall it come to mind : neither shall they remember it ; neither shall they visit it ; neither shall that be done any more .
4 : 1 If thou wilt return , O Israel , saith the LORD , return unto me : and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight , then shalt thou not remove .
4 : 4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD , and take away the foreskins of your heart , ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem : lest my fury come forth like fire , and burn that none can quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
4 : 20 Destruction upon destruction is cried ; for the whole land is spoiled : suddenly are my tents spoiled , and my curtains in a moment .
4 : 21 How long shall I see the standard , and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
5 : 3 O LORD , are not thine eyes upon the truth ?
thy children have forsaken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery , and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ' houses .
saith the LORD : and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
then shalt thou answer them , Like as ye have forsaken me , and served strange gods in your land , so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not your ' s .
6 : 5 Arise , and let us go by night , and let us destroy her palaces .
6 : 13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
6 : 17 Also I set watchmen over you , saying , Hearken to the sound of the trumpet .
7 : 5 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings ; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour ; 7 : 6 If ye oppress not the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , and shed not innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your hurt : 7 : 7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , for ever and ever .
7 : 15 And I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brethren , even the whole seed of Ephraim .
7 : 25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them : 7 : 26 Yet they hearkened not unto me , nor inclined their ear , but hardened their neck : they did worse than their fathers .
7 : 31 And they have built the high places of Tophet , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I commanded them not , neither came it into my heart .
7 : 34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah , and from the streets of Jerusalem , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride : for the land shall be desolate .
8 : 4 Moreover thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD ; Shall they fall , and not arise ?
8 : 16 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan : the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones ; for they are come , and have devoured the land , and all that is in it ; the city , and those that dwell therein .
is not her king in her ?
9 : 3 And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , saith the LORD .
9 : 7 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , Behold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people ?
9 : 13 And the LORD saith , Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them , and have not obeyed my voice , neither walked therein ; 9 : 14 But have walked after the imagination of their own heart , and after Baalim , which their fathers taught them : 9 : 15 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
9 : 23 Thus saith the LORD , Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , let not the rich man glory in his riches : 9 : 24 But let him that glorieth glory in this , that he understandeth and knoweth me , that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness , judgment , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things I delight , saith the LORD .
10 : 17 Gather up thy wares out of the land , O inhabitant of the fortress .
10 : 19 Woe is me for my hurt !
my wound is grievous ; but I said , Truly this is a grief , and I must bear it .
10 : 21 For the pastors are become brutish , and have not sought the LORD : therefore they shall not prosper , and all their flocks shall be scattered .
10 : 23 O LORD , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
11 : 6 Then the LORD said unto me , Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , Hear ye the words of this covenant , and do them .
11 : 9 And the LORD said unto me , A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah , and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
11 : 10 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , which refused to hear my words ; and they went after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers .
11 : 11 Therefore thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry unto me , I will not hearken unto them .
11 : 12 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go , and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
11 : 13 For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods , O Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing , even altars to burn incense unto Baal .
11 : 21 Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth , that seek thy life , saying , Prophesy not in the name of the LORD , that thou die not by our hand : 11 : 22 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , Behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine : 11 : 23 And there shall be no remnant of them : for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
12 : 7 I have forsaken mine house , I have left mine heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
12 : 10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
13 : 1 Thus saith the LORD unto me , Go and get thee a linen girdle , and put it upon thy loins , and put it not in water .
13 : 19 The cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Judah shall be carried away captive all of it , it shall be wholly carried away captive .
13 : 26 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face , that thy shame may appear .
14 : 17 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them ; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease : for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous blow .
14 : 22 Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain ?
or can the heavens give showers ?
15 : 5 For who shall have pity upon thee , O Jerusalem ?
or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest ?
15 : 7 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will bereave them of children , I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways .
15 : 10 Woe is me , my mother , that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth !
15 : 12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel ?
wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar , and as waters that fail ?
or what is our iniquity ?
or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God ?
16 : 14 Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that it shall no more be said , The LORD liveth , that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ; 16 : 15 But , The LORD liveth , that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the lands whither he had driven them : and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers .
17 : 1 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is graven upon the table of their heart , and upon the horns of your altars ; 17 : 2 Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills .
17 : 10 I the LORD search the heart , I try the reins , even to give every man according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings .
17 : 13 O LORD , the hope of Israel , all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the LORD , the fountain of living waters .
18 : 7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up , and to pull down , and to destroy it ; 18 : 8 If that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them .
18 : 13 Therefore thus saith the LORD ; Ask ye now among the heathen , who hath heard such things : the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing .
Come , and let us smite him with the tongue , and let us not give heed to any of his words .
20 : 8 For since I spake , I cried out , I cried violence and spoil ; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me , and a derision , daily .
22 : 7 And I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down thy choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
did not thy father eat and drink , and do judgment and justice , and then it was well with him ?
22 : 26 And I will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
23 : 10 For the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourneth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
who hath marked his word , and heard it ?
23 : 23 Am I a God at hand , saith the LORD , and not a God afar off ?
23 : 24 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him ?
23 : 25 I have heard what the prophets said , that prophesy lies in my name , saying , I have dreamed , I have dreamed .
23 : 26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies ?
24 : 4 Again the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 24 : 5 Thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Like these good figs , so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good .
25 : 16 And they shall drink , and be moved , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
25 : 17 Then took I the cup at the LORD ' s hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom the LORD had sent me : 25 : 18 To wit , Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , an hissing , and a curse ; as it is this day ; 25 : 19 Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ; 25 : 20 And all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod , 25 : 21 Edom , and Moab , and the children of Ammon , 25 : 22 And all the kings of Tyrus , and all the kings of Zidon , and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea , 25 : 23 Dedan , and Tema , and Buz , and all that are in the utmost corners , 25 : 24 And all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert , 25 : 25 And all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes , 25 : 26 And all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
25 : 27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Drink ye , and be drunken , and spue , and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you .
25 : 38 He hath forsaken his covert , as the lion : for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor , and because of his fierce anger .
26 : 4 And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD ; If ye will not hearken to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you , 26 : 5 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ; 26 : 6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth .
27 : 14 Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you , saying , Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon : for they prophesy a lie unto you .
29 : 20 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD , all ye of the captivity , whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon : 29 : 21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , of Ahab the son of Kolaiah , and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah , which prophesy a lie unto you in my name ; Behold , I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall slay them before your eyes ; 29 : 22 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon , saying , The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab , whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire ; 29 : 23 Because they have committed villany in Israel , and have committed adultery with their neighbours ' wives , and have spoken lying words in my name , which I have not commanded them ; even I know , and am a witness , saith the LORD .
30 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD , saying , 30 : 2 Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel , saying , Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book .
30 : 5 For thus saith the LORD ; We have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
30 : 11 For I am with thee , saith the LORD , to save thee : though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee , yet I will not make a full end of thee : but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether unpunished .
thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity : because thy sins were increased , I have done these things unto thee .
30 : 20 Their children also shall be as aforetime , and their congregation shall be established before me , and I will punish all that oppress them .
saith the LORD .
31 : 19 Surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I smote upon my thigh : I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because I did bear the reproach of my youth .
31 : 26 Upon this I awaked , and beheld ; and my sleep was sweet unto me .
31 : 27 Behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .
31 : 29 In those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten a sour grape , and the children ' s teeth are set on edge .
31 : 31 Behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah : 31 : 32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my covenant they brake , although I was an husband unto them , saith the LORD : 31 : 33 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel ; After those days , saith the LORD , I will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts ; and will be their God , and they shall be my people .
32 : 11 So I took the evidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and custom , and that which was open : 32 : 12 And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , the son of Maaseiah , in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle ' s son , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase , before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison .
32 : 35 And they built the high places of Baal , which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech ; which I commanded them not , neither came it into my mind , that they should do this abomination , to cause Judah to sin .
32 : 42 For thus saith the LORD ; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people , so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them .
33 : 1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying , 33 : 2 Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof , the LORD that formed it , to establish it ; the LORD is his name ; 33 : 3 Call unto me , and I will answer thee , and shew thee great and mighty things , which thou knowest not .
33 : 4 For thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah , which are thrown down by the mounts , and by the sword ; 33 : 5 They come to fight with the Chaldeans , but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men , whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city .
33 : 10 Thus saith the LORD ; Again there shall be heard in this place , which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast , even in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , that are desolate , without man , and without inhabitant , and without beast , 33 : 11 The voice of joy , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the voice of them that shall say , Praise the LORD of hosts : for the LORD is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever : and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD .
34 : 8 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD , after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ; 34 : 9 That every man should let his manservant , and every man his maidservant , being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to wit , of a Jew his brother .
35 : 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying , 35 : 2 Go unto the house of the Rechabites , and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the LORD , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
35 : 6 But they said , We will drink no wine : for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us , saying , Ye shall drink no wine , neither ye , nor your sons for ever : 35 : 7 Neither shall ye build house , nor sow seed , nor plant vineyard , nor have any : but all your days ye shall dwell in tents ; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers .
35 : 11 But it came to pass , when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians : so we dwell at Jerusalem .
35 : 16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father , which he commanded them ; but this people hath not hearkened unto me : 35 : 17 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them : because I have spoken unto them , but they have not heard ; and I have called unto them , but they have not answered .
36 : 7 It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD , and will return every one from his evil way : for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people .
36 : 15 And they said unto him , Sit down now , and read it in our ears .
36 : 16 Now it came to pass , when they had heard all the words , they were afraid both one and other , and said unto Baruch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
36 : 23 And it came to pass , that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves , he cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth , until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth .
36 : 24 Yet they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
36 : 26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet : but the LORD hid them .
37 : 2 But neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hearken unto the words of the LORD , which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah .
37 : 5 Then Pharaoh ' s army was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them , they departed from Jerusalem .
37 : 13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the ward was there , whose name was Irijah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah ; and he took Jeremiah the prophet , saying , Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans .
And Jeremiah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
38 : 5 Then Zedekiah the king said , Behold , he is in your hand : for the king is not he that can do any thing against you .
and if I give thee counsel , wilt thou not hearken unto me ?
38 : 21 But if thou refuse to go forth , this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me : 38 : 22 And , behold , all the women that are left in the king of Judah ' s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon ' s princes , and those women shall say , Thy friends have set thee on , and have prevailed against thee : thy feet are sunk in the mire , and they are turned away back .
39 : 6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah .
39 : 9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
39 : 15 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying , 39 : 16 Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , saying , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will bring my words upon this city for evil , and not for good ; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee .
39 : 17 But I will deliver thee in that day , saith the LORD : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
41 : 6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
41 : 13 Now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
41 : 15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men , and went to the Ammonites .
42 : 5 Then they said to Jeremiah , The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us .
42 : 8 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest , 42 : 9 And said unto them , Thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him ; 42 : 10 If ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up : for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you .
42 : 11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , saith the LORD : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
42 : 12 And I will shew mercies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
42 : 20 For ye dissembled in your hearts , when ye sent me unto the LORD your God , saying , Pray for us unto the LORD our God ; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say , so declare unto us , and we will do it .
43 : 11 And when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
44 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt , which dwell at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the country of Pathros , saying , 44 : 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , and upon all the cities of Judah ; and , behold , this day they are a desolation , and no man dwelleth therein , 44 : 3 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn incense , and to serve other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
44 : 11 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will set my face against you for evil , and to cut off all Judah .
44 : 29 And this shall be a sign unto you , saith the LORD , that I will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil : 44 : 30 Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies , and into the hand of them that seek his life ; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , his enemy , and that sought his life .
46 : 10 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts , a day of vengeance , that he may avenge him of his adversaries : and the sword shall devour , and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood : for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates .
46 : 14 Declare ye in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes : say ye , Stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall devour round about thee .
46 : 19 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt , furnish thyself to go into captivity : for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant .
46 : 20 Egypt is like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
46 : 22 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
46 : 25 The LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , saith ; Behold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with their gods , and their kings ; even Pharaoh , and all them that trust in him : 46 : 26 And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , saith the LORD .
47 : 6 O thou sword of the LORD , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ?
48 : 5 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up ; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction .
48 : 9 Give wings unto Moab , that it may flee and get away : for the cities thereof shall be desolate , without any to dwell therein .
48 : 13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh , as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence .
48 : 14 How say ye , We are mighty and strong men for the war ?
48 : 15 Moab is spoiled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , saith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
48 : 30 I know his wrath , saith the LORD ; but it shall not be so ; his lies shall not so effect it .
48 : 43 Fear , and the pit , and the snare , shall be upon thee , O inhabitant of Moab , saith the LORD .
the people of Chemosh perisheth : for thy sons are taken captives , and thy daughters captives .
hath he no heir ?
thou shalt not go unpunished , but thou shalt surely drink of it .
49 : 14 I have heard a rumour from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen , saying , Gather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
and who will appoint me the time ?
49 : 20 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD , that he hath taken against Edom ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them .
49 : 29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away : they shall take to themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry unto them , Fear is on every side .
49 : 37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life : and I will bring evil upon them , even my fierce anger , saith the LORD ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them : 49 : 38 And I will set my throne in Elam , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes , saith the LORD .
50 : 6 My people hath been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray , they have turned them away on the mountains : they have gone from mountain to hill , they have forgotten their restingplace .
50 : 18 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
50 : 20 In those days , and in that time , saith the LORD , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I reserve .
how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations !
50 : 25 The LORD hath opened his armoury , and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation : for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans .
50 : 40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof , saith the LORD ; so shall no man abide there , neither shall any son of man dwell therein .
50 : 46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved , and the cry is heard among the nations .
51 : 4 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans , and they that are thrust through in her streets .
51 : 6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the LORD ' s vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
51 : 10 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God .
51 : 15 He hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding .
51 : 25 Behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , saith the LORD , which destroyest all the earth : and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
51 : 26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith the LORD .
51 : 38 They shall roar together like lions : they shall yell as lions ' whelps .
51 : 44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up : and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him : yea , the wall of Babylon shall fall .
51 : 46 And lest your heart faint , and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land ; a rumour shall both come one year , and after that in another year shall come a rumour , and violence in the land , ruler against ruler .
51 : 50 Ye that have escaped the sword , go away , stand not still : remember the LORD afar off , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
51 : 60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon , even all these words that are written against Babylon .
52 : 1 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem .
52 : 8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
52 : 19 And the basons , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
52 : 23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side ; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about .
how is she become as a widow !
1 : 11 All her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul : see , O LORD , and consider ; for I am become vile .
1 : 13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me desolate and faint all the day .
1 : 17 Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
1 : 19 I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
2 : 7 The LORD hath cast off his altar , he hath abhorred his sanctuary , he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces ; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD , as in the day of a solemn feast .
shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
3 : 21 This I recall to my mind , therefore have I hope .
3 : 22 It is of the LORD ' s mercies that we are not consumed , because his compassions fail not .
3 : 24 The LORD is my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will I hope in him .
3 : 37 Who is he that saith , and it cometh to pass , when the Lord commandeth it not ?
3 : 47 Fear and a snare is come upon us , desolation and destruction .
3 : 49 Mine eye trickleth down , and ceaseth not , without any intermission .
4 : 1 How is the gold become dim !
the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street .
4 : 7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk , they were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was of sapphire : 4 : 8 Their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cleaveth to their bones ; it is withered , it is become like a stick .
4 : 12 The kings of the earth , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem .
4 : 13 For the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her , 4 : 14 They have wandered as blind men in the streets , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
4 : 15 They cried unto them , Depart ye ; it is unclean ; depart , depart , touch not : when they fled away and wandered , they said among the heathen , They shall no more sojourn there .
5 : 5 Our necks are under persecution : we labour , and have no rest .
5 : 7 Our fathers have sinned , and are not ; and we have borne their iniquities .
5 : 13 They took the young men to grind , and the children fell under the wood .
5 : 14 The elders have ceased from the gate , the young men from their musick .
5 : 15 The joy of our heart is ceased ; our dance is turned into mourning .
1 : 2 In the fifth day of the month , which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin ' s captivity , 1 : 3 The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar ; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him .
1 : 6 And every one had four faces , and every one had four wings .
2 : 8 But thou , son of man , hear what I say unto thee ; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house : open thy mouth , and eat that I give thee .
2 : 9 And when I looked , behold , an hand was sent unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ; 2 : 10 And he spread it before me ; and it was written within and without : and there was written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
3 : 1 Moreover he said unto me , Son of man , eat that thou findest ; eat this roll , and go speak unto the house of Israel .
3 : 5 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language , but to the house of Israel ; 3 : 6 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not understand .
3 : 7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee ; for they will not hearken unto me : for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted .
3 : 14 So the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me .
3 : 22 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me ; and he said unto me , Arise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with thee .
3 : 23 Then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the LORD stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
3 : 24 Then the spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet , and spake with me , and said unto me , Go , shut thyself within thine house .
3 : 27 But when I speak with thee , I will open thy mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; He that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
4 : 1 Thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and pourtray upon it the city , even Jerusalem : 4 : 2 And lay siege against it , and build a fort against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set battering rams against it round about .
4 : 8 And , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
4 : 13 And the LORD said , Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles , whither I will drive them .
5 : 10 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
5 : 11 Wherefore , as I live , saith the Lord GOD ; Surely , because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things , and with all thine abominations , therefore will I also diminish thee ; neither shall mine eye spare , neither will I have any pity .
5 : 13 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause my fury to rest upon them , and I will be comforted : and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal , when I have accomplished my fury in them .
6 : 7 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
6 : 13 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD , when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars , upon every high hill , in all the tops of the mountains , and under every green tree , and under every thick oak , the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols .
7 : 5 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; An evil , an only evil , behold , is come .
7 : 22 My face will I turn also from them , and they shall pollute my secret place : for the robbers shall enter into it , and defile it .
7 : 23 Make a chain : for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
8 : 1 And it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me .
8 : 5 Then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north .
Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house .
9 : 7 And he said unto them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain : go ye forth .
And they went forth , and slew in the city .
9 : 8 And it came to pass , while they were slaying them , and I was left , that I fell upon my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord GOD !
9 : 10 And as for me also , mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will recompense their way upon their head .
10 : 6 And it came to pass , that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen , saying , Take fire from between the wheels , from between the cherubims ; then he went in , and stood beside the wheels .
10 : 10 And as for their appearances , they four had one likeness , as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel .
10 : 14 And every one had four faces : the first face was the face of a cherub , and the second face was the face of a man , and the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of an eagle .
11 : 2 Then said he unto me , Son of man , these are the men that devise mischief , and give wicked counsel in this city : 11 : 3 Which say , It is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the caldron , and we be the flesh .
11 : 14 Again the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 11 : 15 Son of man , thy brethren , even thy brethren , the men of thy kindred , and all the house of Israel wholly , are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said , Get you far from the LORD : unto us is this land given in possession .
So the vision that I had seen went up from me .
12 : 8 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me , saying , 12 : 9 Son of man , hath not the house of Israel , the rebellious house , said unto thee , What doest thou ?
12 : 20 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be desolate ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
13 : 7 Have ye not seen a vain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying divination , whereas ye say , The LORD saith it ; albeit I have not spoken ?
13 : 9 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity , and that divine lies : they shall not be in the assembly of my people , neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel , neither shall they enter into the land of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
13 : 12 Lo , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said unto you , Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it ?
13 : 17 Likewise , thou son of man , set thy face against the daughters of thy people , which prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy thou against them , 13 : 18 And say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes , and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls !
13 : 21 Your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
14 : 2 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 14 : 3 Son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face : should I be enquired of at all by them ?
14 : 4 Therefore speak unto them , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart , and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face , and cometh to the prophet ; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols ; 14 : 5 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
16 : 6 And when I passed by thee , and saw thee polluted in thine own blood , I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , Live ; yea , I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , Live .
16 : 17 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them , 16 : 18 And tookest thy broidered garments , and coveredst them : and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them .
16 : 19 My meat also which I gave thee , fine flour , and oil , and honey , wherewith I fed thee , thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour : and thus it was , saith the Lord GOD .
16 : 30 How weak is thine heart , saith the LORD GOD , seeing thou doest all these things , the work of an imperious whorish woman ; 16 : 31 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire ; 16 : 32 But as a wife that committeth adultery , which taketh strangers instead of her husband !
16 : 33 They give gifts to all whores : but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers , and hirest them , that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom .
16 : 38 And I will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
16 : 39 And I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place , and shall break down thy high places : they shall strip thee also of thy clothes , and shall take thy fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
16 : 46 And thine elder sister is Samaria , she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand : and thy younger sister , that dwelleth at thy right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
16 : 48 As I live , saith the Lord GOD , Sodom thy sister hath not done , she nor her daughters , as thou hast done , thou and thy daughters .
16 : 51 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins ; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they , and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done .
16 : 53 When I shall bring again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them : 16 : 54 That thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them .
16 : 59 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done , which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
17 : 21 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds : and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it .
18 : 10 If he beget a son that is a robber , a shedder of blood , and that doeth the like to any one of these things , 18 : 11 And that doeth not any of those duties , but even hath eaten upon the mountains , and defiled his neighbour ' s wife , 18 : 12 Hath oppressed the poor and needy , hath spoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , hath committed abomination , 18 : 13 Hath given forth upon usury , and hath taken increase : shall he then live ?
saith the Lord GOD : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
18 : 27 Again , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
O house of Israel , are not my ways equal ?
19 : 8 Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces , and spread their net over him : he was taken in their pit .
19 : 9 And they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
As I live , saith the Lord GOD , I will not be enquired of by you .
20 : 25 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good , and judgments whereby they should not live ; 20 : 26 And I polluted them in their own gifts , in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb , that I might make them desolate , to the end that they might know that I am the LORD .
20 : 29 Then I said unto them , What is the high place whereunto ye go ?
20 : 30 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers ?
20 : 45 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 20 : 46 Son of man , set thy face toward the south , and drop thy word toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the south field ; 20 : 47 And say to the forest of the south , Hear the word of the LORD ; Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will kindle a fire in thee , and it shall devour every green tree in thee , and every dry tree : the flaming flame shall not be quenched , and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein .
21 : 4 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north : 21 : 5 That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath : it shall not return any more .
21 : 6 Sigh therefore , thou son of man , with the breaking of thy loins ; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes .
21 : 12 Cry and howl , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the princes of Israel : terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : smite therefore upon thy thigh .
21 : 13 Because it is a trial , and what if the sword contemn even the rod ?
21 : 31 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
22 : 6 Behold , the princes of Israel , every one were in thee to their power to shed blood .
22 : 22 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you .
Thus were their names ; Samaria is Aholah , and Jerusalem Aholibah .
23 : 17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their whoredom , and she was polluted with them , and her mind was alienated from them .
23 : 30 I will do these things unto thee , because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen , and because thou art polluted with their idols .
23 : 36 The LORD said moreover unto me ; Son of man , wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah ?
23 : 38 Moreover this they have done unto me : they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day , and have profaned my sabbaths .
23 : 45 And the righteous men , they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
23 : 46 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will bring up a company upon them , and will give them to be removed and spoiled .
23 : 49 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you , and ye shall bear the sins of your idols : and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
24 : 3 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it : 24 : 4 Gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
24 : 9 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Woe to the bloody city !
24 : 12 She hath wearied herself with lies , and her great scum went not forth out of her : her scum shall be in the fire .
24 : 22 And ye shall do as I have done : ye shall not cover your lips , nor eat the bread of men .
25 : 15 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge , and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart , to destroy it for the old hatred ; 25 : 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethims , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
26 : 8 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the buckler against thee .
26 : 18 Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure .
27 : 6 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory , brought out of the isles of Chittim .
27 : 10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
27 : 13 Javan , Tubal , and Meshech , they were thy merchants : they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market .
27 : 19 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs : bright iron , cassia , and calamus , were in thy market .
27 : 27 Thy riches , and thy fairs , thy merchandise , thy mariners , and thy pilots , thy calkers , and the occupiers of thy merchandise , and all thy men of war , that are in thee , and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee , shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin .
29 : 13 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD ; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered : 29 : 14 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their habitation ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
29 : 15 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
30 : 5 Ethiopia , and Libya , and Lydia , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
30 : 12 And I will make the rivers dry , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked : and I will make the land waste , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I the LORD have spoken it .
30 : 13 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
30 : 15 And I will pour my fury upon Sin , the strength of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
30 : 22 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
31 : 3 Behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
31 : 7 Thus was he fair in his greatness , in the length of his branches : for his root was by great waters .
32 : 4 Then will I leave thee upon the land , I will cast thee forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee , and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee .
32 : 13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them .
32 : 14 Then will I make their waters deep , and cause their rivers to run like oil , saith the Lord GOD .
go down , and be thou laid with the uncircumcised .
32 : 28 Yea , thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword .
32 : 32 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living : and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword , even Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord GOD .
33 : 6 But if the watchman see the sword come , and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warned ; if the sword come , and take any person from among them , he is taken away in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at the watchman ' s hand .
33 : 14 Again , when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ; 33 : 15 If the wicked restore the pledge , give again that he had robbed , walk in the statutes of life , without committing iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
33 : 16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him : he hath done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
33 : 33 And when this cometh to pass , ( lo , it will come ,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them .
should not the shepherds feed the flocks ?
and to have drunk of the deep waters , but ye must foul the residue with your feet ?
34 : 20 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them ; Behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
34 : 30 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them , and that they , even the house of Israel , are my people , saith the Lord GOD .
35 : 14 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; When the whole earth rejoiceth , I will make thee desolate .
36 : 16 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 36 : 17 Son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
36 : 22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel , thus saith the Lord GOD ; I do not this for your sakes , O house of Israel , but for mine holy name ' s sake , which ye have profaned among the heathen , whither ye went .
36 : 23 And I will sanctify my great name , which was profaned among the heathen , which ye have profaned in the midst of them ; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD , saith the Lord GOD , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
36 : 26 A new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you an heart of flesh .
36 : 31 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
36 : 34 And the desolate land shall be tilled , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by .
37 : 13 And ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves , 37 : 14 And shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it , and performed it , saith the LORD .
37 : 28 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore .
38 : 8 After many days thou shalt be visited : in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword , and is gathered out of many people , against the mountains of Israel , which have been always waste : but it is brought forth out of the nations , and they shall dwell safely all of them .
38 : 14 Therefore , son of man , prophesy and say unto Gog , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely , shalt thou not know it ?
38 : 15 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts , thou , and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company , and a mighty army : 38 : 16 And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel , as a cloud to cover the land ; it shall be in the latter days , and I will bring thee against my land , that the heathen may know me , when I shall be sanctified in thee , O Gog , before their eyes .
39 : 22 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward .
40 : 24 After that he brought me toward the south , and behold a gate toward the south : and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures .
40 : 27 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits .
40 : 40 And at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
40 : 46 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi , which come near to the LORD to minister unto him .
40 : 49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits , and the breadth eleven cubits , and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it : and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and another on that side .
41 : 6 And the side chambers were three , one over another , and thirty in order ; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about , that they might have hold , but they had not hold in the wall of the house .
41 : 11 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about .
42 : 4 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors toward the north .
43 : 5 So the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house .
43 : 9 Now let them put away their whoredom , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
Behold , this is the law of the house .
43 : 19 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok , which approach unto me , to minister unto me , saith the Lord GOD , a young bullock for a sin offering .
44 : 8 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
44 : 21 Neither shall any priest drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
44 : 22 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow that had a priest before .
44 : 27 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary , unto the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , saith the Lord GOD .
44 : 28 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance : I am their inheritance : and ye shall give them no possession in Israel : I am their possession .
45 : 10 Ye shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath .
46 : 8 And when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way thereof .
46 : 11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock , and an ephah to a ram , and to the lambs as he is able to give , and an hin of oil to an ephah .
46 : 15 Thus shall they prepare the lamb , and the meat offering , and the oil , every morning for a continual burnt offering .
46 : 20 Then said he unto me , This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering , where they shall bake the meat offering ; that they bear them not out into the utter court , to sanctify the people .
46 : 22 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad : these four corners were of one measure .
47 : 1 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house ; and , behold , waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward : for the forefront of the house stood toward the east , and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house , at the south side of the altar .
47 : 9 And it shall come to pass , that every thing that liveth , which moveth , whithersoever the rivers shall come , shall live : and there shall be a very great multitude of fish , because these waters shall come thither : for they shall be healed ; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh .
47 : 12 And by the river upon the bank thereof , on this side and on that side , shall grow all trees for meat , whose leaf shall not fade , neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed : it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months , because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary : and the fruit thereof shall be for meat , and the leaf thereof for medicine .
47 : 21 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel .
48 : 2 And by the border of Dan , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Asher .
48 : 13 And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
48 : 19 And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel .
48 : 20 All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand : ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare , with the possession of the city .
48 : 24 And by the border of Benjamin , from the east side unto the west side , Simeon shall have a portion .
48 : 26 And by the border of Issachar , from the east side unto the west side , Zebulun a portion .
48 : 28 And by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh , and to the river toward the great sea .
48 : 30 And these are the goings out of the city on the north side , four thousand and five hundred measures .
48 : 32 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
1 : 2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God : which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
1 : 5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king ' s meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
1 : 15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king ' s meat .
1 : 17 As for these four children , God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
1 : 19 And the king communed with them ; and among them all was found none like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah : therefore stood they before the king .
2 : 16 Then Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would give him time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation .
2 : 25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste , and said thus unto him , I have found a man of the captives of Judah , that will make known unto the king the interpretation .
2 : 35 Then was the iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold , broken to pieces together , and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors ; and the wind carried them away , that no place was found for them : and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain , and filled the whole earth .
2 : 40 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
2 : 45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands , and that it brake in pieces the iron , the brass , the clay , the silver , and the gold ; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter : and the dream is certain , and the interpretation thereof sure .
2 : 48 Then the king made Daniel a great man , and gave him many great gifts , and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon , and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon .
3 : 8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near , and accused the Jews .
Then they brought these men before the king .
3 : 18 But if not , be it known unto thee , O king , that we will not serve thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up .
3 : 28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake , and said , Blessed be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , who hath sent his angel , and delivered his servants that trusted in him , and have changed the king ' s word , and yielded their bodies , that they might not serve nor worship any god , except their own God .
4 : 3 How great are his signs !
4 : 27 Wherefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sins by righteousness , and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor ; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity .
4 : 32 And they shall drive thee from men , and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field : they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen , and seven times shall pass over thee , until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will .
5 : 7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers .
5 : 20 But when his heart was lifted up , and his mind hardened in pride , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him : 5 : 21 And he was driven from the sons of men ; and his heart was made like the beasts , and his dwelling was with the wild asses : they fed him with grass like oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven ; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men , and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will .
5 : 27 TEKEL ; Thou art weighed in the balances , and art found wanting .
6 : 12 Then they came near , and spake before the king concerning the king ' s decree ; Hast thou not signed a decree , that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days , save of thee , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions ?
6 : 14 Then the king , when he heard these words , was sore displeased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
6 : 16 Then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions .
7 : 2 Daniel spake and said , I saw in my vision by night , and , behold , the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea .
7 : 15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
So he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
7 : 24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three kings .
7 : 27 And the kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven , shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High , whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey him .
8 : 3 Then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
8 : 6 And he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .

2 : 9 Therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness .
4 : 10 For they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the LORD .

8 : 26 And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ?
And when they were come out , they went into the herd of swine : and , behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea , and perished in the waters .
8 : 34 And , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
9 : 6 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy ,) Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
9 : 12 But when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
9 : 19 And Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
9 : 28 And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ?
9 : 29 Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it unto you .
10 : 5 These twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not : 10 : 6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
10 : 15 Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
10 : 20 For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
10 : 23 But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
11 : 1 And it came to pass , when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
11 : 7 And as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ?
behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
12 : 11 And he said unto them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
12 : 12 How much then is a man better than a sheep ?
12 : 13 Then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand .
and then he will spoil his house .
12 : 30 He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
12 : 36 But I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
12 : 44 Then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
13 : 1 The same day went Jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
13 : 10 And the disciples came , and said unto him , Why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
13 : 14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive : 13 : 15 For this people ' s heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
13 : 29 But he said , Nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
13 : 31 Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field : 13 : 32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
13 : 33 Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
13 : 37 He answered and said unto them , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ; 13 : 38 The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ; 13 : 39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
13 : 55 Is not this the carpenter ' s son ?
14 : 8 And she , being before instructed of her mother , said , Give me here John Baptist ' s head in a charger .
14 : 13 When Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
14 : 22 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
And when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus .
14 : 31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said unto him , O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
15 : 1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees , which were of Jerusalem , saying , 15 : 2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ?
15 : 5 But ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ; 15 : 6 And honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free .
15 : 27 And she said , Truth , Lord : yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table .
And her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
15 : 34 And Jesus saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ?
And he left them , and departed .
16 : 6 Then Jesus said unto them , Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
16 : 8 Which when Jesus perceived , he said unto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
16 : 14 And they said , Some say that thou art John the Baptist : some , Elias ; and others , Jeremias , or one of the prophets .
16 : 18 And I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
16 : 22 Then Peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , Be it far from thee , Lord : this shall not be unto thee .
16 : 25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
16 : 28 Verily I say unto you , There be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
17 : 5 While he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
17 : 6 And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
17 : 13 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist .
17 : 16 And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
17 : 18 And Jesus rebuked the devil ; and he departed out of him : and the child was cured from that very hour .
17 : 24 And when they were come to Capernaum , they that received tribute money came to Peter , and said , Doth not your master pay tribute ?
18 : 5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me .
18 : 6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
18 : 8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire .
18 : 9 And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
18 : 12 How think ye ?
18 : 25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
18 : 28 But the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
18 : 30 And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt .
18 : 31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
18 : 32 Then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me : 18 : 33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant , even as I had pity on thee ?
19 : 9 And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
19 : 10 His disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
19 : 15 And he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
19 : 17 And he said unto him , Why callest thou me good ?
there is none good but one , that is , God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
19 : 29 And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name ' s sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
19 : 30 But many that are first shall be last ; and the last shall be first .
20 : 13 But he answered one of them , and said , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a penny ?
20 : 21 And he said unto her , What wilt thou ?
20 : 25 But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
20 : 31 And the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou son of David .
21 : 1 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem , and were come to Bethphage , unto the mount of Olives , then sent Jesus two disciples , 21 : 2 Saying unto them , Go into the village over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them unto me .
21 : 22 And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
21 : 26 But if we shall say , Of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold John as a prophet .
21 : 31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father ?
22 : 4 Again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
22 : 10 So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
22 : 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
22 : 35 Then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying , 22 : 36 Master , which is the great commandment in the law ?
23 : 11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
23 : 23 Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites !
for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
23 : 34 Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city : 23 : 35 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
23 : 38 Behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
24 : 3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ?
24 : 8 All these are the beginning of sorrows .
24 : 9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name ' s sake .
24 : 32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh : 24 : 33 So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
24 : 35 Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
24 : 46 Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
24 : 47 Verily I say unto you , That he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
25 : 5 While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
25 : 16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
25 : 34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world : 25 : 35 For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in : 25 : 36 Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
26 : 6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , 26 : 7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
26 : 14 Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests , 26 : 15 And said unto them , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you ?
26 : 17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
26 : 32 But after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee .
Likewise also said all the disciples .
26 : 37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
26 : 48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
They answered and said , He is guilty of death .
26 : 71 And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
27 : 11 And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
27 : 13 Then said Pilate unto him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
27 : 15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
27 : 29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews !
27 : 30 And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head .
27 : 33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull , 27 : 34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted thereof , he would not drink .
27 : 36 And sitting down they watched him there ; 27 : 37 And set up over his head his accusation written , THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
27 : 44 The thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth .
27 : 45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
27 : 55 And many women were there beholding afar off , which followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him : 27 : 56 Among which was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedees children .
27 : 62 Now the next day , that followed the day of the preparation , the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate , 27 : 63 Saying , Sir , we remember that that deceiver said , while he was yet alive , After three days I will rise again .
27 : 64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first .
Come , see the place where the Lord lay .
28 : 8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his disciples word .
28 : 12 And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers , 28 : 13 Saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
1 : 5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
1 : 6 And John was clothed with camel ' s hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ; 1 : 7 And preached , saying , There cometh one mightier than I after me , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
1 : 9 And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
1 : 13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
1 : 19 And when he had gone a little farther thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
1 : 23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out , 1 : 24 Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ?
1 : 25 And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
1 : 27 And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ?
1 : 30 But Simon ' s wife ' s mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
1 : 37 And when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
1 : 39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out devils .
And he arose and followed him .
2 : 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners , they said unto his disciples , How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ?
3 : 6 And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
3 : 31 There came then his brethren and his mother , and , standing without , sent unto him , calling him .
3 : 33 And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother , or my brethren ?
3 : 35 For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother .
4 : 13 And he said unto them , Know ye not this parable ?
4 : 15 And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
4 : 34 But without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples .
And there were also with him other little ships .
4 : 37 And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
5 : 9 And he asked him , What is thy name ?
5 : 11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding .
5 : 24 And Jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
5 : 38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
6 : 18 For John had said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ' s wife .
6 : 37 He answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat .
And immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid .
6 : 52 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was hardened .
7 : 2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
8 : 7 And they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
have ye your heart yet hardened ?
8 : 22 And he cometh to Bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man unto him , and besought him to touch him .
8 : 23 And he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
8 : 25 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
9 : 6 For he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
9 : 20 And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
9 : 24 And straightway the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , Lord , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
9 : 25 When Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
9 : 28 And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Why could not we cast him out ?
9 : 35 And he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
9 : 49 For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
10 : 10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
10 : 19 Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honour thy father and mother .
10 : 21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him , and said unto him , One thing thou lackest : go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , take up the cross , and follow me .
10 : 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words .
But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
10 : 27 And Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible .
10 : 29 And Jesus answered and said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel ' s , 10 : 30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
10 : 32 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid .
10 : 36 And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ?
10 : 37 They said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
10 : 39 And they said unto him , We can .
And Jesus said unto them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized : 10 : 40 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
10 : 50 And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
10 : 52 And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole .
11 : 1 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples , 11 : 2 And saith unto them , Go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him .
11 : 5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ?
11 : 15 And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ; 11 : 16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
11 : 17 And he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ?
11 : 21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , Master , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
11 : 25 And when ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have ought against any : that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
11 : 32 But if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
And Jesus answering saith unto them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
12 : 1 And he began to speak unto them by parables .
12 : 4 And again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
12 : 8 And they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
And they said unto him , Caesar ' s .
12 : 17 And Jesus answering said unto them , Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ' s , and to God the things that are God ' s .
12 : 18 Then come unto him the Sadducees , which say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying , 12 : 19 Master , Moses wrote unto us , If a man ' s brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
12 : 36 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The LORD said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
13 : 1 And as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples saith unto him , Master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here !
13 : 23 But take ye heed : behold , I have foretold you all things .
13 : 34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
14 : 7 For ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
14 : 8 She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
14 : 9 Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
14 : 10 And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
14 : 12 And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
14 : 43 And immediately , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
14 : 54 And Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
what is it which these witness against thee ?
14 : 63 Then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What need we any further witnesses ?
14 : 65 And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
And when he thought thereon , he wept .
15 : 8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
15 : 19 And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
15 : 29 And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ah , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , 15 : 30 Save thyself , and come down from the cross .
16 : 1 And when the sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him .
16 : 9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven devils .
16 : 15 And he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
1 : 5 THERE was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
1 : 23 And it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
1 : 46 And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord , 1 : 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour .
1 : 66 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be !
1 : 80 And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel .
2 : 3 And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
2 : 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
2 : 10 And the angel said unto them , Fear not : for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people .
2 : 20 And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
2 : 36 And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ; 2 : 37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
2 : 39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
3 : 5 Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ; 3 : 6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
3 : 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
3 : 9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
3 : 14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ?
3 : 15 And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ; 3 : 16 John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire : 3 : 17 Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
3 : 19 But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip ' s wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done , 3 : 20 Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
And in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
4 : 20 And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down .
4 : 22 And all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth .
4 : 28 And all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath , 4 : 29 And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
And when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
And Simon ' s wife ' s mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
4 : 43 And he said unto them , I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also : for therefore am I sent .
5 : 3 And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon ' s , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land .
5 : 5 And Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
5 : 16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
Who can forgive sins , but God alone ?
5 : 34 And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
5 : 38 But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .
6 : 6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
6 : 12 And it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
6 : 17 And he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ; 6 : 18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
6 : 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all .
6 : 23 Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
6 : 30 Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
6 : 32 For if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ?
for sinners also do even the same .
6 : 43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
7 : 3 And when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
7 : 9 When Jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
7 : 12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
7 : 18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things .
7 : 22 Then Jesus answering said unto them , Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached .
Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
7 : 29 And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
7 : 32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
7 : 36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him .
7 : 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
8 : 10 And he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
8 : 11 Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
8 : 14 And that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
8 : 24 And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish .
8 : 27 And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
8 : 45 And Jesus said , Who touched me ?
8 : 46 And Jesus said , Somebody hath touched me : for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me .
8 : 52 And all wept , and bewailed her : but he said , Weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth .
9 : 2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
And they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
9 : 24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
9 : 33 And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
9 : 38 And , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
9 : 40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not .
9 : 42 And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him .
9 : 47 And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him , 9 : 48 And said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great .
9 : 49 And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us .
9 : 50 And Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us .
9 : 53 And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
9 : 58 And Jesus said unto him , Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
9 : 60 Jesus said unto him , Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of God .
9 : 62 And Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .
10 : 4 Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
Go not from house to house .
for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
10 : 25 And , behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
10 : 31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
Then said Jesus unto him , Go , and do thou likewise .
10 : 38 Now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
10 : 39 And she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
10 : 41 And Jesus answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things : 10 : 42 But one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
11 : 43 Woe unto you , Pharisees !
11 : 46 And he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers !
for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
11 : 52 Woe unto you , lawyers !
12 : 13 And one of the company said unto him , Master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me .
12 : 19 And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
12 : 26 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
12 : 38 And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
12 : 53 The father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
13 : 4 Or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem ?
13 : 16 And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
13 : 23 Then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that be saved ?
13 : 29 And they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
13 : 32 And he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
14 : 1 And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
14 : 2 And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
14 : 19 And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused .
14 : 21 So that servant came , and shewed his lord these things .
14 : 23 And the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
14 : 32 Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
14 : 33 So likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he cannot be my disciple .
15 : 9 And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , Rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
15 : 16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
15 : 18 I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee , 15 : 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
15 : 31 And he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine .
15 : 32 It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
16 : 3 Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ?
16 : 10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
16 : 27 Then he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ' s house : 16 : 28 For I have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
16 : 29 Abraham saith unto him , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
17 : 3 Take heed to yourselves : If thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
17 : 4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
And it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
but where are the nine ?
17 : 28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ; 17 : 29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
17 : 33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
18 : 13 And the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner .
18 : 20 Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother .
18 : 24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
19 : 3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature .
19 : 15 And it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
19 : 16 Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
19 : 26 For I say unto you , That unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
19 : 31 And if any man ask you , Why do ye loose him ?
19 : 34 And they said , The Lord hath need of him .
What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
20 : 16 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others .
20 : 40 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all .
20 : 45 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples , 20 : 46 Beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ; 20 : 47 Which devour widows ' houses , and for a shew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation .
21 : 3 And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all : 21 : 4 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
21 : 24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
22 : 1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover .
22 : 12 And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
but I am among you as he that serveth .
22 : 35 And he said unto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ?
22 : 39 And he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
22 : 45 And when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow , 22 : 46 And said unto them , Why sleep ye ?
22 : 48 But Jesus said unto him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ?
22 : 49 When they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
22 : 50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
22 : 51 And Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye thus far .
22 : 69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God .
22 : 71 And they said , What need we any further witness ?
23 : 4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people , I find no fault in this man .
23 : 11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
And they parted his raiment , and cast lots .
And the rulers also with them derided him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if he be Christ , the chosen of God .
23 : 50 And , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counsellor ; and he was a good man , and a just : 23 : 51 ( The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ;) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
23 : 52 This man went unto Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus .
24 : 10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
24 : 16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
24 : 19 And he said unto them , What things ?
24 : 24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
24 : 31 And their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
24 : 33 And they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them , 24 : 34 Saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
24 : 38 And he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ?
24 : 40 And when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
24 : 43 And he took it , and did eat before them .
24 : 50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
1 : 3 All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
1 : 5 And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
What sayest thou of thyself ?
1 : 26 John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ; 1 : 27 He it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe ' s latchet I am not worthy to unloose .
1 : 41 He first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
thou shalt see greater things than these .
2 : 1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there : 2 : 2 And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
2 : 6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
2 : 14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting : 2 : 15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ; 2 : 16 And said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father ' s house an house of merchandise .
3 : 9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him , How can these things be ?
3 : 30 He must increase , but I must decrease .
3 : 32 And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
4 : 16 Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither .
Jesus said unto her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband : 4 : 18 For thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly .
4 : 19 The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
4 : 27 And upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou ?
or , Why talkest thou with her ?
4 : 30 Then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest .
4 : 45 Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
4 : 49 The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die .
5 : 9 And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
5 : 13 And he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
5 : 32 There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
5 : 42 But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
5 : 44 How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ?
6 : 3 And Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
6 : 14 Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
6 : 22 The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ; 6 : 23 ( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks :) 6 : 24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
6 : 31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
6 : 48 I am that bread of life .
6 : 50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
6 : 52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
6 : 53 Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
6 : 54 Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
6 : 62 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ?
If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
7 : 9 When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
7 : 15 And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
7 : 20 The people answered and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
7 : 27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
7 : 28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
7 : 38 He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
7 : 40 Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , Of a truth this is the Prophet .
7 : 46 The officers answered , Never man spake like this man .
7 : 48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ?
Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet .
But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
8 : 17 It is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true .
8 : 23 And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
8 : 24 I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
8 : 27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
8 : 28 Then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
8 : 33 They answered him , We be Abraham ' s seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
8 : 37 I know that ye are Abraham ' s seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
8 : 44 Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do .
8 : 48 Then answered the Jews , and said unto him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a devil ?
9 : 4 I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
9 : 5 As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
9 : 8 The neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ?
9 : 17 They say unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ?
9 : 20 His parents answered them and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind : 9 : 21 But by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
10 : 5 And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
10 : 8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
10 : 11 I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
10 : 14 I am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known of mine .
10 : 19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings .
10 : 23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon ' s porch .
10 : 25 Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I do in my Father ' s name , they bear witness of me .
11 : 3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
11 : 9 Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ?
11 : 23 Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again .
11 : 34 And said , Where have ye laid him ?
Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
11 : 56 Then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ?
12 : 10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ; 12 : 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
12 : 17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
12 : 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ?
12 : 22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus .
12 : 27 Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ?
13 : 13 Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am .
13 : 15 For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
13 : 23 Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
13 : 25 He then lying on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ?
13 : 35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
13 : 36 Simon Peter said unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ?
13 : 38 Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ?
14 : 6 Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me .
14 : 9 Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me , Philip ?
14 : 28 Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you .
Arise , let us go hence .
15 : 2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
15 : 6 If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
15 : 10 If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father ' s commandments , and abide in his love .
15 : 11 These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
15 : 17 These things I command you , that ye love one another .
16 : 6 But because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
16 : 8 And when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment : 16 : 9 Of sin , because they believe not on me ; 16 : 10 Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ; 16 : 11 Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
16 : 12 I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye cannot bear them now .
16 : 14 He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
16 : 17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ?
16 : 19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
16 : 21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
16 : 24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
17 : 4 I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
17 : 8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
Jesus saith unto them , I am he .
18 : 8 Jesus answered , I have told you that I am he : if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way : 18 : 9 That the saying might be fulfilled , which he spake , Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none .
18 : 11 Then said Jesus unto Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
18 : 12 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him , 18 : 13 And led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
18 : 16 But Peter stood at the door without .
Then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
18 : 25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself .
He denied it , and said , I am not .
18 : 40 Then cried they all again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas .
And Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man !
And they took Jesus , and led him away .
19 : 17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha : 19 : 18 Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
These things therefore the soldiers did .
He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
20 : 3 Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
20 : 13 And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ?
20 : 16 Jesus saith unto her , Mary .
20 : 26 And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
21 : 3 Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing .
They say unto him , We also go with thee .
21 : 4 But when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
And none of the disciples durst ask him , Who art thou ?
He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee .
Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , Lovest thou me ?
21 : 22 Jesus saith unto him , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ?
follow thou me .
The Acts of the Apostles
1 : 9 And when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
1 : 10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up , behold , two men stood by them in white apparel ; 1 : 11 Which also said , Ye men of Galilee , why stand ye gazing up into heaven ?
this same Jesus , which is taken up from you into heaven , shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
1 : 12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day ' s journey .
1 : 13 And when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon Zelotes , and Judas the brother of James .
1 : 18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out .
1 : 26 And they gave forth their lots ; and the lot fell upon Matthias ; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
2 : 9 Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia , and in Judaea , and Cappadocia , in Pontus , and Asia , 2 : 10 Phrygia , and Pamphylia , in Egypt , and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene , and strangers of Rome , Jews and proselytes , 2 : 11 Cretes and Arabians , we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God .
2 : 28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance .
3 : 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God : 3 : 10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him .
3 : 13 The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , hath glorified his Son Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of Pilate , when he was determined to let him go .
4 : 12 Neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved .
4 : 33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
4 : 34 Neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold , 4 : 35 And laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
5 : 5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down , and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
behold , the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door , and shall carry thee out .
5 : 13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them : but the people magnified them .
5 : 15 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets , and laid them on beds and couches , that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them .
5 : 16 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem , bringing sick folks , and them which were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man ' s blood upon us .
5 : 32 And we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the Holy Ghost , whom God hath given to them that obey him .
5 : 33 When they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took counsel to slay them .
5 : 37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
6 : 12 And they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council , 6 : 13 And set up false witnesses , which said , This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place , and the law : 6 : 14 For we have heard him say , that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us .
7 : 6 And God spake on this wise , That his seed should sojourn in a strange land ; and that they should bring them into bondage , and entreat them evil four hundred years .
7 : 11 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan , and great affliction : and our fathers found no sustenance .
7 : 26 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
7 : 34 I have seen , I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their groaning , and am come down to deliver them .
And now come , I will send thee into Egypt .
the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
7 : 36 He brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
8 : 4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word .
8 : 8 And there was great joy in that city .
8 : 13 Then Simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized , he continued with Philip , and wondered , beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
8 : 23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity .
8 : 29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip , Go near , and join thyself to this chariot .
8 : 31 And he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ?
And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
of himself , or of some other man ?
8 : 37 And Philip said , If thou believest with all thine heart , thou mayest .
9 : 5 And he said , Who art thou , Lord ?
9 : 8 And Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
9 : 10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , Ananias .
9 : 11 And the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the street which is called Straight , and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul , of Tarsus : for , behold , he prayeth , 9 : 12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receive his sight .
Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
9 : 29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
And he arose immediately .
9 : 41 And he gave her his hand , and lifted her up , and when he had called the saints and widows , presented her alive .
9 : 42 And it was known throughout all Joppa ; and many believed in the Lord .
10 : 24 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea .
10 : 32 Send therefore to Joppa , and call hither Simon , whose surname is Peter ; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side : who , when he cometh , shall speak unto thee .
Now therefore are we all here present before God , to hear all things that are commanded thee of God .
Then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
11 : 12 And the Spirit bade me go with them , nothing doubting .
11 : 17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us , who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ ; what was I , that I could withstand God ?
12 : 4 And when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
12 : 5 Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him .
12 : 6 And when Herod would have brought him forth , the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
12 : 15 And they said unto her , Thou art mad .
But she constantly affirmed that it was even so .
Then said they , It is his angel .
12 : 23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
13 : 4 So they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
13 : 13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos , they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem .
13 : 14 But when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
I am not he .
13 : 36 For David , after he had served his own generation by the will of God , fell on sleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption : 13 : 37 But he , whom God raised again , saw no corruption .
13 : 43 Now when the congregation was broken up , many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas : who , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of God .
14 : 8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra , impotent in his feet , being a cripple from his mother ' s womb , who never had walked : 14 : 9 The same heard Paul speak : who stedfastly beholding him , and perceiving that he had faith to be healed , 14 : 10 Said with a loud voice , Stand upright on thy feet .
14 : 12 And they called Barnabas , Jupiter ; and Paul , Mercurius , because he was the chief speaker .
14 : 20 Howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
15 : 3 And being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
15 : 21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him , being read in the synagogues every sabbath day .
15 : 39 And the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so Barnabas took Mark , and sailed unto Cyprus ; 15 : 40 And Paul chose Silas , and departed , being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God .
15 : 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia , confirming the churches .
16 : 4 And as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decrees for to keep , that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem .
16 : 18 And this did she many days .
But Paul , being grieved , turned and said to the spirit , I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her .
16 : 19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers , 16 : 20 And brought them to the magistrates , saying , These men , being Jews , do exceedingly trouble our city , 16 : 21 And teach customs , which are not lawful for us to receive , neither to observe , being Romans .
16 : 25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed , and sang praises unto God : and the prisoners heard them .
17 : 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
17 : 30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent : 17 : 31 Because he hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
17 : 33 So Paul departed from among them .
18 : 3 And because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
18 : 17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat .
18 : 20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them , he consented not ; 18 : 21 But bade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem : but I will return again unto you , if God will .
18 : 23 And after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
18 : 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard , they took him unto them , and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly .
And they said unto him , We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost .
19 : 8 And he went into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God .
19 : 9 But when divers were hardened , and believed not , but spake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus .
19 : 20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed .
19 : 29 And the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul ' s companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
And Alexander beckoned with the hand , and would have made his defence unto the people .
19 : 35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people , he said , Ye men of Ephesus , what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana , and of the image which fell down from Jupiter ?
19 : 37 For ye have brought hither these men , which are neither robbers of churches , nor yet blasphemers of your goddess .
20 : 1 And after the uproar was ceased , Paul called unto him the disciples , and embraced them , and departed for to go into Macedonia .
20 : 9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus , being fallen into a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third loft , and was taken up dead .
21 : 13 Then Paul answered , What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart ?
21 : 14 And when he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , The will of the Lord be done .
21 : 15 And after those days we took up our carriages , and went up to Jerusalem .
21 : 18 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James ; and all the elders were present .
21 : 30 And all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took Paul , and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
22 : 8 And I answered , Who art thou , Lord ?
arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on the name of the Lord .
22 : 19 And I said , Lord , they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee : 22 : 20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting unto his death , and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
He said , Yea .
23 : 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit : but the Pharisees confess both .
23 : 13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy .
23 : 18 So he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
23 : 30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him .
24 : 23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
24 : 27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix ' room : and Felix , willing to shew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound .
25 : 5 Let them therefore , said he , which among you are able , go down with me , and accuse this man , if there be any wickedness in him .
25 : 10 Then said Paul , I stand at Caesar ' s judgment seat , where I ought to be judged : to the Jews have I done no wrong , as thou very well knowest .
25 : 22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus , I would also hear the man myself .
25 : 24 And Festus said , King Agrippa , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
Then Paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself : 26 : 2 I think myself happy , king Agrippa , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews : 26 : 3 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently .
26 : 4 My manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem , know all the Jews ; 26 : 5 Which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
For which hope ' s sake , king Agrippa , I am accused of the Jews .
it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
26 : 25 But he said , I am not mad , most noble Festus ; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness .
26 : 26 For the king knoweth of these things , before whom also I speak freely : for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a corner .
26 : 29 And Paul said , I would to God , that not only thou , but also all that hear me this day , were both almost , and altogether such as I am , except these bonds .
27 : 2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
27 : 6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy ; and he put us therein .
27 : 11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by Paul .
27 : 12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in , the more part advised to depart thence also , if by any means they might attain to Phenice , and there to winter ; which is an haven of Crete , and lieth toward the south west and north west .
27 : 22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man ' s life among you , but of the ship .
27 : 23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God , whose I am , and whom I serve , 27 : 24 Saying , Fear not , Paul ; thou must be brought before Caesar : and , lo , God hath given thee all them that sail with thee .
And so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
28 : 4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffereth not to live .
28 : 5 And he shook off the beast into the fire , and felt no harm .
28 : 20 For this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .
1 : 13 Now I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you , ( but was let hitherto ,) that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
1 : 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature : 1 : 27 And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
1 : 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ; 1 : 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , debate , deceit , malignity ; whisperers , 1 : 30 Backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents , 1 : 31 Without understanding , covenantbreakers , without natural affection , implacable , unmerciful : 1 : 32 Who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
2 : 4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
2 : 14 For when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves : 2 : 15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another ;) 2 : 16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel .
thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
2 : 23 Thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou God ?
2 : 24 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you , as it is written .
2 : 27 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
3 : 4 God forbid : yea , let God be true , but every man a liar ; as it is written , That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings , and mightest overcome when thou art judged .
Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance ?
3 : 8 And not rather , ( as we be slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ,) Let us do evil , that good may come ?
are we better than they ?
3 : 29 Is he the God of the Jews only ?
3 : 31 Do we then make void the law through faith ?
4 : 5 But to him that worketh not , but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness .
4 : 23 Now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him ; 4 : 24 But for us also , to whom it shall be imputed , if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ; 4 : 25 Who was delivered for our offences , and was raised again for our justification .
5 : 3 And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ; 5 : 4 And patience , experience ; and experience , hope : 5 : 5 And hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us .
5 : 6 For when we were yet without strength , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
5 : 12 Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned : 5 : 13 ( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
5 : 19 For as by one man ' s disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
6 : 2 God forbid .
shall we sin , because we are not under the law , but under grace ?
6 : 16 Know ye not , that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey , his servants ye are to whom ye obey ; whether of sin unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
Nay , I had not known sin , but by the law : for I had not known lust , except the law had said , Thou shalt not covet .
7 : 8 But sin , taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence .
7 : 18 For I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh ,) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
8 : 3 For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh : 8 : 4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
8 : 12 Therefore , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
8 : 20 For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope , 8 : 21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
8 : 38 For I am persuaded , that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come , 8 : 39 Nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
9 : 29 And as Esaias said before , Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed , we had been as Sodoma , and been made like unto Gomorrha .
9 : 30 What shall we say then ?
10 : 1 Brethren , my heart ' s desire and prayer to God for Israel is , that they might be saved .
10 : 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God , but not according to knowledge .
10 : 3 For they being ignorant of God ' s righteousness , and going about to establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God .
( that is , to bring up Christ again from the dead .)
10 : 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him .
11 : 1 I say then , Hath God cast away his people ?
11 : 4 But what saith the answer of God unto him ?
I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal .
11 : 8 ( According as it is written , God hath given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear ;) unto this day .
11 : 15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
11 : 26 And so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written , There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob : 11 : 27 For this is my covenant unto them , when I shall take away their sins .
11 : 32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief , that he might have mercy upon all .
12 : 1 I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
Abhor that which is evil ; cleave to that which is good .
13 : 5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject , not only for wrath , but also for conscience sake .
13 : 8 Owe no man any thing , but to love one another : for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law .
He that eateth , eateth to the Lord , for he giveth God thanks ; and he that eateth not , to the Lord he eateth not , and giveth God thanks .
14 : 9 For to this end Christ both died , and rose , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
Destroy not him with thy meat , for whom Christ died .
14 : 16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of : 14 : 17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
15 : 1 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
15 : 30 Now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ ' s sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ; 15 : 31 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea ; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints ; 15 : 32 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed .
16 : 12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa , who labour in the Lord .
Salute the beloved Persis , which laboured much in the Lord .
16 : 16 Salute one another with an holy kiss .
was Paul crucified for you ?
1 : 17 For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect .
2 : 1 And I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
2 : 2 For I determined not to know any thing among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
2 : 6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought : 2 : 7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory : 2 : 8 Which none of the princes of this world knew : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
But we have the mind of Christ .
3 : 4 For while one saith , I am of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollos ; are ye not carnal ?
3 : 7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing , neither he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase .
3 : 11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
3 : 15 If any man ' s work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .
If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
3 : 20 And again , The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise , that they are vain .
For all things are your ' s ; 3 : 22 Whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are your ' s ; 3 : 23 And ye are Christ ' s ; and Christ is God ' s .
now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
4 : 8 Now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have reigned as kings without us : and I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
4 : 10 We are fools for Christ ' s sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
5 : 1 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles , that one should have his father ' s wife .
For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us : 5 : 8 Therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
6 : 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels ?
no , not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
6 : 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ?
7 : 1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me : It is good for a man not to touch a woman .
7 : 6 But I speak this by permission , and not of commandment .
7 : 17 But as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk .
7 : 19 Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
7 : 23 Ye are bought with a price ; be not ye the servants of men .
Art thou loosed from a wife ?
7 : 34 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin .
7 : 39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
8 : 1 Now as touching things offered unto idols , we know that we all have knowledge .
8 : 4 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is none other God but one .
8 : 8 But meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
9 : 2 If I be not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
9 : 6 Or I only and Barnabas , have not we power to forbear working ?
or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
9 : 11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ?
9 : 23 And this I do for the gospel ' s sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you .
10 : 19 What say I then ?
10 : 21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye cannot be partakers of the Lord ' s table , and of the table of devils .
10 : 22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ?
10 : 25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles , that eat , asking no question for conscience sake : 10 : 26 For the earth is the Lord ' s , and the fulness thereof .
10 : 32 Give none offence , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the church of God : 10 : 33 Even as I please all men in all things , not seeking mine own profit , but the profit of many , that they may be saved .
11 : 10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels .
11 : 16 But if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of God .
What shall I say to you ?
12 : 8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom ; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit ; 12 : 9 To another faith by the same Spirit ; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit ; 12 : 10 To another the working of miracles ; to another prophecy ; to another discerning of spirits ; to another divers kinds of tongues ; to another the interpretation of tongues : 12 : 11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit , dividing to every man severally as he will .
12 : 13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body , whether we be Jews or Gentiles , whether we be bond or free ; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit .
12 : 24 For our comely parts have no need : but God hath tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked .
12 : 28 And God hath set some in the church , first apostles , secondarily prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , diversities of tongues .
14 : 5 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
14 : 15 What is it then ?
14 : 24 But if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or one unlearned , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all : 14 : 25 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
14 : 29 Let the prophets speak two or three , and let the other judge .
14 : 33 For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all churches of the saints .
14 : 35 And if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
14 : 39 Wherefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak with tongues .
14 : 40 Let all things be done decently and in order .
15 : 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received , how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ; 15 : 4 And that he was buried , and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures : 15 : 5 And that he was seen of Cephas , then of the twelve : 15 : 6 After that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
15 : 9 For I am the least of the apostles , that am not meet to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
15 : 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
15 : 21 For since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
16 : 1 Now concerning the collection for the saints , as I have given order to the churches of Galatia , even so do ye .
16 : 12 As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
16 : 20 All the brethren greet you .
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
1 : 1 Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia : 1 : 2 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
1 : 5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be yea yea , and nay nay ?
2 : 8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him .
3 : 18 But we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the LORD .
4 : 7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
4 : 8 We are troubled on every side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ; 4 : 9 Persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast down , but not destroyed ; 4 : 10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body .
4 : 12 So then death worketh in us , but life in you .
4 : 15 For all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God .
5 : 14 For the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead : 5 : 15 And that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
5 : 20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by us : we pray you in Christ ' s stead , be ye reconciled to God .
6 : 2 ( For he saith , I have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation .)
6 : 3 Giving no offence in any thing , that the ministry be not blamed : 6 : 4 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God , in much patience , in afflictions , in necessities , in distresses , 6 : 5 In stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ; 6 : 6 By pureness , by knowledge , by longsuffering , by kindness , by the Holy Ghost , by love unfeigned , 6 : 7 By the word of truth , by the power of God , by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left , 6 : 8 By honour and dishonour , by evil report and good report : as deceivers , and yet true ; 6 : 9 As unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and , behold , we live ; as chastened , and not killed ; 6 : 10 As sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things .
6 : 13 Now for a recompence in the same , ( I speak as unto my children ,) be ye also enlarged .
7 : 6 Nevertheless God , that comforteth those that are cast down , comforted us by the coming of Titus ; 7 : 7 And not by his coming only , but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you , when he told us your earnest desire , your mourning , your fervent mind toward me ; so that I rejoiced the more .
7 : 8 For though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter .
7 : 15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you , whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
8 : 5 And this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and unto us by the will of God .
8 : 16 But thanks be to God , which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
10 : 12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
10 : 18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved , but whom the Lord commendeth .
11 : 8 I robbed other churches , taking wages of them , to do you service .
11 : 12 But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
11 : 15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
11 : 17 That which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold , ( I speak foolishly ,) I am bold also .
Are they Israelites ?
11 : 31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which is blessed for evermore , knoweth that I lie not .
I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
12 : 6 For though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
12 : 13 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ?
we speak before God in Christ : but we do all things , dearly beloved , for your edifying .
13 : 10 Therefore I write these things being absent , lest being present I should use sharpness , according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification , and not to destruction .
Be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
1 : 8 But though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
2 : 1 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , and took Titus with me also .
2 : 11 But when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
2 : 17 But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ?
2 : 19 For I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God .
3 : 1 O foolish Galatians , who hath bewitched you , that ye should not obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth , crucified among you ?
3 : 16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made .
God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
3 : 24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
4 : 3 Even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the elements of the world : 4 : 4 But when the fulness of the time was come , God sent forth his Son , made of a woman , made under the law , 4 : 5 To redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
4 : 10 Ye observe days , and months , and times , and years .
4 : 14 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not , nor rejected ; but received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
4 : 19 My little children , of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you , 4 : 20 I desire to be present with you now , and to change my voice ; for I stand in doubt of you .
4 : 21 Tell me , ye that desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
4 : 26 But Jerusalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
5 : 2 Behold , I Paul say unto you , that if ye be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
5 : 4 Christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
5 : 6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love .
5 : 11 And I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ?
5 : 12 I would they were even cut off which trouble you .
5 : 16 This I say then , Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh .
5 : 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith , 5 : 23 Meekness , temperance : against such there is no law .
5 : 25 If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
6 : 4 But let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
6 : 9 And let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
3 : 14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , 3 : 15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named , 3 : 16 That he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man ; 3 : 17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith ; that ye , being rooted and grounded in love , 3 : 18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height ; 3 : 19 And to know the love of Christ , which passeth knowledge , that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God .
4 : 4 There is one body , and one Spirit , even as ye are called in one hope of your calling ; 4 : 5 One Lord , one faith , one baptism , 4 : 6 One God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
4 : 9 ( Now that he ascended , what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?
5 : 12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret .
5 : 14 Wherefore he saith , Awake thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall give thee light .
5 : 33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
6 : 2 Honour thy father and mother ; which is the first commandment with promise ; 6 : 3 That it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth .
6 : 21 But that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things : 6 : 22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
1 : 19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ , 1 : 20 According to my earnest expectation and my hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life , or by death .
2 : 19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
2 : 27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
2 : 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation : 2 : 30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
3 : 4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh .
3 : 17 Brethren , be followers together of me , and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample .
3 : 18 ( For many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ : 3 : 19 Whose end is destruction , whose God is their belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things .)
3 : 20 For our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also we look for the Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ : 3 : 21 Who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
4 : 4 Rejoice in the Lord alway : and again I say , Rejoice .
4 : 5 Let your moderation be known unto all men .
4 : 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me .
4 : 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity .
4 : 19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus .
4 : 20 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever .
4 : 22 All the saints salute you , chiefly they that are of Caesar ' s household .
1 : 9 For this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ; 1 : 10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing , being fruitful in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ; 1 : 11 Strengthened with all might , according to his glorious power , unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness ; 1 : 12 Giving thanks unto the Father , which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light : 1 : 13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son : 1 : 14 In whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins : 1 : 15 Who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every creature : 1 : 16 For by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him : 1 : 17 And he is before all things , and by him all things consist .
1 : 21 And you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled 1 : 22 In the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight : 1 : 23 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled , and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel , which ye have heard , and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven ; whereof I Paul am made a minister ; 1 : 24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body ' s sake , which is the church : 1 : 25 Whereof I am made a minister , according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you , to fulfil the word of God ; 1 : 26 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations , but now is made manifest to his saints : 1 : 27 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles ; which is Christ in you , the hope of glory : 1 : 28 Whom we preach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom ; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus : 1 : 29 Whereunto I also labour , striving according to his working , which worketh in me mightily .
2 : 18 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind , 2 : 19 And not holding the Head , from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered , and knit together , increaseth with the increase of God .
3 : 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth ; fornication , uncleanness , inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness , which is idolatry : 3 : 6 For which things ' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience : 3 : 7 In the which ye also walked some time , when ye lived in them .
3 : 9 Lie not one to another , seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ; 3 : 10 And have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him : 3 : 11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free : but Christ is all , and in all .
3 : 14 And above all these things put on charity , which is the bond of perfectness .
3 : 20 Children , obey your parents in all things : for this is well pleasing unto the Lord .
They shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God , which have been a comfort unto me .
4 : 18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul .
1 : 9 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you , and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ; 1 : 10 And to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , which delivered us from the wrath to come .
2 : 19 For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ?
2 : 20 For ye are our glory and joy .
4 : 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first : 4 : 17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
5 : 11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together , and edify one another , even as also ye do .
5 : 22 Abstain from all appearance of evil .
5 : 24 Faithful is he that calleth you , who also will do it .
2 : 11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion , that they should believe a lie : 2 : 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
2 : 13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth : 2 : 14 Whereunto he called you by our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
2 : 16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , even our Father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace , 2 : 17 Comfort your hearts , and stablish you in every good word and work .
3 : 17 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so I write .
2 : 3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour ; 2 : 4 Who will have all men to be saved , and to come unto the knowledge of the truth .
2 : 14 And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression .
3 : 10 And let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
3 : 14 These things write I unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly : 3 : 15 But if I tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
4 : 14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
5 : 3 Honour widows that are widows indeed .
5 : 10 Well reported of for good works ; if she have brought up children , if she have lodged strangers , if she have washed the saints ' feet , if she have relieved the afflicted , if she have diligently followed every good work .
5 : 14 I will therefore that the younger women marry , bear children , guide the house , give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully .
And , The labourer is worthy of his reward .
5 : 19 Against an elder receive not an accusation , but before two or three witnesses .
5 : 22 Lay hands suddenly on no man , neither be partaker of other men ' s sins : keep thyself pure .
5 : 24 Some men ' s sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after .
5 : 25 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand ; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid .
6 : 1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
6 : 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain .
6 : 10 For the love of money is the root of all evil : which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
Amen .
The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy
2 : 4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier .
2 : 11 It is a faithful saying : For if we be dead with him , we shall also live with him : 2 : 12 If we suffer , we shall also reign with him : if we deny him , he also will deny us : 2 : 13 If we believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he cannot deny himself .
2 : 21 If a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified , and meet for the master ' s use , and prepared unto every good work .
3 : 14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of , knowing of whom thou hast learned them ; 3 : 15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .
4 : 12 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus .
4 : 13 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
4 : 14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : the Lord reward him according to his works : 4 : 15 Of whom be thou ware also ; for he hath greatly withstood our words .
4 : 16 At my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me : I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
4 : 19 Salute Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
4 : 20 Erastus abode at Corinth : but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick .
4 : 21 Do thy diligence to come before winter .
Grace be with you .
2 : 9 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things ; not answering again ; 2 : 10 Not purloining , but shewing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things .
3 : 1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers , to obey magistrates , to be ready to every good work , 3 : 2 To speak evil of no man , to be no brawlers , but gentle , shewing all meekness unto all men .
3 : 3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving divers lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another .
3 : 15 All that are with me salute thee .
Amen .
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon
1 : 7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love , because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee , brother .
1 : 8 Wherefore , though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient , 1 : 9 Yet for love ' s sake I rather beseech thee , being such an one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
1 : 17 If thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
1 : 20 Yea , brother , let me have joy of thee in the Lord : refresh my bowels in the Lord .
1 : 22 But withal prepare me also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .
1 : 1 God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets , 1 : 2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ; 1 : 3 Who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high : 1 : 4 Being made so much better than the angels , as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
1 : 7 And of the angels he saith , Who maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
2 : 7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; thou crownedst him with glory and honour , and didst set him over the works of thy hands : 2 : 8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet .
4 : 8 For if Jesus had given them rest , then would he not afterward have spoken of another day .
4 : 11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief .
7 : 4 Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils .
7 : 17 For he testifieth , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
7 : 19 For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God .
7 : 28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
8 : 6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
10 : 7 Then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me ,) to do thy will , O God .
10 : 11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins : 10 : 12 But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ; 10 : 13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool .
10 : 18 Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
10 : 19 Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus , 10 : 20 By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ; 10 : 21 And having an high priest over the house of God ; 10 : 22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
10 : 30 For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord .
10 : 38 Now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
11 : 5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
11 : 6 But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
11 : 8 By faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
11 : 9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise : 11 : 10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
11 : 11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised .
11 : 32 And what shall I more say ?
12 : 5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him : 12 : 6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth .
12 : 12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ; 12 : 13 And make straight paths for your feet , lest that which is lame be turned out of the way ; but let it rather be healed .
12 : 25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh .
13 : 7 Remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
13 : 12 Wherefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
1 : 2 My brethren , count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations ; 1 : 3 Knowing this , that the trying of your faith worketh patience .
1 : 8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways .
1 : 11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat , but it withereth the grass , and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth : so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways .
1 : 12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
2 : 5 Hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
2 : 14 What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and have not works ?
2 : 15 If a brother or sister be naked , and destitute of daily food , 2 : 16 And one of you say unto them , Depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
2 : 25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
3 : 3 Behold , we put bits in the horses ' mouths , that they may obey us ; and we turn about their whole body .
3 : 5 Even so the tongue is a little member , and boasteth great things .
3 : 10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing .
3 : 12 Can the fig tree , my brethren , bear olive berries ?
3 : 16 For where envying and strife is , there is confusion and every evil work .
4 : 9 Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
5 : 9 Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned : behold , the judge standeth before the door .
5 : 14 Is any sick among you ?
1 : 12 Unto whom it was revealed , that not unto themselves , but unto us they did minister the things , which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven ; which things the angels desire to look into .
1 : 17 And if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man ' s work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear : 1 : 18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things , as silver and gold , from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers ; 1 : 19 But with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot : 1 : 20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you , 1 : 21 Who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
2 : 6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture , Behold , I lay in Sion a chief corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded .
2 : 11 Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ; 2 : 12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
2 : 13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord ' s sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ; 2 : 14 Or unto governors , as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers , and for the praise of them that do well .
but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
2 : 21 For even hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps : 2 : 22 Who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth : 2 : 23 Who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously : 2 : 24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
3 : 1 Likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ; 3 : 2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear .
3 : 3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparel ; 3 : 4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
3 : 8 Finally , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one of another , love as brethren , be pitiful , be courteous : 3 : 9 Not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing : but contrariwise blessing ; knowing that ye are thereunto called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
4 : 6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
4 : 9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging .
4 : 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men ' s matters .
Amen .
5 : 12 By Silvanus , a faithful brother unto you , as I suppose , I have written briefly , exhorting , and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand .
1 : 5 And beside this , giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue knowledge ; 1 : 6 And to knowledge temperance ; and to temperance patience ; and to patience godliness ; 1 : 7 And to godliness brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness charity .
1 : 12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
2 : 4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ; 2 : 5 And spared not the old world , but saved Noah the eighth person , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly ; 2 : 6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ; 2 : 7 And delivered just Lot , vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked : 2 : 8 ( For that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds ;) 2 : 9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations , and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished : 2 : 10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government .
2 : 20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
3 : 9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us - ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
3 : 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
2 : 3 And hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
2 : 5 But whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
2 : 7 Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning .
The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
2 : 17 And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
2 : 26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
3 : 5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
3 : 9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he cannot sin , because he is born of God .
3 : 13 Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
3 : 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
3 : 20 For if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
3 : 22 And whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
4 : 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God dwelleth in him , and he in God .
5 : 3 For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
5 : 7 For there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
5 : 16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death .
5 : 18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
5 : 20 And we know that the Son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ .
1 : 8 Look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
1 : 13 The children of thy elect sister greet thee .
The Third Epistle General of John
1 : 11 Beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good .
He that doeth good is of God : but he that doeth evil hath not seen God .
1 : 12 Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
Our friends salute thee .
Greet the friends by name .
1 : 1 Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called : 1 : 2 Mercy unto you , and peace , and love , be multiplied .
1 : 11 Woe unto them !
Amen .
1 : 3 Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
Unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood , 1 : 6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever .
2 : 1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write ; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand , who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks ; 2 : 2 I know thy works , and thy labour , and thy patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars : 2 : 3 And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name ' s sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
2 : 17 He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna , and will give him a white stone , and in the stone a new name written , which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it .
2 : 24 But unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
3 : 3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent .
3 : 16 So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
5 : 9 And they sung a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred , and tongue , and people , and nation ; 5 : 10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests : and we shall reign on the earth .
6 : 9 And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held : 6 : 10 And they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
7 : 5 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand .
7 : 16 They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
8 : 8 And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ; 8 : 9 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
8 : 10 And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ; 8 : 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
9 : 4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
9 : 7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
10 : 9 And I went unto the angel , and said unto him , Give me the little book .
And he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
11 : 3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
11 : 5 And if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
11 : 11 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
12 : 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
13 : 1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
13 : 4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast : and they worshipped the beast , saying , Who is like unto the beast ?
13 : 6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his tabernacle , and them that dwell in heaven .
Here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
13 : 11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb , and he spake as a dragon .
13 : 18 Here is wisdom .
14 : 1 And I looked , and , lo , a Lamb stood on the mount Sion , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his Father ' s name written in their foreheads .
These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth .
14 : 12 Here is the patience of the saints : here are they that keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
14 : 18 And another angel came out from the altar , which had power over fire ; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle , saying , Thrust in thy sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe .
14 : 19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
for thou only art holy : for all nations shall come and worship before thee ; for thy judgments are made manifest .
15 : 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
16 : 17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , It is done .
16 : 19 And the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
17 : 7 And the angel said unto me , Wherefore didst thou marvel ?
17 : 9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom .
17 : 13 These have one mind , and shall give their power and strength unto the beast .
18 : 9 And the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her , shall bewail her , and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning , 18 : 10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment , saying , Alas , alas that great city Babylon , that mighty city !
18 : 14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
18 : 20 Rejoice over her , thou heaven , and ye holy apostles and prophets ; for God hath avenged you on her .
18 : 21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
19 : 5 And a voice came out of the throne , saying , Praise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
19 : 6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth .
19 : 11 And I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
This is the second death .
21 : 2 And I John saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down from God out of heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
21 : 3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying , Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and God himself shall be with them , and be their God .
21 : 5 And he that sat upon the throne said , Behold , I make all things new .
21 : 6 And he said unto me , It is done .
21 : 21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls : every several gate was of one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
21 : 23 And the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it , and the Lamb is the light thereof .
22 : 5 And there shall be no night there ; and they need no candle , neither light of the sun ; for the Lord God giveth them light : and they shall reign for ever and ever .
22 : 11 He that is unjust , let him be unjust still : and he which is filthy , let him be filthy still : and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still : and he that is holy , let him be holy still .
22 : 13 I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , the first and the last .
22 : 15 For without are dogs , and sorcerers , and whoremongers , and murderers , and idolaters , and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie .
I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .
Amen .

Till the little ones , weary , No more can be merry : The sun does descend , And our sports have an end .
Round the laps of their mothers Many sisters and brothers , Like birds in their nest , Are ready for rest , And sport no more seen On the darkening green .
Little Lamb , God bless thee !
My mother taught me underneath a tree , And , sitting down before the heat of day , She took me on her lap and kissed me , And , pointed to the east , began to say :
Under leaves so green A happy blossom Sees you , swift as arrow , Seek your cradle narrow , Near my bosom .
When my mother died I was very young , And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry " Weep !
weep !
" Father , father , where are you going ?
The night was dark , no father was there , The child was wet with dew ; The mire was deep , and the child did weep , And away the vapour flew .
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams By happy , silent , moony beams !
Thou His image ever see , Heavenly face that smiles on thee !
For Mercy , Pity , Peace , and Love , Is God our Father dear ; And Mercy , Pity , Peace , and Love , Is man , his child and care .
Oh what a multitude they seemed , these flowers of London town !
They look in every thoughtless nest Where birds are covered warm ; They visit caves of every beast , To keep them all from harm : If they see any weeping That should have been sleeping , They pour sleep on their head , And sit down by their bed .
And there the lion ' s ruddy eyes Shall flow with tears of gold : And pitying the tender cries , And walking round the fold : Saying : " Wrath by His meekness , And , by His health , sickness , Are driven away From our immortal day .
NURSE ' S SONG
The little ones leaped , and shouted , and laughed , And all the hills echoed .
never can it be !
Never , never can it be !
Never , never can it be !
SONGS OF EXPERIENCE
EARTH ' S ANSWER
" Prisoned on watery shore , Starry jealousy does keep my den Cold and hoar ; Weeping o ' re , I hear the father of the ancient men .
Can delight , Chained in night , The virgins of youth and morning bear ?
Shall arise , and seek for her Maker meek ; And the desert wild Become a garden mild .
In the southern clime , Where the summer ' s prime Never fades away , Lovely Lyca lay .
" Sweet sleep , come to me Underneath this tree ; Do father , mother , weep ?
The kingly lion stood , And the virgin viewed : Then he gambolled round O ' er the hallowed ground .
Turning back was vain : Soon his heavy mane Bore them to the ground , Then he stalked around ,
They look upon his eyes , Filled with deep surprise ; And wondering behold A spirit armed in gold .
Then they followed Where the vision led , And saw their sleeping child Among tigers wild .
" Because I was happy upon the heath , And smiled among the winter ' s snow , They clothed me in the clothes of death , And taught me to sing the notes of woe .
" And because I am happy and dance and sing , They think they have done me no injury , And are gone to praise God and his priest and king , Who make up a heaven of our misery ."
When voices of children are heard on the green , And whisperings are in the dale , The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind , My face turns green and pale .
Then come home , my children , the sun is gone down , And the dews of night arise ; Your spring and your day are wasted in play , And your winter and night in disguise .
Am not I A fly like thee ?
Or art not thou A man like me ?
I dreamt a dream !
What the hammer ?
what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp ?
Did he who made the lamb make thee ?
Tiger , tiger , burning bright In the forests of the night , What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry ?
THE LITTLE VAGABOND
Dear mother , dear mother , the Church is cold ; But the Alehouse is healthy , and pleasant , and warm .
Besides , I can tell where I am used well ; The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell .
said he : " One who sets reason up for judge Of our most holy mystery ."
And burned him in a holy place Where many had been burned before ; The weeping parents wept in vain .
Tired with kisses sweet , They agree to meet When the silent sleep Waves o ' er heaven ' s deep , And the weary tired wanderers weep .
TO TERZAH
Or Love in a golden bowl ?
The Author & Printer Willm .
Thy wine doth purify the golden honey ; thy perfume .
The Cloud then shewd his golden head & his bright form emerg ' d .
And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more .
Nothing remains ; O maid I tell thee , when I pass away .
It is to tenfold life , to love , to peace , and raptures holy : Unseen descending , weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers : And court the fair eyed dew , to take me to her shining tent The weeping virgin , trembling kneels before the risen sun .
Dost thou O little cloud ?
Then if thou art the food of worms , O virgin of the skies , How great thy use , how great thy blessing , every thing that lives .
image of weakness .
O beauty of the vales of Har , we live not for ourselves , Thou seest me the meanest thing , and so I am indeed : My bosom of itself is cold , and of itself is dark ,
The daughter of beauty wip ' d her pitying tears with her white veil , And said , Alas !
Or an Eye of gifts & graces showring fruits & coined gold !
Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling & affright Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy ?

THE LITTLE YELLOW TULIP
" It ' s the Rain , and I want to come in ," said a soft , sad , little voice .
" No , you can ' t come in ," the little Tulip said .
By and by she heard another little _tap , tap , tap_ on the window - pane .
" Who is there ?"
she said .
The same soft little voice answered , " It ' s the Rain , and I want to come in !"
" N -- no ," said the little Tulip , " you can ' t come in ."
" It ' s the Sunshine ," said the cheery little voice , " and I want to come in , I want to come in !"
" _Who is there ? _ " she said .
Then they said ,--
So she poked her head through ; and she was in the midst of a beautiful garden .
A very little boy made this story up " out of his head ," and told it to his papa .
Once upon a time there was a little boy , and he wanted to be a cock - a - doo - dle - doo .
And he wanted to fly up into the sky .
" Not I ," said the Goose .
" I will , then ," said the little Red Hen , and she took the wheat to the mill .
Cluck !
They hadn ' t any little girls or any little boys , at all .
When the little old woman had rolled him out , and dressed him up , and pinched his gingerbread shoes into shape , she put him in a pan ; then she put the pan in the oven and shut the door ; and she thought , " Now I shall have a little boy of my own ."
" You can ' t catch me , I ' m the Gingerbread Man !"
And , as the cow chased him , he looked over his shoulder and cried ,--
" Run !
as fast as you can !
" A little old man ,
" And I can run away from you , I can !"
" A little old man ,
But the little Gingerbread Boy shouted across to him , " You can ' t catch me !"
" I have run away from a little old woman ,
" A little old man ,
Just then , the little Gingerbread Boy came to a river .
When he was a little way from the bank he turned his head , and said , " You are too heavy on my tail , little Gingerbread Boy , I fear I shall let you get wet ; jump on my back ."
And he pounced on them , killed them , and gobbled them up .
nonsense , mother !"
" Now , mother , don ' t you fret ," said the little father Jackal ; " you do just as I tell you , and it will be all right ."
When he saw them coming he stood up , and roared in a terrible voice ,--
" Indeed , Father Lion ," he said , " we meant to come before ; we knew we ought to come before ; and we wanted to come before ; but every time we started to come , a dreadful great lion came out of the woods and roared at us , and frightened us so that we ran away ."
" Take me to this Lion ," he said ; " I ' ll eat him up and then I ' ll eat you up ."
" He lives down there , Father Lion !"
The Lion above shook his mane again and growled again , and made a terrible face .
But the lion in the water made just as terrible a one , back .
He leaped down into the well after the other lion .
And when he was drowned , the little Jackals took hold of hands and danced round the well , and sang ,--
Ao !"
" Really ," he said , " you do not live well at all ; you should see how I live !
I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day .
There , on the lowest shelf , behind some stone jars , stood a big paper bag of brown sugar .
He was just thinking how lucky the City Mouse was , when suddenly the door opened with a bang , and in came the cook to get some flour .
It smelt so good that it went to the little Country Mouse ' s head .
LITTLE JACK ROLLAROUND
Once upon a time there was a wee little boy who slept in a tiny trundle - bed near his mother ' s great bed .
His mother pushed him about in her sleep , until her slumber became too sound ; then she stopped .
So the good Moon made a light and went along with him , and the little trundle - bed boat went sailing down the streets into the main street of the village .
High up on the church steeple , the Weather - vane answered , " It is no time for people to be in the streets ; decent folk are in their beds ."
" Then I ' ll go to the woods , so that the animals may see me ," said Little Jack .
" I will go with you ; make a path !"
I am coming !"
" Do not treat the little Stars so ," said the good Moon .
But Jack Rollaround only behaved the worse : " Get out of the way , old Moon !"
he cried , and steered for the light .
This was what they were saying :--
Little Brother Rabbit sniggered to himself .
My cow is stuck in the mud , a quarter of a mile from here .
" Never fear ," said the Elephant , " I could pull twenty cows ."
" I am sure you could ," said the Rabbit , politely , " only be sure to begin gently , and pull harder and harder till you get her ."
" This is a remarkably heavy cow ," said the Elephant ; " but I ' ll fetch her !"
The reason was , of course , that the Elephant had something solid to brace against , and , beside , as fast as he pulled the rope in a little , he took a turn with it round his trunk !
The Elephant was jerked off his feet , and came slipping and sliding to the beach , and into the surf .
spouted the Whale .
" I ' ll teach you to play cow !"
So that broke up the bargain between them .
She was much pleased with their looks as they came from the shell .
It was just half a chicken .
said the little Half - Chick .
said the little Half - Chick .
And he went laughing off , hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick .
" Ho !
the idea !"
" The very thing for the King ' s dinner !"
And she seized the little Half - Chick by his one wing and threw him into a kettle of water on the fire .
Stay down , don ' t come so high !"
But the Fire said , " Little Half - Chick , little Half - Chick , when I was in trouble you would not help me ," and burned hotter than ever .
He cannot hoppity - kick any more , but he turns slowly round when the wind blows , and keeps his head toward it , to hear what it says .
Wee folk , good folk , Trooping all together ; Green jacket , red cap , And white owl ' s feather !
Once upon a time , there was a little brown Field Mouse ; and one day he was out in the fields to see what he could find .
Little Mr Field Mouse ran to the root and poked his nose under after the acorn , and there he saw a small round hole in the ground .
The Field Mouse hurried as fast as he could down the last stairs , and pushed through just as the door was closing .
It shut behind him , and he was in a little room .
Finally , he climbed up on a chair and opened a wee , wee door in the chimney - piece ,-- and there it was !
He took it quickly in his forepaws , and then he took it in his mouth , and then he ran away .
An old Fox , crafty and sly , had a den in the rocks , on a hill near her house .
" I ' m glad I ' m safely in ," she said .
" Can ' t I , though !"
said the Fox .
she cut a little hole in the bag ; then she poked her head out and saw where she was , and as soon as they came to a good spot she cut the hole bigger and jumped out herself .
There was a great big stone lying there , and the little Red Hen picked it up and put it in the bag as quick as a wink .
" When I open the bag you hold the cover off the kettle and I ' ll shake the bag so that the Hen will fall in , and then you pop the cover on , before she can jump out ."
And they were scalded to death .
And so away he wint Wid the bag upon his back , An ' up the hill and through the woods Saftly he made his track .
says Fox , " we ' ll see ; I ' ll bring yees down from that ."
It melted , and melted , and as it melted it ran down Epaminondas ' forehead ; then it ran over his face , and in his ears , and down his neck .
His Mammy looked at him , and then she said ,--
" Epaminondas , you ain ' t got the sense you was born with !
" All right , Mammy ," said Epaminondas .
So Epaminondas tied a string around the end of the loaf and took hold of the end of the string and came along home , like this .
" Bread !!!"
Now I ain ' t gwine tell you any more ways to bring truck home .
But I ' ll just tell you one thing , Epaminondas !
You see these here six mince pies I done make ?
But when they got there the boy laughed at them for their pains ; there was no wolf there .
" There is a wolf in the flock !
They sent a messenger to Jove and begged him to send a king to rule over them .
Jove saw how stupid they were , and sent a king who could not harm them : he tossed a big log into the middle of the pond .
At the splash the Frogs were terribly frightened , and dived into their holes to hide from King Log .
And as soon as they found he really could not hurt them they began to despise him ; and finally they sent another messenger to Jove to ask for a new king .
Jove sent an eel .
As it grew hotter and hotter , the man unfastened his cloak ; then he threw it back ; at last he took it off !
The little Jackal was very fond of shell - fish .
what shall I do ?"
ho !
The old Alligator lashed with his tail and snapped with his jaws , but it was too late ; the little Jackal was out of reach .
" When I don ' t see any little crabs on the land I generally see them sticking out of the water , and then I put my paw in and catch them .
Kind Mr Alligator !
And he ran away like the wind .
Still , he did not mean to take any chances .
I ' ll investigate a bit ."
The old Alligator , underneath his fig pile , thought ,--
Presently , as he came along , he saw that the ground was all raked up as if something very heavy had been dragged over it .
" What ' s this ?
What ' s this ?"
the little Jackal said .
" I think I ' ll investigate a little !"
So he stood quite still and began to talk to himself ( you remember , it was a little way he had ), but loudly .
" How strange that my little House doesn ' t speak to me !
The old Alligator thought to himself that he must certainly pretend to be the little House , or the little Jackal would never come in .
When the little Jackal heard that , he was frightened enough , for once .
" It ' s the old Alligator ," he said , " and if I don ' t make an end of him this time he will certainly make an end of me .
" Oh , Mother , dear Mother ," they said , " you must move us away to - night !
The next night the little Larks were quite trembling with fear ; the moment their mother got home they cried out , " Mother , you must surely move us to - night !
And then he called his son and told him to ask all the uncles and cousins to come to - morrow and cut the corn .
" Don ' t worry ," said the mother Lark ; " the uncles and cousins have plenty of reaping to do for themselves ; we ' ll not move yet ."
And then he called his son and said , ' Go out to - night and hire reapers , and to - morrow we will begin to cut .'"
Once there were four little girls who lived in a big , bare house , in the country .
They were very poor , but they had the happiest times you ever heard of , because they were very rich in everything except money .
When it came to the place in the story where the giant tried to follow Jack , the little girl cut down the beanstalk , and down came the giant tumbling from the loft .
The giant was made out of pillows , with a great , fierce head of paper , and funny clothes .
She sewed for people , and when she was a little older she taught some little girls their lessons , and then she wrote stories for the papers .
And , children , the little book made Louisa famous .
PICCOLA
' Tis seldom Fortune such favour grants As fell to this little maid of France .
Now such a story who ever heard ?
A sparrow , that in at the window flew , Had crept into Piccola ' s tiny shoe !
In the far - off land of France , they say , Still do they live to this very day .
When I was a very little girl some one , probably my mother , read to me Hans Christian Andersen ' s story of the Little Fir Tree .
The Little Fir Tree was very unhappy because he was not big like the others .
But they always said ,--
But he always said ,--
" Oh , no ; you are too little , you are too little !"
The Little Fir Tree , close down in the cover of the others , would call up ,--
But the snow always said ,--
how the Little Fir Tree pricked up his needles !
But when they came to the town he was taken out and set upright in a tub and placed on the edge of a path in a row of other fir trees , all small , but none so little as he .
Then some pretty ladies , with white caps on their heads and white aprons over their blue dresses , came bringing little parcels .
The Little Fir Tree could not breathe , for joy and wonder .
Why was this glory for him ?
After a time every one went away and left him .
Oh , isn ' t it lovely !"
And then , at last , the Little Fir Tree knew what he was ; he was a Christmas tree !
And for love of this friend , the king of Egypt had let numbers of the Israelites settle in his land .
They thought the old men would die and the young men be so ill and weary that they could not bring up families , and so the race would dwindle away .
Then he did the most wicked thing of all .
He ordered his soldiers to kill every boy baby that should be born in an Israelitish family ; he did not care about the girls , because they could not grow up to fight .
But he was a boy !
How could she save him from death ?
But at the end of that time , she saw that it would not be possible to keep him safe any longer .
First , she took a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it all over with pitch , so that it was water - tight , and then she laid the baby in it ; then she carried it to the edge of the river and laid it in the flags by the river ' s brink .
Then she kissed her little son and left him there .
And can you think how happy the baby ' s mother was ?
For now the baby would be known only as the princess ' s adopted child , and would be safe .
Then he was brought and given to the king ' s daughter , and he became her son .
But the strangest part of the whole story is , that when Moses grew to be a man he became so strong and wise that it was he who at last saved his people from the king and rescued them from the Egyptians .
THE TEN FAIRIES
or " How shall I do that ?"
Elsa ' s husband had a hard time of it ; he had only poor food to eat , and it was not ready at the right time , and the house looked all in a muddle .
Little Elsa cried bitterly when he was gone , for she did not want to make her husband unhappy and cross , and she wanted the house to look nice .
" Oh , dear ," she sobbed , " I wish I could do things right !
And as he named the fingers , one after another , the tiny fairies bowed their tiny heads ; there was a fairy for every name .
" Hop !
hide yourselves away !"
The tiny fairies who were hidden away there were not used to remaining still , and they were getting restless .
Elsa ' s husband grew so proud of her that he went about saying to everybody , " My grandmother was a fine housekeeper , and my mother was a fine housekeeper , but neither of them could hold a candle to my wife .
He worked as hard as he could , and still he could not earn enough to keep himself and his wife .
At last there came a day when he had nothing left but one piece of leather , big enough to make one pair of shoes .
But the first customer who came was so pleased with the beautiful shoes that he bought them , and paid so much that the shoemaker was able to buy leather enough for two pairs .
Once more he cut out the shoes and left them on the bench .
I forgot your children , and trod on them ."
" Yes , your Majesty ," said the Mouse - deer , " but I did not mean to ."
said the king .
" Why ?"
" Why did you wear your coat of mail ?"
said the king .
It is as long as it can be , And yet she doesn ' t care .
So then she winds it , shiny brown , Around her head into a crown , Just like the day before .
THE BRAHMIN , THE TIGER , AND THE JACKAL
I am so thirsty , and there is no water here ."
The moment he was out he sprang on the Brahmin , and was about to eat him up .
( A banyan tree is a kind of fruit tree .)
" Brother Bullock , oh , Brother Bullock , does it seem to you a fair thing that this Tiger should eat me up , after I have just freed him from a cage ?"
" When I was young and strong my master used me hard , and I served him well .
Now that I am old and weak and cannot work , he leaves me without food or water , to die by the wayside .
Men are a thankless lot .
Men are a cruel breed .
" I lie here in the mud all day , as harmless as a pigeon ; I hunt no man , yet every time a man sees me , he throws stones at me , and pokes me with sharp sticks , and jeers at me .
Let the Tiger eat the Brahmin !"
Finally , the Tiger walked on with him .
" Oh , Brother Jackal , dear Brother Jackal ," said the Brahmin , " give us your opinion !
said the little Jackal .
" Cage ?"
said the little Jackal , vacantly .
" You see ----"
So the Brahmin , the Tiger , and the little Jackal walked back together to the spot where the cage was .
" Oh , I beg your pardon , Father Tiger ," said the little Jackal , " I really am _so_ stupid ; I cannot _quite_ understand what happened .
And he shut and bolted the door !
Well , Brother Brahmin , now that it is locked , I should advise you to let it stay locked !
Then he made a very low bow to the Brahmin .
He went to his friend the Camel , and said ,--
" Indeed I will ," said the Camel , who was very fond of sugar - cane .
" It is on the other side of the river ," said the little Jackal ; " but we can manage it nicely , if you will take me on your back and swim over ."
So they came down , with sticks and stones .
They ran at him and beat him , and stoned him , and drove him away half dead .
" Oh , I don ' t know _why_ " said the little Jackal ,--" I always sing after dinner !"
" Ah , very well , let us go home now ."
" I have the strangest feeling ," said the Camel ,--" I feel as if I must roll over ."
It was a valley of brown , bare , desert soil , in a climate where almost no rain falls ; but the snow on the mountain - tops sent down little streams of pure water , the winds were gentle , and lying like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hills was a marvellous lake of salt water ,-- an inland sea .
They were hopping from the barren places into the young , green crops , and as they settled down they ate the tiny shoots and leaves to the ground .
And at last the people fell on their knees and wept and cried in despair , for they saw starvation and death in the fields .
" What does it mean ?"
" The gulls are eating what the crickets have left !
they will strip root and branch !"
The Chamberlain asked the maid to take him to the Nightingale ' s home , and many of the lords and ladies followed after .
A little farther on they heard some bullfrogs , in a swamp .
" Surely that is the Nightingale ," said the courtiers ; " it really sounds like church - bells !"
At last they came to the wood where the Nightingale was .
" Dear , dear ," said the courtiers , " that is very pleasant ; does that little grey bird really make all that noise ?
The little Nightingale said she could sing better in her own greenwood , but she was so sweet and kind that she came with them .
They asked the little Nightingale to sing , over and over again , and when they had listened enough the Emperor said that she should be made " Singer in Chief to the Court ."
It was not so very much fun to go out that way !
And when the courtiers met each other in the halls , one would say " Night ," and the other would say " ingale ," and that was supposed to be conversation .
At last , one day , there came a little package to the Emperor , on the outside of which was written , " The Nightingale ."
They made it sing that same tune thirty - three times , and still they had not had enough .
The people in the court liked her even better than the old Nightingale , because they could all whistle her tunes ,-- which you can ' t do with real nightingales .
The poor Emperor lay , quite cold and pale , in his great big bed , with velvet curtains and tall candlesticks all about .
He opened his eyes , and there was Death , sitting on his heart .
Some were very , very ugly , and some were sweet and lovely ; they were all the things the Emperor had done in his life , good and bad .
When Death was gone , the Emperor said to the little Nightingale , " Oh , dear little Nightingale , you have saved me from Death !
MARGERY ' S GARDEN
" Oh !
" Something for you , Margery ," said her mother , with the look she had when something nice was happening .
" You know , dear , the ground has to be made ready first ; it takes a little time ,-- it may be several days before you can plant ."
But this was what had happened .
She could see that it took real skill and strength to keep the line even , and to avoid the stones .
Sometimes the plough struck a hidden stone , and then the man was jerked almost off his feet .
said Margery .
After the ploughing and harrowing , the man drove off , and Margery ' s father said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late afternoons , when he came home from business ; they could not afford too much help , he said , and he had learned to take care of a garden when he was a boy .
So Margery watched .
It was pretty to watch ; it made Margery think of a photograph her teacher had , a photograph of a famous picture called " The Sower ."
You stand beside the little trench and walk backward , and as you walk you hoe the loose earth back over the seeds ; the same earth that was hoed up you pull back again .
Margery and her mother had taken so much pains in thinking out the arrangement of the flowers , that perhaps you will like to hear just how they designed that garden .
Between the flowers and the middle path went the seeds for that wonderful salad garden ; all the things Mrs Brown had named to Margery were there .
Mother and father and Margery were late to supper that evening .
I have a garden !"
was Margery ' s last thought as she went off to dreamland .
The little leaves , no bigger than half your little - finger nail , grew in twos ,-- two on each tiny stem ; they were almost round .
In irregular patches on the row , hints of green were coming .
" Do you suppose we can have planted _all_ radishes ?"
Her little face was so anxious that he thought something unpleasant had happened .
" Papa ," said Margery , " the little leaves all look exactly alike !
" Many of the dicotyledonous plants look alike at the beginning ," he said , with a little drawl on the big word .
" What ' s ' dicotyledonous '?"
said Margery , carefully .
That evening Margery was waiting eagerly for him .
As soon as the real leaves come out and begin to draw food from the air , these little substitutes wither up and fall off .
These two lie folded up in the little seed from the beginning , and are full of plant food .
said Margery .
" I think that is interesting ," said Margery .
Margery ' s father took her in his arms .
After many years of this pleasant living , the pond became very low , in a dry season ; and finally it dried up .
They went to the Tortoise to bid her good - bye .
" Take me with you ; I must die if I am left here ."
The Tortoise forgot everything except that she wanted to say , " Hush , you foolish people !"
One day , this proud king was sitting in his place at church , at vesper service ; his courtiers were about him , in their bright garments , and he himself was dressed in his royal robes .
" I am the king !"
The courtiers started from their seats , and drew their swords .
At the end of three years , the Pope called the Emperor of Allemaine and the King of Sicily , his brothers , to a great meeting in his city of Rome .
And again Robert was pushed back among the serving - men .
And when Easter Day came , never had there been so lovely , so holy a day : in the great churches , filled with flowers , and sweet with incense , the kneeling people listened to the choirs singing , and it was like the voices of angels ; their prayers were more earnest than ever before , their praise more glad ; there was something heavenly in Rome .
Robert of Sicily went to the services with the rest , and sat in the humblest place with the servants .
At last , he sent them all away , saying he wanted to be alone ; but he commanded the jester to stay .
And when they were alone together the king looked into Robert ' s eyes , as he had done before , and said , softly , " Who art thou ?"
Robert of Sicily bowed his head .
He did such fine work that the Elector , Prince Johann Wilhelm , ordered a portrait statue of himself , on horseback , to be done in bronze .
The artist was overjoyed at the commission , and worked early and late at the statue .
At last the work was done , and the artist had the great statue set up in the public square of Duesseldorf , ready for the opening view .
The artist listened , quietly .
" The rear right foot is as it should be , now ," said a third , " and it adds so much to the beauty of the whole !"
The fourth said that he considered the tail greatly improved .
" I am glad they are pleased ," he said , " but the fact is , I have changed nothing !"
I can give him good advice , reprove him when he does wrong , and punish him if he will not punish himself ; I can and will be his best friend , but I cannot make him good unless he wills it ."
I have brought you a gift ; it is not wonderful to look at , but it has a wonderful power for your welfare ; wear it , and let it help you ."
Now , after a while , he began to find out that this was not true , and it made him angry .
said the prince , crossly .
But the little dog was so used to being petted that he only jumped up on his master , and tried to kiss his hand .
Whenever he was crossed , or could not have his own way instantly , he flew into a passion .
To his great astonishment , she refused .
" Am I not pleasing to you ?"
" You are very handsome , very charming , prince ," said Zelia ; " but you are not like the good king , your father ; I fear you would make me very miserable if I were your queen ."
Prince Cherry went at once to Zelia ' s dungeon , prepared to do this cruel thing .
" I know his heart ," said Suliman , " it is not all bad ; it is tainted , but not corrupt ; perhaps he will repent and come back to us a good king ."
" Good enough !
But in order to keep the little dog from growing , the queen ordered that he should be fed very little , and that was pretty hard for the poor prince .
Oh , how he wished he were the monster once more , so that he could kill the men and rescue her !
But suddenly he thought , " I was as bad as these men ; I myself put Zelia in prison , and would have treated her worse still , if I had not been prevented ."
And instantly Prince Cherry was transformed into a little white dove .
" Ah , Zelia , see what you have done !"
" Zelia has broken your spell ," she said to the prince , " as I meant she should , when you were worthy of her love ."
But he knew that his three sons despised the farm work , and were eager to make wealth fast , through adventure .
But no pot of gold was to be found .
The woman is not at all pretty : she wears thick , common shoes , a plain dress , with a little shawl , and a sun - bonnet ; she is stout and short , and her face is a square - chinned Irish face ; but her eyes look at you like your mother ' s .
When Margaret was a tiny baby , her father and mother died , and she was adopted by two young people as poor and as kind as her own parents .
Pretty soon she had worked so hard that she had some money saved from her wages .
With this , she bought two cows and a little delivery cart .
Then she carried her milk to her customers in the little cart every morning ; and as she went , she begged the pieces of food left over from the hotels and rich houses , and brought it back in the cart to the hungry children in the asylum .
Margaret was so careful and so good at business that , in spite of her giving , she bought more cows and earned more money .
After a time , Margaret had a chance to get a bakery , and then she became a bread - woman instead of a milk - woman .
She carried the bread just as she had carried the milk , in her cart .
She used to sit at the open door of her office , in a calico gown and a little shawl , and give a good word to everybody , rich or poor .
It is said that there were two quite different kinds of people in Ireland : one set of people with long dark hair and dark eyes , called Fomorians -- they carried long slender spears made of golden bronze when they fought -- and another race of people who were golden - haired and blue - eyed , and who carried short , blunt , heavy spears of dull metal .
And the Dagda took his harp and swept his hand across the strings in three great , solemn chords .
Again the Dagda touched the strings , and this time the magic Music of Mirth leaped from the harp .
When they were all deep in slumber , the Dagda took his magic harp , and he and his golden - haired warriors stole softly away , and came in safety to their own homes again .
He had not gone far when he met a white horse , and he saluted him .
" God save you ," said the tailor .
The trouble was , that three giants lived in the wood near the court , and every night they came out of the wood and threw down all that was built by day .
" Would you make me a hole ," said the old white garraun , " where I could go in to hide whenever the people come to fetch me to the mill or the kiln , so that they won ' t see me ; for they tire me out doing work for them ?"
" God save you ," said the fox .
said the fox .
said the fox .
" The rest of the foxes are always beating me , and they will not allow me to eat anything with them ."
He took his axe and his saw , and he made a thing like a crate , and he told the fox to get into it so that he could see whether it would fit him .
When the fox was satisfied at last that he had a nice place of it within , he asked the tailor to let him out , and the tailor answered that he would not .
said the lion .
When the great stone was raised up , the tailor put some sort of contrivance under it , that he might be able to throw it down as soon as the giants came near to it .
The tailor went out then , and he got a sheepskin , which he sewed up until he made a bag of it , and he slipped it down under his coat .
The giant drank another gallon then , and the tailor let another gallon down into the skin , but the giant thought he was drinking it .
They released the old white garraun then , and the old white garraun , the fox , the lion , and the army of Dublin pursued the tailor and his wife , and it was not long before they came up with them .
When the tailor saw them coming , he got out of the coach with his wife , and he sat down on the ground .
" No !"
Now about this time were found in Denmark two great millstones , so large that no one had the strength to turn them .
But no one guessed that these were really Giant - Maidens who bore a grudge against all of the race of Odin .
The greedy man could not bear to see even an instant ' s pause , and he came out of the shadow , and bade them , with harsh words , go on grinding , and cease not except for so long as the cuckoo was silent , or while he himself sang a song .
" No longer will Frode sit on his throne , and rule over rings of red gold and mighty millstones .
red warriors come forth -- and revenge , and bloodshed , and ruin ."
One lovely summer morning , just as the sun rose , two travellers started on a journey .
The lazy man sat down in the grass with a discontented sigh .
But the industrious man ran after the lovely lady and caught the hem of her floating robe in his grasp .
But if you come one second after midnight , it will be too late ."
said the lazy , man , and he laughed ; " of course , if we had a horse there would be some chance , but _walk_ all that way ?
" Hello !"
The man called , and whistled , and looked , but no little horse appeared .
Then came trouble !
He would have laid down to sleep again , but he could hear now the howls of hungry wolves in the woods ; that it did not sound pleasant .
Finally , his hand struck against something that felt like a saddle .
It gave him a shudder , and he hesitated ; but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike .
There was still time to reach the castle of fortune , but no more than enough ; so he mounted his new steed and rode on once more .
All its windows were ablaze with lights .
If the man had run for it , he could still have reached the castle , but , instead , he sat still and shouted for a horse .
The clock struck three times .
And as it struck the third note , something came rustling and rattling out of the darkness , something that sounded like a horse with harness .
The man tried to slide off , then , but from all sides of his strange animal great arms came reaching up and held him fast .
Then the great doors shut with a clang , and the castle of fortune was closed for ever to the lazy man .
When King Saul heard these words , he was dismayed , and all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him and were sore afraid .
David heard this , and he asked the men if it were so .
" Go ," said Saul , " and the Lord be with thee !"
Then he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stones out of the brook , and put them in a shepherd ' s bag which he had ; and his sling was in his hand ; and he went out and drew near to the Philistine .
But David looked at him , and answered , " Thou comest to me with a sword , and with a spear , and with a shield ; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts , the God of the armies of Israel , whom thou hast defied .
And then , when the Philistine arose , and came , and drew nigh to meet David , David made haste and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
And after the battle , David was taken to the king ' s tent , and made a captain over many men ; and he went no more to his father ' s house , to herd the sheep , but became a man , in the king ' s service .
And he prayed that he might be shown a man --
Alas !
The hermit felt that his heart was breaking .
Pity and shame leaped up , for the first time , within me .
And when the hermit went home to his mountain , the clown went with him .
The hermit bent his head before the two women , and gave thanks in his heart .
And suddenly a great light came into the hermit ' s mind , and he saw how many ways there are of serving God .
" As he saw the star - like glow Of light , in the cottage windows far , How many God ' s hidden servants are !"
LITTLE GOTTLIEB
Stealing softly from the room he took paper and pen , for he had learnt to write , and spelt out , word after word , a letter which he addressed to the Christ Child .
The Burgomaster opened the envelope , and as he read the letter written in the trembling hand of a child , tears came into his eyes .
The dark green Fir looks so majestic when laden with bright toys and lit up by Christmas candles , that perhaps it is not easy to believe that it is the most modest of trees .
" You ?"
This made the poor Fir very unhappy indeed , and it said , sadly , " Yes , you are right .
Now , quite near to the trees had stood an Angel , who had heard all that had passed .
He was moved to pity the Fir , who was so lowly and without envy of the other trees , and he resolved to help it .
Ever since the first pink blush of dawn , the modest Dewdrop had gazed fixedly down upon the rich gem , but feared to address a person of such exalted consequence .
At last , a large Beetle , during his rambles , chanced to espy the Diamond , and he also recognised him to be some one of great rank and importance .
As the Beetle raised his head from his profound bow , his gaze happened to alight upon the Dewdrop .
The Diamond burst into a rude , contemptuous laugh .
But , even _allowing_ him to possess it , mere beauty without _rank_ is ridiculous and worthless .
I must die of thirst !"
Simple worth is far better than rank or wealth without modesty and unselfishness -- and there is no _true_ beauty where these virtues are absent !"
I
Once more he yawned , and slowly got to his feet and shook himself .
Probably he is the thief himself ."
It was the voice of the Laughing Brook .
" I ' m going fishing ," said he in his deep grumbly - rumbly voice to no one in particular .
He shuffled along over to the Laughing Brook , and straight to a little pool of which he knew , and as he drew near he took the greatest care not to make the teeniest , weeniest bit of noise .
Why , Little Joe Otter to be sure .
" That ' s a very fine looking trout .
" Here ' s your trout , Mr .
But Little Joe wouldn ' t .
Buster didn ' t seem to mind .
He chuckled as if he thought it all a great joke and repeated his invitation to Little Joe to come and get his fish .
But Little Joe just turned his back and went off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage .
" I wonder what I ' d better do with it ."
Then he started down the Laughing Brook to try to catch some for himself .
LITTLE JOE OTTER GETS EVEN WITH BUSTER BEAR
Little Joe Otter was in a terrible rage .
But who wouldn ' t be in a rage if his breakfast was taken from him just as he was about to eat it ?
Of course that wasn ' t nice talk and anything but a nice spirit , but Little Joe Otter ' s temper is sometimes pretty short , especially when he is hungry , and this time he had had no breakfast , you know .
asked Billy Mink .
Just then one of Buster ' s big paws went into the water as quick as a flash and scooped out a trout that had ventured too near .
" He has no business catching _our_ fish !"
Little Joe slipped swiftly into the water and swam straight to the little pool that Buster Bear would try next .
He frightened the fish so that they fled in every direction .
By this time Buster Bear was in fine spirits .
What finer breakfast could any one have than fresh - caught trout ?
But it takes more than three trout to fill Buster Bear ' s stomach , so he kept on to the next little pool .
Oh , my , no !
Farmer Brown ' s boy fished there too , sometimes , and this always made Little Joe and Billy Mink very angry , but they were so afraid of him that they didn ' t dare do anything about it .
But when they discovered that Buster Bear was a fisherman , they made up their minds that something had got to be done .
Sure enough , just as the Jolly Sunbeams began to creep through the Green Forest , he saw Buster Bear coming straight over to the little pool .
So this morning he only went far enough to make sure that if Little Joe were watching for him , as he was sure he would be , he would see him coming .
When they came to the place where Buster was waiting , all he had to do was to scoop them out on to the bank .
He was so intent on looking behind him to see if Buster was coming that he didn ' t see Buster waiting there until he spoke .
Little Joe couldn ' t find a word to say .
So did Grandfather Frog .
He said a lot of unkind things about Buster Bear and about Billy Mink and Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat , because they had laughed at the smartness of Buster .
" He ' s nothing but a great big bully and thief !"
He stole _our_ fish , if you like that any better .
Little Joe couldn ' t find a word to say .
[ Illustration : " You take my advice , Little Joe Otter ," continued Grandfather Frog .
_Page 26 . _ ]
As for all those who live in or along the Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool , they let Little Joe have his own way in everything .
Too bad !
Buster was late that morning .
It seemed to Little Joe that he never would come .
There was the fat trout , and there also was Little Joe ' s smallest cousin , Shadow the Weasel , who is a great thief and altogether bad .
One of the Merry Little Breezes had carried the scent of that fat trout over to him .
Then he came straight over to where the fish lay , his nose wrinkling , and his eyes twinkling with pleasure .
" I -- I hope so ," replied Little Joe .
He knew every pool in the Laughing Brook where the trout love to hide , did Farmer Brown ' s boy , and it was just the kind of a morning when the trout should be hungry .
So he whistled as he tramped along , and his whistle was good to hear .
When he reached the first little pool he baited his hook very carefully and then , taking the greatest care to keep out of sight of any trout that might be in the little pool , he began to fish .
" Either the trout have lost their appetite or they have grown very wise ," muttered Farmer Brown ' s boy , as after a long time he moved on to the next little pool .
" If I didn ' t know that nobody else comes fishing here , I should think that somebody had been here this very morning and caught all the fish or else frightened them so that they are all in hiding ," said he , as he trudged on to the next little pool .
Then he picked up one of the little heads and looked at it sharply .
" I wonder now if Billy Mink is the scamp who has spoiled my fun ."
It was the footprint of Buster Bear .
If he had had his terrible gun with him , it might have been different .
He _was_ being watched .
And Buster Bear was just exactly right .
IX
Little Joe Otter was fairly bursting with excitement .
He could hardly contain himself .
Sure enough , Peter Rabbit was there on one side of the Smiling Pool , making faces at Reddy Fox , who was on the other side , which , of course , was not at all nice of Peter .
Little Joe Otter swam straight to the Big Rock and climbed up to the very highest part .
_Page 45 . _ ]
cried Peter Rabbit .
" Reddy , Reddy , smart and sly , Couldn ' t catch a buzzing fly !"
taunted Peter .
" We know all about that .
What we want to know is what Little Joe Otter has got on his mind ."
For a minute no one said a word .
Then Blacky the Crow leaned down from his perch in the Big Hickory - tree and looked very hard at Little Joe as he said :
" I don ' t believe it .
" I don ' t care whether you believe it or not ; it ' s true ," he retorted .
snapped Blacky the Crow .
BUSTER BEAR BECOMES A HERO
The news that Little Joe Otter told at the Smiling Pool ,-- how Farmer Brown ' s boy had run away from Buster Bear without even seeing him ,-- soon spread all over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest , until every one who lives there knew about it .
Trust Peter for that !
It would be a favor to me which Ah cert ' nly would appreciate ," said Unc ' Billy Possum when he heard the news .
" But you say yourself that Farmer Brown ' s boy didn ' t see Buster Bear , but only his footprint .
Now I ' ve got a plan by which we can see for ourselves if he really is afraid of Buster Bear ."
" What is it ?"
He wants something going on .
Then he has a chance to use that harsh voice of his , and how he does use it !
Now I don ' t say that I don ' t believe it , but I do say that I will be a lot more sure that Farmer Brown ' s boy is afraid of Buster when I see him run away myself .
" To - morrow morning , very early , Sammy Jay and I will make a great fuss near the edge of the Green Forest .
Right away everybody began to talk at the same time .
XII
What was he watching for ?
By and by the back door of Farmer Brown ' s house opened , and out stepped Farmer Brown ' s boy .
In each hand he carried a milk pail .
Blacky didn ' t know what to make of it .
You see , smart as he is and shrewd as he is , Blacky doesn ' t know anything about the meaning of duty , for he never has to work excepting to get enough to eat .
When Farmer Brown ' s boy disappeared in the barn , Chatterer the Red Squirrel snickered right out loud .
This is a great plan of yours , Blacky !
he shouted .
Farmer Brown ' s boy took the two pails of milk into the house , then out he came and started straight for the Green Forest .
He walked very softly so as not to make a sound .
Farmer Brown had laughed and laughed .
I think you must have imagined it ."
It was very exciting , the most exciting thing they could remember .
You see , they had come to believe that Farmer Brown ' s boy wasn ' t afraid of anybody or anything , and as most of them were very much afraid of him , they had hard work to believe that he would really be afraid of even such a great , big , strong fellow as Buster Bear .
A SURPRISING THING HAPPENS
Reddy Fox , lying flat down behind a heap of brush , held _his_ breath .
There was no doubt about it , for with the yell Farmer Brown ' s boy turned and ran for home , as no one ever had seen him run before .
Everybody leaned forward to watch him .
A fallen hero is some one to whom every one has looked up as very brave and then proves to be less brave than he was supposed to be .
That was the way with Buster Bear .
They delighted in flying about through the Green Forest until they had found Buster Bear and then from the safety of the tree tops screaming at him .
How Chatterer did wish that he had kept his tongue still !
The worst of it was there wasn ' t another tree near enough for him to jump to .
And there was no one to help him .
But now as he clung to a little branch near the top of a tall pine - tree in the Green Forest and looked down at the big sharp teeth of Buster Bear drawing nearer and nearer , and listened to the deep , angry growls that made his hair stand on end , Chatterer was too frightened to think .
That is usually the case with those who get into trouble .
" Gr - r - r - r !"
" Oh !
Oh !"
But Chatterer didn ' t think of that .
He spread his arms and legs out just as far as he could , and that kept him from falling as fast and as hard as he otherwise would have done , because being spread out so flat that way , the air held him up a little .
But it was only for a second , and then he was scurrying off as fast as a frightened Squirrel could .
Buster Bear watched him and grinned .
" I didn ' t catch him that time ," he growled , " but I guess I gave him a good fright and taught him a lesson ."
However , it isn ' t a bad habit unless it is carried too far .
Yes , Sir , I need a change .
There is something I ought to have at this time of year , and I haven ' t got it .
I need some fresh fruit .
It must be about berry time now , and I ' d forgotten all about it .
Makes my mouth water just to think of it .
" If I wasn ' t afraid of being seen , I ' d go up to the Old Pasture this very minute .
Then his face brightened .
I can eat all I want and get back to the Green Forest before there is any danger that Farmer Brown ' s boy or any one else I ' m afraid of will see me .
My , I wish to - morrow morning would hurry up and come ."
He was awake even before jolly , round , red Mr . Sun thought it was time to get up , and he was all ready to start for the Old Pasture when the first Jolly Little Sunbeams came dancing across the Green Meadows .
He carried a big tin pail , and in the bottom of it , wrapped up in a piece of paper , was a lunch , for he meant to stay until he filled that pail , if it took all day .
Now the Old Pasture is very large .
Jolly , round , red Mr . Sun had climbed a little way up in the sky by the time Farmer Brown ' s boy reached the Old Pasture , and was smiling down on all the Great World , and all the Great World seemed to be smiling back .
He waited a minute or two , but heard nothing more .
Then he put down his pail and began a hurried look here , there , and everywhere .
Well , I don ' t like to tell you , but he was trying to swallow one of the children of Stickytoes the Tree Toad .
Why , right in the middle of the biggest patch of the biggest blueberries he ever had seen in all his life !
Now if there is any one thing that Buster Bear had rather have above another , it is all the berries he can eat , unless it be honey .
He isn ' t particular what kind of berries .
Raspberries , blackberries , or blueberries , either kind , will make him perfectly happy .
Somehow , time is the hardest thing in the world to remember , when you are having a good time .
They were real berries , and all he had got to do was to help himself .
Yes , it was perfectly harmless .
Buster is so fond of berries that from the very second that his greedy little eyes saw that pailful , he forgot everything but the feast that was waiting for him right under his very nose .
He didn ' t need to be told whose voice that was .
Of course , that meant that he couldn ' t run away , which was the thing of all things he most wanted to do , for big as he is and strong as he is , Buster is very shy and bashful when human beings are around .
He tried to back out of the pail and couldn ' t .
Suddenly it slipped off , so that he could see .
XXI
SAMMY JAY MAKES THINGS WORSE FOR BUSTER BEAR
" Thief , thief , thief !
Sammy Jay was screaming at the top of his lungs , as he followed Buster Bear across the Old Pasture towards the Green Forest .
Blacky beat his wings fiercely and started after Sammy .
And so they reached the edge of the Green Forest , Buster Bear running as hard as ever he could , Sammy Jay flying just behind him and screaming , " Thief , thief , thief !"
Yes , Sir , Buster felt that he was shamed in the eyes of his neighbors , and he wanted nothing so much as to get away by himself , where no one could see him , and try to get rid of that dreadful pail .
Ol ' Mistah Buzzard began to grin as soon as he saw that tin pail on Buster ' s neck .
Even timid little Whitefoot the Wood Mouse was where he could peer out and see without being seen .
A temper is a bad , bad thing When once it gets away .
Buster Bear was in a terrible temper .
But when his temper is aroused and gets away from him , then watch out !
Then the pail had slipped down behind his ears and held fast , so he had run all the way to the Green Forest with it hanging about his neck .
He rushed this way and that way !
And those who were swift of foot , ran .
A few who could neither fly nor climb nor run fast , hid and lay shaking and trembling for fear that Buster would find them .
Then he vented his temper on the tin pail .
He shook himself .
Then he once more fell to knocking it this way and that way , until it was pounded flat , and no one would ever have guessed that it had once been a pail .
Little by little , as he thought it all over , a look of shame crept into his face .
FARMER BROWN ' S BOY LUNCHES ON BERRIES
There are plenty more on the bushes , and all I ' ve got to do is to pick them .
I never was hungrier in my life .
You see , Old Man Coyote had found them and gobbled them up while Farmer Brown ' s boy was away .
Farmer Brown ' s boy gaped foolishly this way and that way .
Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next .
' Well !'
Do you think you could manage it ?)
Down , down , down .
I wish you were down here with me !
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , ' Do cats eat bats ?
thump !
For , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible .
said Alice to herself , rather sharply ; ' I advise you to leave off this minute !'
She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , ' Which way ?
So she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake .
* * * * * * *
And how odd the directions will look !
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming .
Let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is -- oh dear !
London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Rome -- no , THAT ' S all wrong , I ' m certain !
' How cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spread his claws , And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws !'
She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .
' I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears !
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .
' Would it be of any use , now ,' thought Alice , ' to speak to this mouse ?
' I quite forgot you didn ' t like cats .'
cried the Mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice .
She is such a dear quiet thing ,' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , ' and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she ' s such a capital one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your pardon !'
said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation .
A little bright - eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair !
And it ' ll fetch things when you throw them , and it ' ll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things -- I can ' t remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it ' s so useful , it ' s worth a hundred pounds !
Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .
A Caucus - Race and a Long Tale
' I thought you did ,' said the Mouse . '
' Found IT ,' the Mouse replied rather crossly : ' of course you know what " it " means .'
The question is , what did the archbishop find ?'
' Speak English !'
said the Eaglet .
' Why ,' said the Dodo , ' the best way to explain it is to do it .'
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could .
' You are not attending !'
' But you ' re so easily offended , you know !'
Alice called after it ; and the others all joined in chorus , ' Yes , please do !'
Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper !'
' I wish I hadn ' t mentioned Dinah !'
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
Oh my fur and whiskers !
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice , as she went hunting about , and called out to her in an angry tone , ' Why , Mary Ann , what ARE you doing out here ?
But I ' d better take him his fan and gloves -- that is , if I can find them .'
it was too late to wish that !
She went on growing , and growing , and very soon had to kneel down on the floor : in another minute there was not even room for this , and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door , and the other arm curled round her head .
Still she went on growing , and , as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself ' Now I can do no more , whatever happens .
' It was much pleasanter at home ,' thought poor Alice , ' when one wasn ' t always growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and rabbits .
And so she went on , taking first one side and then the other , and making quite a conversation of it altogether ; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside , and stopped to listen .
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs .
Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it .
' THAT you won ' t ' thought Alice , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air .
She did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall , and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber - frame , or something of the sort .
Who ever saw one that size ?
and at last she spread out her hand again , and made another snatch in the air .
This time there were TWO little shrieks , and more sounds of broken glass .
thought Alice .
( a loud crash )--' Now , who did that ?-- It was Bill , I fancy -- Who ' s to go down the chimney ?-- Nay , I shan ' t !
What happened to you ?
' So you did , old fellow !'
I ' ll set Dinah at you !'
So she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly .
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ?'
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation .
' Not a bit ,' said the Caterpillar .
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation .
' Why ?'
' I ' ve something important to say !'
said Alice , swallowing down her anger as well as she could .
' No ,' said the Caterpillar .
' Can ' t remember WHAT things ?'
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice .
Be off , or I ' ll kick you down stairs !'
' And now which is which ?'
* * * * * * *
' Serpent , I say again !'
Ugh , Serpent !'
She felt very curious to know what it was all about , and crept a little way out of the wood to listen .
But at any rate he might answer questions .-- How am I to get in ?'
' I shall sit here ,' the Footman remarked , ' till tomorrow --'
At this moment the door of the house opened , and a large plate came skimming out , straight at the Footman ' s head : it just grazed his nose , and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him .
said Alice .
' Anything you like ,' said the Footman , and began whistling .
And she opened the door and went in .
The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze , were the cook , and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear .
cried Alice , jumping up and down in an agony of terror .
' Talking of axes ,' said the Duchess , ' chop off her head !'
I --'
' IF I don ' t take this child away with me ,' thought Alice , ' they ' re sure to kill it in a day or two : wouldn ' t it be murder to leave it behind ?'
Mind now !'
' If it had grown up ,' she said to herself , ' it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , I think .'
It looked good - natured , she thought : still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth , so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect .
' Would you tell me , please , which way I ought to go from here ?'
' That depends a good deal on where you want to get to ,' said the Cat .
' What sort of people live about here ?'
Alice didn ' t think that proved it at all ; however , she went on ' And how do you know that you ' re mad ?'
' To begin with ,' said the Cat , ' a dog ' s not mad .
' I suppose so ,' said Alice .
' Do you play croquet with the Queen to - day ?'
' You ' ll see me there ,' said the Cat , and vanished .
Alice was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer things happening .
' I thought it would ,' said the Cat , and vanished again .
' All right ,' said the Cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone .
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur .
' You should learn not to make personal remarks ,' Alice said with some severity ; ' it ' s very rude .'
' You might just as well say that " I see what I eat " is the same thing as " I eat what I see "!'
' Two days wrong !'
' It was the BEST butter ,' the March Hare meekly replied .
' It tells the day of the month , and doesn ' t tell what o ' clock it is !'
' Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is ?'
Alice sighed wearily .
(' I only wish it was ,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper .)
Alice asked .
How I wonder what you ' re at !"
' I ' ve heard something like it ,' said Alice .
exclaimed Alice .
' And ever since that ,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone , ' he won ' t do a thing I ask !
A bright idea came into Alice ' s head .
I vote the young lady tells us a story .'
they both cried .
And they pinched it on both sides at once .
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes .
' They couldn ' t have done that , you know ,' Alice gently remarked ; ' they ' d have been ill .'
the Hatter asked triumphantly .
sh !'
' Of course they were ', said the Dormouse ; '-- well in .'
This answer so confused poor Alice , that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it .
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time , and was going off into a doze ; but , on being pinched by the Hatter , it woke up again with a little shriek , and went on : '-- that begins with an M , such as mouse - traps , and the moon , and memory , and muchness -- you know you say things are " much of a muchness "-- did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ?'
I think I may as well go in at once .'
Alice thought this a very curious thing , and she went nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say , ' Look out now , Five !
' I couldn ' t help it ,' said Five , in a sulky tone ; ' Seven jogged my elbow .'
said Seven .
Two began in a low voice , ' Why the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a RED rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the Queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know .
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces .
There was a sound of many footsteps , and Alice looked round , eager to see the Queen .
Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit : it was talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was said , and went by without noticing her .
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners , but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ; ' and besides , what would be the use of a procession ,' thought she , ' if people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they couldn ' t see it ?'
' Leave off that !'
' You make me giddy .'
said the Queen , who had meanwhile been examining the roses .
said Alice , and she put them into a large flower - pot that stood near .
the soldiers shouted in reply .
' That ' s right !'
shouted the Queen .
said a timid voice at her side .
Hush !'
He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke , and then raised himself upon tiptoe , put his mouth close to her ear , and whispered ' She ' s under sentence of execution .'
' Did you say " What a pity !"?'
You see , she came rather late , and the Queen said --'
' Get to your places !'
The players all played at once without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while , and fighting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion , and went stamping about , and shouting ' Off with his head !'
said the Cat , as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with .
said the Cat in a low voice .
' I ' ve read that in some book , but I don ' t remember where .'
So she went in search of her hedgehog .
So she tucked it away under her arm , that it might not escape again , and went back for a little more conversation with her friend .
The moment Alice appeared , she was appealed to by all three to settle the question , and they repeated their arguments to her , though , as they all spoke at once , she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said .
( It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious .)
' You can ' t think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing !'
It means much the same thing ,' said the Duchess , digging her sharp little chin into Alice ' s shoulder as she added , ' and the moral of THAT is --" Take care of the sense , and the sounds will take care of themselves ."'
' A cheap sort of present !'
' Just about as much right ,' said the Duchess , ' as pigs have to fly ; and the m --'
the Duchess began in a low , weak voice .
Then the Queen left off , quite out of breath , and said to Alice , ' Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet ?'
' Up , lazy thing !'
here ,' thought Alice , as she went slowly after it : ' I never was so ordered about in all my life , never !'
' I ' ll tell it her ,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep , hollow tone : ' sit down , both of you , and don ' t speak a word till I ' ve finished .'
So they sat down , and nobody spoke for some minutes .
from the Gryphon , and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle .
' Why did you call him Tortoise , if he wasn ' t one ?'
At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle , ' Drive on , old fellow !
' Yes , we went to school in the sea , though you mayn ' t believe it --'
' Hold your tongue !'
' Yes ,' said Alice , ' we learned French and music .'
said Alice indignantly .
' Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill , " French , music , AND WASHING -- extra ."'
' Reeling and Writhing , of course , to begin with ,' the Mock Turtle replied ; ' and then the different branches of Arithmetic -- Ambition , Distraction , Uglification , and Derision .'
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it , so she turned to the Mock Turtle , and said ' What else had you to learn ?'
' Well , I can ' t show it you myself ,' the Mock Turtle said : ' I ' m too stiff .
' I never went to him ,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh : ' he taught Laughing and Grief , they used to say .'
' THAT generally takes some time ,' interrupted the Gryphon .
' Then , you know ,' the Mock Turtle went on , ' you throw the --'
' Turn a somersault in the sea !'
cried the Mock Turtle , capering wildly about .
yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice .
said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon .
Which shall sing ?'
' I ' ve forgotten the words .'
They are waiting on the shingle -- will you come and join the dance ?
Will you , won ' t you , will you , won ' t you , won ' t you join the dance ?
But the snail replied " Too far , too far !"
Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance .
" There is another shore , you know , upon the other side .
But they HAVE their tails in their mouths ; and the reason is --' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes .--' Tell her about the reason and all that ,' he said to the Gryphon .
Alice was thoroughly puzzled .
' Why , what are YOUR shoes done with ?'
' They ' re done with blacking , I believe .'
' And what are they made of ?'
' Wouldn ' t it really ?'
And the Gryphon added ' Come , let ' s hear some of YOUR adventures .'
She was a little nervous about it just at first , the two creatures got so close to her , one on each side , and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide , but she gained courage as she went on .
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating ' YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM ,' to the Caterpillar , and the words all coming different , and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath , and said ' That ' s very curious .'
' Stand up and repeat "' TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD ,"' said the Gryphon .
' How the creatures order one about , and make one repeat lessons !'
As a duck with its eyelids , so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons , and turns out his toes .'
' She can ' t explain it ,' said the Gryphon hastily .
' But about his toes ?'
' Yes , I think you ' d better leave off ,' said the Gryphon : and Alice was only too glad to do so .
Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ?
Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beauti -- FUL SOUP !'
' What trial is it ?'
' They ' re putting down their names ,' the Gryphon whispered in reply , ' for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial .'
said the King .
' Sixteenth ,' added the Dormouse .
' I keep them to sell ,' the Hatter added as an explanation ; ' I ' ve none of my own .
Here the Queen put on her spectacles , and began staring at the Hatter , who turned pale and fidgeted .
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so , that he shook both his shoes off .
said the King sharply .
' I didn ' t !'
' He denies it ,' said the King : ' leave out that part .'
' I ' m a poor man , your Majesty ,' he began .
' Then you may SIT down ,' the King replied .
' Collar that Dormouse ,' the Queen shrieked out .
said the King , with an air of great relief .
' The trial cannot proceed ,' said the King in a very grave voice , ' until all the jurymen are back in their proper places -- ALL ,' he repeated with great emphasis , looking hard at Alice as he said do .
' What do you know about this business ?'
the King said to Alice .
' Nothing whatever ,' said Alice .
Some of the jury wrote it down ' important ,' and some ' unimportant .'
At this moment the King , who had been for some time busily writing in his note - book , cackled out ' Silence !'
ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT .'
' Nearly two miles high ,' added the Queen .
The King turned pale , and shut his note - book hastily .
' Consider your verdict ,' he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice .
' I haven ' t opened it yet ,' said the White Rabbit , ' but it seems to be a letter , written by the prisoner to -- to somebody .'
' No , they ' re not ,' said the White Rabbit , ' and that ' s the queerest thing about it .'
( The jury all brightened up again .)
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles .
' If any one of them can explain it ,' said Alice , ( she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn ' t a bit afraid of interrupting him ,) ' I ' ll give him sixpence .
he said .
the King added in an offended tone , and everybody laughed , ' Let the jury consider their verdict ,' the King said , for about the twentieth time that day .
said the Queen , turning purple .
' Who cares for you ?'
said Alice , ( she had grown to her full size by this time .)
Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after - time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child - life , and the happy summer days .
For the world of science and evolution is far more nameless and elusive and like a dream than the world of poetry and religion ; since in the latter images and ideas remain themselves eternally , while it is the whole idea of evolution that identities melt into each other as they do in a nightmare .
That object which seemed to be created by the entanglement of two corkscrews was really the key .
There was , however , another man on board , so to speak , at the time .
And now that his luck had lifted him above all the mountains in the society of a wild physicist , he made himself happy still .
This mere space , this mere quantity , terrifies a man more than tigers or the terrible plague .
" Come , come ," said the Professor , encouragingly , " I ' ll help you out .
" It is a new world ," he cried , with a dreadful mirth .
" It is a new planet and it shall bear my name .
This star and not that other vulgar one shall be ' Lucifer , sun of the morning .'
" What can it be ?
There was , as it were , a deadly shock in the fact that there was no shock .
The fog and fire were mixed in a passionate vapour ; you might say that the fog was drowning the flames ; or you might say that the flames had set the fog on fire .
Beside the ship and beneath it ( for it swung just under the ball ), the immeasurable dome itself shot out and down into the dark like a combination of voiceless cataracts .
" Why this ," cried Lucifer , smiting the ball again , " here is the only symbol , my boy .
So fat .
Not like that scraggy individual , stretching his arms in stark weariness ."
The cross is the conflict of two hostile lines , of irreconcilable direction .
The very shape of it is a contradiction in terms ."
After all it is easy enough to see what is really wrong with Wren ' s architectural arrangement ."
" Oh !"
said the monk , a wrinkle coming into his forehead , " so you think that in a rationalistic scheme of symbolism the ball should be on top of the cross ?"
" There is no man like me ," cried Lucifer , with a violence that shook the ship .
" As I was observing ," continued Michael , " this man also took the view that the symbol of Christianity was a symbol of savagery and all unreason .
He said , as you say , that it was an arbitrary and fantastic shape , that it was a monstrosity , loved because it was paradoxical .
And he whirled up his heavy stick and went at it as if at an army .
When he returned to his house he was a literal madman .
He burnt his house because it was made of crosses .
You begin by breaking up the Cross ; but you end by breaking up the habitable world .
" Ah ," he screamed , " to every man his madness .
" I am going ," he said , " to climb up into a star ."
Paradox of this kind is to be found in such a saying as " The meek shall inherit the earth ."
This kind of paradox may be clearly perceived by anybody who happens to be hanging in mid - space , clinging to one arm of the Cross of St . Paul ' s .
Father Michael in spite of his years , and in spite of his asceticism ( or because of it , for all I know ), was a very healthy and happy old gentleman .
And he felt as every man feels in the taut moment of such terror that his chief danger was terror itself ; his only possible strength would be a coolness amounting to carelessness , a carelessness amounting almost to a suicidal swagger .
If he were foolhardy he might escape ; if he were wise he would stop where he was till he dropped from the cross like a stone .
He remembered with a sort of strange pity that this had always been made to mean that whoever lost his physical life should save his spiritual life .
He knew that even his animal life could only be saved by a considerable readiness to lose it .
It is not negative in the least ; it is as positive as good news .
But six times before he reached the highest of the outer galleries terror had returned on him like a flying storm of darkness and thunder .
He thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that gallery with that one man for ever .
Michael realized that the image of God in nickel buttons was asking him how he had come there .
He gave what even Michael ( slight as was his knowledge of the world ) felt to be an improbable account of the sumptuous pleasures and varied advantages awaiting him downstairs .
At one point a door opened .
" The pretty things are downstairs .
He had no notion where or at what level he was .
With that mysterious suddenness of the Cockney mob , a rush was made in the right direction , a dingy office , next to the shop of the potted meat .
The whole peace of the world was pent up painfully in his heart .
Perhaps if he had spoken there for an hour in his illumination he might have founded a religion on Ludgate Hill .
Is there a constable to spare to take care of him ?"
It was in vain that he asked violently , as for the last time , how the statement " God is Spirit " could be reconciled with the statement " The earth is His footstool ."
The little man who edited _The Atheist_ would rush from his shop on starlit evenings and shake his fist at St . Paul ' s in the passion of his holy war upon the holy place .
And he had found his way as far as Fleet Street , seeking some half - promised employment , without having properly realized that there were in the world any people who were not Roman Catholics .
He was somewhat surprised at the lack of deference shown to the figure by the people bustling by .
Or if they had spoken some established blasphemies , he had been unable to understand them merely owing to the preoccupied satisfaction of his mind .
The skies and mountains were the splendid off - scourings of another place .
The stars were lost jewels of the Queen .
His father , the youngest son and the last left alive , had refused to attend on Queen Victoria in Scotland .
" Ah ," he said , after a long pause , " that sort of thing was built under the Stuarts !"
Half an hour afterwards his emotions left him with an emptied mind on the same spot .
He did not see the word " atheist ", or if he did , it is quite possible that he did not know the meaning of the word .
Then followed a paragraph -- but Evan did not understand it .
He read it again and then again .
cried Evan .
" Can you be anything else when you plaster your own house with that God - defying filth ?
Hence , about the mere breaking of an editor ' s window , he was almost uproarious .
" Come , Mr . MacIan , come ," he said , leaning back in his chair , " do you generally enter you friends ' houses by walking through the glass ?"
" He is not my friend ," said Evan , with the stolidity of a dull child .
Mr . Vane shifted sharply in his seat , dropping the eye - glass out of his eye in a momentary and not unmanly embarrassment .
Religion is -- a -- too personal a matter to be mentioned in such a place ."
( Slight applause .)
I call it irreverent , and I ' m not specially orthodox either ."
" I tell you once and for all ," cried Mr . Cumberland Vane , rapping his knuckles angrily on the table , " I tell you , once and for all , my man , that I will not have you turning on any religious rant or cant here .
" You asked me why I broke his window ," said MacIan , with a face of wood .
" I answered , ' Because he blasphemed Our Lady .'
Vane continued to gaze at him with a sternness not habitual to him .
" I really believe you are insane ," said the stipendiary , indignantly , for he had really been doing his best as a good - natured man , to compose the dispute .
" What conceivable right have you to break other people ' s windows because their opinions do not agree with yours ?
Are you necessarily in possession of the truth ?"
He paid down the ten , coin by coin , in silence , and equally silently returned the remaining two to the receptacle .
To me this whole strange world is homely , because in the heart of it there is a home ; to me this cruel world is kindly , because higher than the heavens there is something more human than humanity .
If a man must not fight for this , may he fight for anything ?
The first part of the speech , the bombastic and brutally practical challenge , stunned him with surprise ; but the rest of Evan ' s remarks , branching off as they did into theoretic phrases , gave his vague and very English mind ( full of memories of the hedging and compromise in English public speaking ) an indistinct sensation of relief , as if the man , though mad , were not so dangerous as he had thought .
" To keep the peace ," repeated Evan , " with whom ?"
" Certainly not ," answered MacIan .
( Laughter .)
But it takes two to make a duel , your worship ( renewed laughter ).
He stammered out something , he knew not what ; he only guessed it by the answer of the other .
Night and day I have prayed -- I have longed -- for an atheist revolution -- I have longed to see your blood and ours on the streets .
" But you said ..." began MacIan .
You damned fool , you said things that might have got us locked up for a year , and shadowed by the coppers for half a decade .
" I swear to you , then ," said MacIan , after a pause .
SOME OLD CURIOSITIES
And the shop that stood between the pawnshop and the shop of dreary indecency , showed with quite a blaze of old world beauty , for it was , by accident , a shop not unbeautiful in itself .
Presumably they desired the exact symmetry for some decorative trophy .
" The fact is , Mr . Gordon , we have to place our honour in your hands .
Unfortunately , as the police are in some sense pursuing us , we are hurried , and must fight now and without seconds .
The shopman recovered himself from a stunning surprise and burst out :
" Gentlemen , are you drunk ?
Well , well my religion is a little respect for humanity , and ----"
I do believe in humanity .
Be still !
Be still , I say , or I kill you where you stand ."
The brilliant light ran along the blades , filling the channels of them with white fire ; the combatants stuck their swords in the turf and took off their hats , coats , waistcoats , and boots .
" Jerusalem !"
Evan had worn throughout an air of apathy , which might have been the stale apathy of one who wants nothing .
On guard !"
Turnbull leaped back , but Evan lunged and lunged and lunged again like a devilish piston rod or battering ram .
Murder !
The gag was broken ; and the tongue of terror was loose .
And he saw the archway blocked and blackened with strange figures .
Give me a back ."
And from the shadow of the wall Turnbull crept out .
" Very sorry , sir , but ..." and with that the catlike Turnbull tore him out of his seat and hurled him into the street below , where he lay suddenly stunned .
" Mr . Turnbull ," replied his motionless fare .
At first , I felt a little dazed with the vastness of it all .
But in symbolism as you use it in this instance , I must , I think , concede a certain truth .
We _must_ kill each other -- or convert each other .
But I know you are sincere -- and my soul is mad against you .
Now you _know_ that I am an honest man , and you are mad against me , as I am against you .
They sped on through shining streets that shot by them like arrows .
Mr . Turnbull had evidently a great deal of unused practical talent which was unrolling itself in this ridiculous adventure .
" Mr . MacIan ," he said , " I understand that we have now definitely settled that in the conventional language honour is not satisfied .
All duellists should behave like gentlemen to each other .
" Mr . MacIan ," replied Turnbull , calmly , " no more need be said ."
And he closed the trap once more .
And he began to smoke in the cab .
They had forgotten that there exists in the modern world , perhaps for the first time in history , a class of people whose interest is not that things should happen well or happen badly , should happen successfully or happen unsuccessfully , should happen to the advantage of this party or the advantage of that part , but whose interest simply is that things should happen .
We announce on flaring posters that a man has fallen off a scaffolding .
But the journalistic temperature was steadily and consistently heated by all these influences ; the journalists had tasted blood , prospectively , and were in the mood for more ; everything in the matter prepared them for further outbursts of moral indignation .
etc ."
There fell upon both of them , but upon Turnbull more than the other , because he know more what the scene signified , that quite indescribable sense as of a sublime and passionate and heart - moving futility , which is never evoked by deserts or dead men or men neglected and barbarous , which can only be invoked by the sight of the enormous genius of man applied to anything other than the best .
Those words were from " Songs before Sunrise ".
" Yes ," he said , with a sort of stupidity .
But to see the plain , square , human things as large as that , houses so large and streets so large , and the town itself so large , was like having screwed some devil ' s magnifying glass into one ' s eye .
The two swords with which they had lately sought each other ' s lives were flung down on the grass at random , like two idle walking - sticks .
Turnbull eyed with a certain studious interest , the man who did not understand any of the verbal courtesies ; he lit his pipe and blew great clouds out of it .
" Yes ," he resumed .
" It is not a wrong thing ," said MacIan .
" The point of the sword ," said MacIan , violently , and planted the steel point in the soil like a man planting a tree .
Turnbull tied the last tin of biscuits desperately to himself with string ; and then spoke , like a diver girt for plunging , short and sharp .
This thing has caught on .
For the next six mortal months they will think of nothing but us , as for six mortal months they thought of nothing but the Dreyfus case .
For half a year or more , you and I , Mr . MacIan , will be an obstacle to every reform in the British Empire .
Therefore , do not imagine , in your innocence , that we have only to melt away among those English hills as a Highland cateran might into your god - forsaken Highland mountains .
" Yes ?"
" Let us look at a few final facts .
Beyond that hill there is comparatively clear country .
demanded the leader , again , his face slowly growing as red as his beard ; then he said , suddenly , and in a more human voice , " Are you in pain , MacIan ?"
" Yes ," replied the Highlander , without lifting his face .
" The pain has come into my mind .
" What the devil are you talking about ?"
MacIan broke out with a queer and living voice .
" The hour has come -- the black hour God meant for it .
" And I think less now .
" And what thought ," asked Turnbull , with frantic composure , " occupies what you call your mind ?"
Turnbull ' s face had a sudden spasm in the sunlight , a change so instantaneous that it left no trace behind it ; and his features seemed still carved into a cold stare .
But when he spoke again he seemed like a man who was placidly pretending to misunderstand something that he understood perfectly well .
" Your affection expresses itself in an abrupt form ," he began , but MacIan broke the brittle and frivolous speech to pieces with a violent voice .
" Do not trouble to talk like that ," he said .
Turnbull ' s face flinched again in the fierce sunlight , but his attitude kept its contemptuous ease .
You mean the same yourself .
MacIan bowed patiently , but with burning eyes .
" Do you really mean that if you came to think me right , you would be certainly wrong ?"
" And you are quite certain , I suppose ," continued Turnbull , " that if even you esteem me the esteem would be wholly animal and idle ?"
If I hate you it is because you have hated goodness .
There was a pause , and then MacIan made a movement as if to thrust , and almost at the same moment Turnbull suddenly and calmly dropped his sword .
Evan stared round in an unusual bewilderment , and then realized that a large man in pale clothes and a Panama hat was strolling serenely towards them .
When their weapons rang and riposted in the little London garden , they could have been very certain that if a third party had interrupted them something at least would have happened .
They would have killed each other or they would have killed him .
It was also incongruous with the full and healthy , though rather loose physique of the man who spoke .
At the first glance he looked a fine animal , with curling gold beard and hair , and blue eyes , unusually bright .
And it was only , perhaps , at the hundredth glance that the bright blue eyes , which normally before and after the instant seemed brilliant with intelligence , seemed as it were to be brilliant with idiocy .
But a closer examination of his attire would have shown that even in the tropics it would have been unique ; but it was all woven according to some hygienic texture which no human being had ever heard of before , and which was absolutely necessary even for a day ' s health .
" So you are the young men I have read about in the papers .
A blank silence followed this gay inquiry .
" Now , do you know what I always say to casuists ...?"
Tolstoy has shown that violence merely breeds violence in the person towards whom it is used , whereas Love , on the other hand , breeds Love .
Mr . MacIan , shall we engage ?"
Talk about love , then , till the world is sick of the word .
Christianity is , as far as you are concerned , a horrible mystery .
Keep clear of it , keep silent upon it , as you would upon an abomination .
It is a thing that has made men slay and torture each other ; and you will never know why .
It is a thing that has made men do evil that good might come ; and you will never understand the evil , let alone the good .
And he fell on guard .
" Suppose I call the police ?"
I have heard the word Love pronounced in _his_ intonation ; and I know exactly what it means .
" What noise is that ?"
" I think I know ," replied Turnbull .
What ?"
But the lane was cut deep in the hill and remained in an abrupt shadow .
Then MacIan said : " We run better than any of those policemen .
MacIan turned his long equine face inquiringly .
" Unless what ?"
" They have put the mounted police on us ," said Turnbull , shortly .
" The police have their faults , but thank God they ' re inefficient .
Men who had loved each other and then fought each other ; men who had fought each other and then loved each other , together made a mixed but monstrous sense of momentousness .
" Sir ," he said , " I ought to say something to you .
When the last echo of their eluded pursuers had died in the distant uplands , Turnbull began to unpack the provisions with the easy air of a man at a picnic .
And it was broken by three heavy blows of a stick delivered upon the door .
MacIan ' s long , lean mouth had shut hard .
He had a bow tie so big that the two ends showed on each side of his neck like unnatural stunted wings .
" Let me see ," said Turnbull , looking round to MacIan with the same blandness .
His reddish - brown hair , combed into two great curls , looked like the long , slow curling hair of the women in some pre - Raphaelite pictures .
" I ," said the man , indignantly , " I ' m in my own garden ."
" Oh ," said MacIan , simply , " I apologize ."
" We were just going to fight ."
The little man had a dawning expression of understanding and stooped and picked up the unused bottle of wine , eyeing it curiously .
I know all about the essential requirements of civil order : I have written leading articles about them all my life .
I know all about the sacredness of human life ; I have bored all my friends with it .
But this man thinks that He does exist , and thinking that very properly thinks Him more important than anything else .
Now we wish to make a great demonstration and assertion -- something that will set the world on fire like the first Christian persecutions .
Are you really the two tomfools I have read of in all the papers ?
I ' ll give you a bed !
Ha !
said the small fighter , brandishing his wooden weapon .
" Come on !"
A duel !"
The moment the two duellists had pushed open the door of that inoffensive , whitewashed cottage they found that its interior was lined with fiery gold .
The little man who owned it all threw himself on a heap of scarlet and golden cushions and struck his hands together .
Evan MacIan came out the next morning into the little garden to a fresh silver day , his long face looking more austere than ever in that cold light , his eyelids a little heavy .
Turnbull was in the little house behind him , demolishing the end of an early breakfast and humming a tune to himself , which could be heard through the open window .
He !
asked Turnbull gruffly .
" Yes , my friends ," said the little man , with an animated countenance , fluttering his fingers in the air , " it was no chance that led you to this garden ; surely it was the caprice of some old god , some happy , pitiless god .
" Today his hour is come .
And he bit his forefinger in a kind of fever .
Still , the two duellists stood with their swords as heavily as statues , and the silence seemed to cool the eccentric and call him back to more rational speech .
_Vae Victis ! _ Down , down , down with the defeated !
And I salute the survivor .
" Fight , if you ' re so fond of fighting !
If winning is everything , go in and win !
" Chase him !"
" Chase him over a county !
Up three slanting meadows , down four slanting meadows on the other side , across another road , across a heath of snapping bracken , through a wood , across another road , and to the brink of a big pool , they pursued the flying philosopher .
But when he came to the pool his pace was so precipitate that he could not stop it , and with a kind of lurching stagger , he fell splash into the greasy water .
How jolly it all looks .
" Do you really mean to say , MacIan ," he said , " that you fancied that we , the Free - thinkers , that Bradlaugh , or Holyoake , or Ingersoll , believe all that dirty , immoral mysticism about Nature ?
" It seems to me your most conclusive position ."
" And you mean to tell me ," rejoined the other , " that you broke my window , and challenged me to mortal combat , and tied a tradesman up with ropes , and chased an Oxford Fellow across five meadows -- all under the impression that I am such an illiterate idiot as to believe in Nature !"
Come down to the nearest decent inhabitable pub .
But do you not think that with two pewter pots we might do what we really have never thought of doing yet -- discover what our difference is ?"
" It never occurred to me before ," answered MacIan with tranquillity .
And in the Valencourt Arms festivity itself had some solemnity and decorum ; and beer was drunk with reverence , as it ought to be .
said MacIan in his monotonous way , settling his pewter pot on the table .
Turnbull took his head out of his pewter pot in some anger .
But everyone does know that there is a division between the things that as a matter of fact do commonly happen and the things that don ' t .
For at present you do not understand at all .
He stood silent for a second or two and then resumed .
Man had authority because he was man .
Why do you let a horse be saddled ?"
What you mean is this : that you learnt about all your saints and angels at the same time as you learnt about common morality , from the same people , in the same way .
Did not this system of yours , which you swallowed whole , contain all sorts of things that were merely local , the respect for the chief of your clan , or such things ; the village ghost , the family feud , or what not ?
" But it is not quite true .
said Turnbull .
What are you staring at ?"
" I mean him ."
All your hoary cathedrals , yes , even the Eternal Church on earth is new compared to him .
And in gigantic strides the long , lean Highlander whirled away into the grey twilight , Turnbull following with a good - humoured oath .
But the singular old man with the lank red face seemed to think uncommonly little of the short words .
Atheists !
said the old man with sudden passion .
What they want in England ?
" And you have kept close to something the whole world of today tries to forget ."
" Are you turning an agnostic ?"
We Catholics have only in that sense got as far as realizing that man is a man .
VIII .
Who knows now exactly what Nestorius taught ?
I defy you to go back to the Free - thinkers of the past and find any habitation for yourself at all .
I defy you to read Godwin or Shelley or the deists of the eighteenth century of the nature - worshipping humanists of the Renaissance , without discovering that you differ from them twice as much as you differ from the Pope .
No , the great Free - thinker , with his genuine ability and honesty , does not in practice destroy Christianity .
What he does destroy is the Free - thinker who went before .
Who can discuss whether Emerson was a better optimist than Schopenhauer was pessimist ?
The Church always seems to be behind the times , when it is really beyond the times ; it is waiting till the last fad shall have seen its last summer .
It seems rather hard that having first been told that our creed must be false because we did use tests , we should now be told that it must be false because we don ' t .
The human race has always admired the Catholic virtues , however little it can practise them ; and oddly enough it has admired most those of them that the modern world most sharply disputes .
What then is your real quarrel with Catholicism ?
" Quite so ," replied MacIan with a singular smile .
IX .
Moonrise with a great and growing moon opened over all those flats , making them seem flatter and larger than they were , turning them to a lake of blue light .
The two companions trudged across the moonlit plain for half an hour in full silence .
" That is what I meant ; we are quite alone here .
said the atheistic editor with a sort of gusto of disgust .
" I forgot your prejudices ."
And if here in this moonlight and solitude there happens anything to interrupt us -- if it be lightning striking our sword - blades or a rabbit running under our legs -- I will take it as a sign from God and we will shake hands for ever ."
Turnbull ' s mouth twitched in angry humour under his red moustache .
He said : " I will wait for signs from God until I have any signs of His existence ; but God -- or Fate -- forbid that a man of scientific culture should refuse any kind of experiment ."
And he plucked his sword - point out of the turf .
Turnbull regarded him for a second and a half with a baffling visage almost black against the moonrise ; then his hand made a sharp movement to his hip and his sword shone in the moon .
A small but very neat black - and - yellow motor - car was standing stolidly , slightly to the left of the road .
The fourth , however , had already advanced on the chauffeur of the black - and - yellow car , and was threatening him with a stick .
He had come to know types by instinct and dilemmas with a glance ; he saw the crux of the situation in the road , and what he saw made him redouble his pace .
He knew that the men were rich ; he knew that they were drunk ; and he knew , what was worst of all , that they were fundamentally frightened .
" Oh !
we ' ll take care of the lady ," said the red - faced young man , and went off into gurgling and almost senile laughter .
He lifted his stick and struck at the chauffeur , who caught hold of it , and the drunkard fell backwards , dragging him out of his seat on the car .
It was exactly at this moment that Turnbull fell among them like one fallen from the sky .
With the word the drunkard found his hand that had grasped the stick suddenly twisted and empty ; and the stick lay at the feet of his companion on the other side of the road .
Turnbull was still engaged in countering and pommelling with the third young man .
The fourth young man was still engaged with himself , kicking his legs in helpless rotation on the back of the car and talking with melodious rationality .
If these are annals of military glory , it is due to him to say that he need not have abandoned the conflict ; only that as he backed to the edge of the ditch his foot caught in a loop of grass and he went over in a flat and comfortable position from which it took him a considerable time to rise .
They both swung round abruptly and saw that Turnbull , with his recovered sword under his arm - pit , was already lifting the fallen chauffeur into the car .
The young lady exhibited all the abrupt disturbance of a person who is not commonly disturbed .
A moment afterwards the engine started , with a throb and leap unfamiliar to Turnbull , who had only once been in a motor during a general election , and utterly unknown to MacIan , who in his present mood thought it was the end of the world .
He felt he had been hurled into some new incarnation : into the midst of new relations , wrongs and rights , with towering responsibilities and almost tragic joys which he had as yet had no time to examine .
All these facts were to him certain and incredible , like sacraments .
When they had driven half a mile farther , a big shadow was flung across the path , followed by its bulky owner , who eyed the car critically but let it pass .
she cried out in a kind of temper ; " this car ' s going like a snail ."
" You are driving nobly ," said MacIan , and his words ( which had no meaning whatever ) sounded hoarse and ungainly even in his own ears .
I believe it ' s us ."
" I will tell the lady if you like ," said Turnbull , with his unconquered good temper .
Then the last flattening hammer fell upon poor Evan ' s embarrassment ; for the fluffy brown head with the furry black cap did not turn by a section of the compass .
Her Norman nose was tilted a trifle too high upon the slim stalk of her neck and body .
Nothing seemed to waver or flicker in the fair young falcon profile ; and it only opened its lips to say , after a silence : " I thought people in our time were supposed to respect each other ' s religion ."
But in this case he seemed knocked down by a superior simplicity , as if his eccentric attitude were rebuked by the innocence of a child .
There are such heaps of churches and people thinking different things nowadays , and they all think they are right .
" The time ' s gone by for all that ," she went on ; " you can ' t find out the real thing like that -- if there is really anything to find ----" and she sighed rather drearily ; for , like many of the women of our wealthy class , she was old and broken in thought , though young and clean enough in her emotions .
" What are you taking them up for ?"
Nor did MacIan sit down ; he stood up stunned and yet staring , as he would have stood up at the trumpet of the Last Day .
Sometimes in an outlying house a light in one erratic , unexpected window would give them a nameless hint of the hundred human secrets which they left behind them with their dust .
But still MacIan stood up staring at earth and heaven ; and still the door he had flung open flapped loose like a flag .
" How glorious !"
Evan seemed startled by the stillness , like one who had been born amid sound and speed .
Please come in , if you like -- but I understood that you had some business ."
God knows I have had no pleasure in my life , though I am pretty and young and father has plenty of money .
Or to help some cause or other , which always means bundling people out of crooked houses , in which they ' ve always lived , into straight houses , in which they often die .
I suppose if I actually saw a child drowning I should save it .
" What was the motive ?"
But I may be wrong ; there may be a way out .
And for one stark , insane second , I felt that , after all , you had got the way out and that was why the world hated you .
" You ' ll be all the better for a wash and brush up ."
But the girl had only brushed Evan ' s hand with hers and had fled up the dark alley by the lodge gate .
It seemed impossible that he should ever move .
Turnbull grew restless with this rigidity , and at last , after calling his companion twice or thrice , went up and clapped him impatiently on one of his big shoulders .
" What is the matter with you ?"
" I think I understand you ," said Turnbull , " but you say everything tail foremost ."
" I never liked you so much before ," said MacIan , in bitter sorrow .
Such a world is faintly though fiercely figured in the coloured windows of Christian architecture .
" And now it is a blood - red hand ."
Both the men , according to their several creeds , felt the full thunder of the psalm of life as they had never heard it before ; MacIan felt God the Father , benignant in all His energies , and Turnbull that ultimate anonymous energy , that _Natura Naturans_ , which is the whole theme of Lucretius .
And picking up his sword again , he began striding towards a big bluff of the rocks which stood out upon their left .
" Of course , do whatever you like ," said MacIan , with a choking voice , and he went and walked alone by himself along the wet , glistening sands .
The three walls of rock all leant a little outward , though at various angles ; but this impression was exaggerated in the direction of the incredible by the heavy load of living trees and thickets which each wall wore on its top like a huge shock of hair .
He felt that he could write whole books about the feelings of a single bird .
Both men saluted , and iron rang upon iron .
said Turnbull , stopping an instant , for he had grown used to every movement of his extraordinary fellow - traveller ' s face .
MacIan glanced again at that silver anklet of sea - water and then looked beyond at the next promontory round which a deep sea was boiling and leaping .
" I have noticed it ," said Turnbull with equal sobriety .
It is the finger of God -- red as blood -- still pointing .
" Will you oblige me ," said Turnbull , with staring grey eyes and a voice of distinct and violent politeness ; " will you oblige me by jolly well minding your own business ?
Just you stand up and fight , and we ' ll see who will be washed away like seaweed .
MacIan put his sword between his teeth and plunged after his disappearing enemy .
All night there had been but little lifting in the leaden sea , only now and then the boat had been heaved up , as on a huge shoulder which slipped from under it ; such occasional sea - quakes came probably from the swell of some steamer that had passed it in the dark ; otherwise the waves were harmless though restless .
MacIan , more at home than his companion in this quite barbarous and elemental sort of adventure , had rowed toilsomely with the heavy oars whenever he saw anything that looked like land ; but for the most part had trusted with grim transcendentalism to wind and tide .
Among the implements of their first outfit the brandy alone had remained to him , and he gave it to his freezing companion in quantities which greatly alarmed that temperate Londoner ; but MacIan came from the cold seas and mists where a man can drink a tumbler of raw whisky in a boat without it making him wink .
Bent by necessity to his labour , MacIan managed the heavy boat with real power and skill , and when at length he ran it up on a smoother part of the slope it caught and held so that they could clamber out , not sinking farther than their knees into the water and the shingle .
A few yards from them along the road a lean and starved sort of hedge came pitifully to an end .
" Hurrah !"
said the other , looking at him heavily and with knitted brows , like one almost dazed with the grey doubts of desolate twilight and drifting sea .
" France !"
France , at whose first council table sits the sublime figure of Julian the Apostate .
" France ," said MacIan , " which is one cataract of clear faith from St . Louis to Our Lady of Lourdes ."
France , above all , where men understand the pride and passion which have plucked our blades from their scabbards .
" Yes ," he cried , in a voice of thunder , " we will fight here and _He_ shall look on at it ."
" If the French police like to interfere , let them interfere .
This is the island called St . Loup , sir , an island in the Channel .
" Quite so ," said Turnbull , and lurched suddenly against the sergeant , so as to tip him over the edge of the road with a crash into the shingle below .
As they were both good runners , the start they had gained was decisive .
They had run another half mile or so when it became apparent that they were entering a sort of scattered village .
" I mean ," said Turnbull , with steady conviction , " that what we want is a little diplomacy , and I am going to buy some in a shop ."
He was stout ; he was quite undistinguished ; and he had side - whiskers , worn just a little longer than John Bull ' s .
If you had asked him about government , he would have said that all citizens were free and equal , but he would have meant what he said .
But Durand was anything but a fool ; he had read all the eighteenth century , and could have defended his platitudes round every angle of eighteenth - century argument .
Both the father and the daughter were of the sort that would normally have avoided all observation ; that is , all observation in that extraordinary modern world which calls out everything except strength .
The father with his square face and grey side whiskers , the daughter with her square face and golden fringe of hair , were both stronger than they know ; stronger than anyone knew .
The daughter believed in God ; and was even stronger .
She trod firmly as if going somewhere ; she flung her face back as if defying something ; she hardly spoke a cross word , yet there was often battle in her eyes .
The modern man asked doubtfully where all this silent energy went to .
He haunted her , however ; especially at church , which was , indeed , one of the few certain places for finding her .
In her home she had a habit of being invisible , sometimes through insatiable domesticity , sometimes through an equally insatiable solitude .
M . Bert did not give the impression of a pious man , though he did give , especially with his eyes , the impression of an honest one .
He was a large , lean man , with the stoop of an aged eagle , and even the eagle ' s nose to complete it ; he had old - fashioned military whiskers and moustache dyed with a garish and highly incredible yellow .
Despite his silence and his dandified dress and whiskers , the island might never have heard of him but for the extraordinary event of which I have spoken , which fell about in the following way :
In such casual atmospheres only the enthusiastic go to Benediction ; and as the warm blue twilight closed over the little candle - lit church and village , the line of worshippers who went home from the former to the latter thinned out until it broke .
She was not in the least afraid of loneliness , because she was not afraid of devils .
In a clearing of the wood , however , which was lit up with a last patch of the perishing sunlight , there advanced upon her suddenly one who was more startling than a devil .
I am a man who knows no limit ; I am the most callous of criminals , the most unrepentant of sinners .
But my dominions stretch from the olives of Italy to the fir - woods of Denmark , and there is no nook of all of them in which I have not done a sin .
A short but nimble figure came along the woodland path like a humming bullet and had caught Count Gregory a crack across the face before his own could be recognized .
" Certainly , you need remind me of nothing ," answered Camille , stolidly .
" We are detaining the lady ," said Count Gregory , with politeness ; and , making a gesture suggesting that he would have taken off his hat if he had had one , he strode away up the avenue of trees and eventually disappeared .
" You must allow me to see you home ," said Bert to the girl , in a gruff and almost stifled voice ; " I think we have only a little way to go ."
" Sir ," she began , " it is not wrong of me to speak to you ," and the very words gave him a jar of unexpected truth ; for in all the novels he had ever read she would have begun : " It is wrong of me to speak to you ."
It ' s all so different -- having a reason -- and letting the other man know -- and using the same guns and things -- and doing it in front of your friends .
I ' m awfully stupid , but I know that men like you aren ' t murderers .
I know nothing about when you ought to die .
Nor did he , strictly speaking , say it in English .
The truth ( interesting only to anthropologists ) is that he said it in Scotch .
" You always go to Mass ," answered the girl , opening her wide blue eyes , " and the Mass is very long and tiresome unless one loves God ."
" I do not love God ," he cried , speaking French with the broadest Scotch accent ; " I do not want to find Him ; I do not think He is there to be found .
cried the man , " and I tell you God is a lie and a fable and a mask .
It ' s just like my damned luck .
The police are after me ; not for atheism but for being ready to fight for it ."
" I want you to hate me !"
" Why , I touched His body only this morning ."
The two got a good start up the road before the whole town was awakened behind them ; and half - way up it a similar transformation was seen to take place in Mr . Turnbull ' s singular umbrella .
How he knew he was another gentleman merely by banging into him , must remain a mystery .
The other was a very drunk and very wealthy English gentleman .
" You seem to be in a hurry ," said the unknown Englishman , falling back a step or two in order to laugh with an unnatural heartiness .
" What ' s it all about , eh ?"
" You ' ll find it in harbour ," said Wilkinson , struggling with his speech .
Evan ' s mind went through a crisis of instantaneous casuistry , in which it may be that he decided wrongly ; but about how he decided his biographer can profess no doubt .
XII .
" I didn ' t know there were any Atlantic islands so far beyond the Scillies -- Good Lord , it can ' t be Madeira , yet ?"
" I know what I am thinking , anyhow .
" What are you thinking ?"
" I am thinking and you are thinking ," said Turnbull , " that it is damned silly to waste all that champagne ."
There were no ladies or policemen here to give him a hint either of its farce or its tragedy .
And till the time comes this place shall be sacred ."
But Turnbull being of a more active and birdlike type of mind did throw a glance round the scene .
" I do not want to stop now ," said the other , in his elephantine simplicity , " but we must stop for a moment , because it is a sign -- perhaps it is a miracle .
They clambered down the rocky peninsula and trudged along the sandy isthmus with the plodding resolution of men who seemed almost to have made up their minds to be wanderers on the face of the earth .
Despite Turnbull ' s air of scientific eagerness , he was really the less impatient of the two ; and the Highlander went on well ahead of him with passionate strides .
By the time they had walked for about half an hour in the ups and downs of those dreary sands , the distance between the two had lengthened and MacIan was only a tall figure silhouetted for an instant upon the crest of some sand - dune and then disappearing behind it .
Do you mean an oyster ?"
Then five minutes passed , and then seven minutes ; and MacIan bit his lip and swung his sword , and the other did not reappear .
And he went off again into convulsions of his humorous ailment .
Buck up , old man , this story of ours is a switchback .
He suddenly altered from a staring statue to a leaping man of the mountains .
They had no easy business , however ; for the bottle which they had so innocently sent into the chief gate of Thanet had called to life the police of half a county on their trail .
From every side across the grey - green common figures could be seen running and closing in ; and it was only when MacIan with his big body broke down the tangled barrier of a little wood , as men break down a door with the shoulder ; it was only when they vanished crashing into the underworld of the black wood , that their hunters were even instantaneously thrown off the scent .
Then MacIan stood utterly still and listened , as animals listen , for every sound in the universe .
And when at last he lay down on the hard earth , sleep struck him senseless like a hammer .
* * *
A wash of weary daylight was breaking over the country - side , and the fields and roads were full of white mist -- the kind of white mist that clings in corners like cotton wool .
Nothing short of a brick wall could have abruptly brought him up .
But he was pursuing his shadow or the wind ; for Turnbull had put one foot in a crack of the tree and gone up it as quickly and softly as a cat .
But higher yet behind them , and readier to catch the first coming of the sun , ran the rampart of the top of the wall , which in their excitement of escape looked at once indispensable and unattainable , like the wall of heaven .
The nightmare of the stone horse was increased by the white fog , which seemed thicker inside the wall than outside .
Anything would serve , however , that was likely to confuse their trail , so they both decided without need of words to use this tree also as a ladder -- a ladder of descent .
As it thinned yet farther they saw that it was only flowers ; but flowers in such insolent mass and magnificence as can seldom be seen out of the tropics .
he said , at last .
" You can extend to us your pardon ," he said , for he also came of a whole race of gentlemen -- of gentlemen without shirts to their backs .
" I suppose I am not wrong , sir ," continued MacIan , " in supposing that these grounds inside the wall belong to you ?"
The man in the panama looked at the ground and smoked thoughtfully for a few moments , after which he said , with a sort of matured conviction :
" A large proprietor ."
Turnbull ' s eye grew even more offensive , and he began biting his red beard ; but MacIan seemed to recognize a type with which he could deal and continued quite easily :
This seeming host of theirs might comprehend a quarrel of husband and lover or a difficulty at cards or even escape from a pursuing tailor ; but it still remained doubtful whether he would feel the earth fail under him in that earthquake instant when the Virgin is compared to a goddess of Mesopotamia .
The face of the old gentleman had grown redder and redder during this address , but it was still smiling ; and when he broke out it was with a kind of guffaw .
said MacIan , with his simple monstrosity of speech ; " all man ' s worship began when the Garden of Eden was founded ."
And he went stamping up and down the garden , making it echo with his unintelligible laughter .
" I understood that this garden ----" began the bewildered MacIan .
So do the sun and stars ."
But after staring steadily for an instant Turnbull saw the hard and horrible earnestness in the man ' s eyes behind all his empty animation .
Then he looked at MacIan .
He had the look of a prosperous banker , wore a good tall silk hat , was almost stout enough to burst the buttons of a fine frock - coat ; but he was talking to himself , and one of his elbows had a singular outward jerk as he went by .
But in my position one has to meet so many people .
One has to be broadminded ."
" Yes , by God , MacIan , I think we have come to the right place !"
Turnbull was moodily balancing his sword in his hand as the other spoke ; then he started , for a mouth whispered quite close to his ear .
I know the story he ' ll tell ; I overheard it when the housekeeper was talking to the postman .
" Sir !"
spluttered the genteel lunatic ; " teeth ?"
Why are measles catching ?
Turnbull went on like a torrent .
Fifty sailors were drowned off Selsey Bill .
God is not good enough .
" Do you doubt my word ?"
" I do not doubt it in the least ," answered MacIan .
" You are always hard to follow ," remarked Turnbull , genially , " and sometimes so much so as to be hardly worth following ."
" I alone am loyal ," insisted MacIan ; " for I alone am in rebellion .
And folding his arms and throwing back his lean , hawklike face , he haughtily confronted the man with the formal frock - coat and the eccentric elbow .
" What right had you stunted German squires ," he cried , " to interfere in a quarrel between Scotch and English and Irish gentlemen ?
Where are the corpses of Culloden ?
MacIan advanced upon his opponent with a bony and pointed finger , as if indicating the exact pocket in which the blood of that Cameron was probably kept ; and Edward VII fell back a few paces in considerable confusion .
MacIan strode after him still preaching and flourishing his large , lean hands .
But for the crooked glasses his dress was always exquisite ; and but for the smile he was perfectly and perennially depressed .
" It is rather a long story ," said Turnbull , smiling .
The new - comer started slightly , and Turnbull replied to the question on his face .
He did not look up , but his comrade and enemy addressed him like one who must free himself of his feelings .
For one instant MacIan opened the eyes of battle ; then his tightened lips took a crooked smile and he said , quite calmly :
" Then , what ," asked Turnbull , very slowly , as he softly picked a flower , " what is the difference between Christ and Satan ?"
What I want to point out is , that your faith does end in asylums and my science doesn ' t ."
" Do you really believe it ?"
" I ' ve been walking about the garden talking to a poor chap all the morning .
But he doesn ' t exist ."
Turnbull sprang to his feet and was like one who is speechless through choking a sudden shout of laughter .
said Turnbull , heartily , " of course we ' re not mad .
No , if we manage this very quietly , he may merely let us out at the front door as stray revellers .
If there ' s half an hour of inquiry , we are cooked ."
" If you really want to put anything before me , I can give you a few moments in my consulting - room ."
There was one desk occupied with carefully docketed papers ; and there were several chairs of the red - varnished wood -- though of different shape .
All along the wall ran something that might have been a bookcase , only that it was not filled with books , but with flat , oblong slabs or cases of the same polished dark - red consistency .
We are the hares , and , seeing your high wall look so inviting , we tumbled over it , and naturally were a little startled with what we found on the other side ."
said the doctor , mildly .
" I can understand that you were startled ."
As the doctor did not ask the question , he grew slightly uneasy , and risked the question : " I hope you will accept my assurance that the thing was an accident and that no intrusion was meant ."
MacIan took one stride to the table , leant across it , and said : " We can ' t stop here , we ' re not mad people !"
" Oh , yes ," he said , " very thoroughly ."
They were : " MacIan , Evan Stuart ."
Evan bent his angry eagle face over it ; yet something blurred it and he could never swear he saw it distinctly .
Grandfather believed in return of the Stuarts .
Then he compressed his temples with his hands , as if to crush them .
" Very well ," he cried ; " I will take the sour with the sweet .
His mother , I swear , had no relics .
After the name , the inscription appeared to run : " Unique case of Eleutheromania .
And they will see that we do not get out ."
The system of espionage in the asylum was so effective and complete that in practice the patients could often enjoy a sense of almost complete solitude .
It is a question of a certain solid and childish fancy .
The sun is in the strict and literal sense invisible ; that is to say , that by our bodily eyes it cannot properly be seen .
Then he thought it was a falling star ; only it did not fall .
It was of pure white steel , and in the moon it gleamed like the armour of Sir Galahad .
" Evan ," said the voice , and it spoke with the simple authority of some forgotten father revisiting his children , " you have remained here long enough , and your sword is wanted elsewhere ."
asked the young man , accepting the monstrous event with a queer and clumsy naturalness ; " what is my sword wanted for ?"
" For all that you hold dear ," said the man standing in the moonlight ; " for the thrones of authority and for all ancient loyalty to law ."
" They are all very beautiful ," said Evan , as if in doubt .
" The Stuart ----" began Evan , earnestly .
" Yes ," answered the old man , " that which has returned is Stuart and yet older than Stuart .
It is Richard , the last Plantagenet , giving his crown to Bolingbroke as to a common brigand .
" Look out and see ," said the guide .
They were driving through the air towards one region of the sky where the hollow of night seemed darkest and which was quite without stars .
As the flying ship swept round the dome he observed other alterations .
All the old blackcoated bustle with its cockney vivacity and vulgarity had disappeared .
But one old grumbling man did not get out of the way quick enough , and the man on horseback struck him , not severely , across the shoulders with the flat of his sword .
Discipline for the whole society is surely more important than justice to an individual ."
" Discipline for society ----" he repeated , very staccato , " more important -- justice to individual ?"
" I am an angel ," said the white - robed figure , without turning round .
" Go on !"
" No ," said Evan , quite composedly , " I desire a miracle ."
" And how do you know ," he said , " how do you know that I am not God ?"
MacIan screamed .
XVI .
THE DREAM OF TURNBULL
His heart was in the right place ; but he was quite content to leave it there .
It was his head that was his hobby .
Long strips and swirls of tattered and tawny cloud were dragged downward to the west exactly as torn red raiment would be dragged .
" Excuse my not being in evening dress ," said the newcomer with an urbane smile .
" Look here ," said Turnbull , sturdily clenching his fists in his trousers pockets , " I am bound to expect lunatics inside these four walls ; but I do bar their coming from outside , bang out of the sunset clouds ."
asked Turnbull , with an explosion of temper as sudden as a pistol shot .
" I want exactly what you want ," said the new - comer with a new gravity .
he said to himself .
To some cause he could never explain he found himself completing the sentence on the top of the wall , having automatically followed the stranger so far .
" We are going to destroy the Pope and all the kings ," said the new - comer .
The boys never really dared to defy the schoolmaster ."
asked Turnbull .
But when they looked down at the earth they saw it growing darker and darker .
The lunatic asylum in its large rectangular grounds spread below them in a foreshortened and infantile plan , and looked for the first time the grotesque thing that it was .
The masses of rose or rhododendron deepened from crimson to violet .
said he ; " and if once everything is upset , He will be upset on top of it ."
Then , as Turnbull made no answer , his host continued :
Turnbull stood in an attitude which might well have meant pitching the other man out of the flying ship .
" I have always been an atheist .
The other continued still unruffled , and staring over the edge idly as an angler stares down at a stream .
The man laid himself back in his reposeful attitude , and said :
" What was it that you always meant on those million and one nights when you walked outside your Ludgate Hill shop and shook your hand in the air ?"
" Quite so ," said Turnbull , in a rather colourless voice .
When at length they had risen high enough to have a bird ' s - eye view of the whole campaign , Turnbull was already intoxicated .
he asked , breathlessly .
Employ the employables .
" Going on splendidly ," replied his companion in the heartiest voice .
Somewhat to the speaker ' s surprise this did not inflame the sensitive sceptic ; he had the air of thinking thoroughly , and then he said : " No , I don ' t think it ' s my friend MacIan that taught me that .
These people have rights ."
Then he added with a more open sneer : " Perhaps they also have souls ."
" They have lives !"
Can you , as a free - thinker , find any fault in that ?"
he said , quite calmly , like on stopping an omnibus .
" Do you want to be taken to a monastery ," snarled the other , " with MacIan and his winking Madonnas ."
" I want to be taken to a madhouse ," said Turnbull distinctly , giving the direction with a sort of precision .
At last he said , very gravely : " Do you think I am the devil ?"
For some incredible moments stars and space and planets seemed to shoot up past him as the sparks fly upward ; and yet in that sickening descent he was full of some unnatural happiness .
XVII .
Evan MacIan was standing a few yards off looking at him in absolute silence .
The two men came slowly towards each other , and found the same expression on each other ' s faces .
" You mean treated worse , I suppose ," said Turnbull , gruffly .
Behave not only more sanely than any of your patients , but more sanely than half the sane men outside , and you have the soul - stifling cheek to say that they give anxiety ."
MacIan took one of his immense strides forward and stood over the doctor with flaming eyes .
Let us see the head of the asylum ."
" See the head of the asylum ," repeated Dr . Quayle .
" You don ' t seem to appreciate the peculiar advantages of my position as a lunatic ," he said .
" Oh , certainly ," he said with a weak laugh .
" You can see the head of the asylum if you particularly want to ."
It was only for a flash that his face was thus lifted .
But in the white wall there were two iron doors painted white on which were written , respectively , in neat black capitals B and C .
Then , when silence had sunk deep and nothing happened for two and a half hours , it suddenly occurred to him that this was the end of his life .
For these great scientific organizers insisted that a man should be healthy even if he was miserable .
They administered air in secret , but in sufficient doses , as if it were a medicine .
I shall be here till I rot .
It was a long , narrow parallelogram , which had a flat wall at one end and ought to have had a flat wall at the other ; but that end was broken by a wedge or angle of space , like the prow of a ship .
He soon discovered that these air - holes were all the ends and mouths of long leaden tubes which doubtless carried air from some remote watering - place near Margate .
Thus the Prussian monarchy in the eighteenth century , or now , can make a strong army merely by making the men afraid .
He had felt a high fit of pride and poetry , which had ebbed away and left him deadly cold .
He thought of leaving in the cell when he died a rigid record of his opinions , and when he began to write them down on scraps of envelope in his pocket , he was startled to discover how much they had changed .
Then for an instant there hung and broke above him like a high wave the whole horror of scientific imprisonment , which manages to deny a man not only liberty , but every accidental comfort of bondage .
Here the unpierceable walls were washed every morning by an automatic sluice .
But all the time he had never once doubted that the five sides of his cell were for him the wall of the world henceforward , and it gave him a shock of surprise even to discover the faint light through the aperture in the ventilation tube .
Turnbull thrust his first finger down the aperture , and at last managed to make a slight further fissure in the piping .
" I say , Turnbull , we couldn ' t fight through this tube , could we ?"
Then he said with his old gaiety : " I vote we talk a little first ; I don ' t want to murder the first man I have met for ten million years ."
" I am sure it ' s not the same as anybody ' s ," said Turnbull , " for it has no rhyme or reason .
" It looked so unnecessary ."
" You must be ghastly strong ," said Turnbull .
asked Turnbull .
Machinery brought them their cocoa and cleaned their cells ; that machinery was as helpless as it was pitiless .
" James Turnbull ," said MacIan , in a low and shaken voice , " these people hate us more than Nero hated Christians , and fear us more than any man feared Nero .
A cold and quivering impatience continued to crawl up Turnbull ' s spine ; he had never felt so near to superstition and supernaturalism , and it was not a pretty sort of superstition either .
I expect these iron handles that we both hate have been part of some damned machinery for walling him up .
On the same kind of tiled floor , of which the monotonous squares had maddened Turnbull ' s eye and brain , was sitting a figure which was startlingly short even for a child , only that the enormous head was ringed with hair of a frosty grey .
The lines of his face were so deep and complex that one could see five or ten different faces besides the real one , as one can see them in an elaborate wall - paper .
The hilarious energy in this idiot attitude gave Turnbull another sick turn .
" Squares very good ; I have a nice long holiday , and can count them .
The words Turnbull spoke broke out of him in pure pity .
" Can ' t we do anything for you ?"
he said .
" I am very happy ," said the other , alphabetically .
Can I help you ?"
" Good day ."
His brain ' s like a pin - point now ."
said MacIan .
shouted Turnbull with a sudden and furious energy .
At the sight of the escape these two subordinates uttered a cry and sprang forward , but their superior remained motionless and smiling , and somehow the lack of his support seemed to arrest and freeze them in the very gesture of pursuit .
Let them take the wings of the morning and abide in the uttermost parts of the sea -- I am there .
Turnbull swung round with great abruptness to the other two doctors , and said , harshly : " What in snakes does he mean -- and who are you ?"
" I suppose you think that quite a simple question ," he said .
" Well , I don ' t see that it can do any harm to tell you know ," he said .
" Well ," continued Dr . Hutton , " the Master described before both Houses of Parliament the real scientific objection to all existing legislation about lunacy .
Insanity , like forgetfulness , is simply a quality which enters more or less into all human beings ; and for practical purposes it is more necessary to know whose mind is really trustworthy than whose has some accidental taint .
" And you mean to say ," cried Turnbull , with a vibrant snort , " that that proposal was passed in an assembly that calls itself democratic ?"
Turnbull gave one stamp upon the gravel , then pulled himself together , and resumed : " But why should your infernal head medicine - man lock us up in separate cells while he was turning England into a madhouse ?
" Well ?"
" Eh !"
" Confound him !
The cursed pack of rat - catching chemists all say that I ' ve lost my wits ."
asked Turnbull .
What put the country into such a state ?"
" What put the country into such a state ?"
A white early moon was hardly traceable upon that delicate yellow .
Now the star had gone out , and there was only misery .
" What things ?"
asked the other , incredulously .
" I saw _her_ ," he said , " three minutes ago -- walking here in this hell yard ."
" I saw her walk behind those blessed trees against that holy sky of gold as plain as I can see her whenever I shut my eyes .
" My dear fellow ," cried Turnbull , rallying a hearty laugh , " the fancies have really got hold of you .
Turnbull ' s tawny eyebrows were pulled together with a peculiar frown of curiosity , and all at once he walked quickly across the lawn .
The moment that he touched it he knew that he was sane even if the solar system was crazy .
I ' m a lunatic ."
Then she composed her features , and replied with equal dignity : " Well , if it comes to that , why are you ?"
But though they two were as isolated as a new Adam and Eve in a pretty ornamental Eden , the lady did not relax by an inch the rigour of her badinage .
" Oh , you can see my certificate if you like ," she replied with some hauteur .
The pure lemon of the sky faded into purer white as the great sunset silently collapsed .
" If it is really always to be like this ," he said , thickly , " it would not matter if we were here for ever ."
" You tried to kill yourself four times for me ," she said , unsteadily , " and I have been chained up as a madwoman for you .
I really think that after that ----"
" My name is Beatrice Drake ," she replied with complete gravity .
As he skirted a low hedge of laurel , an enormously tall young man leapt over it , stood in front of him , and almost fell on his neck as if seeking to embrace him .
The tall man sitting on the gravel bowed with urbanity , and said : " Quite at your service .
Not to be confused with the Wilkinsons of Cumberland ; and as I say , old boy , what have you done with my yacht ?
And with flying frock - coat he led Turnbull rapidly round the corner of a path .
It ' s very sad , and I ' m afraid utterly incurable .
Dr . Quayle swung round for an instant so that his silk - lined overcoat rustled , and stared singularly at Turnbull .
He did not think ; he did not even very definitely desire .
Into the middle of his stationary and senseless enjoyment were thrust abruptly the projecting elbow and the projecting red beard of Turnbull .
I ' ve met the fellow Wilkinson , whose yacht we lost .
" Be silent !
or I shall say it all wrong ," said MacIan , breathing hard .
I don ' t say this is really the end of the world , but it ' s something like that -- it ' s the end of something .
Turnbull , three days ago I saw quite suddenly that our duel was not right after all ."
" When and why did this illumination occur ?"
" Do you mean the poor old idiot who likes spikes to stick out ?"
It would have been a venial sin ."
I am a little mad ."
Compared with the general public , I might positively be called sane ."
He stopped again , and went on with the same air of travailing with the truth :
Torture should be violently stopped , though the Church is doing it .
Now , by God !
Let the rationalists run their own race , and let us see where _they_ end .
Does the world find it ?
" Does the world stand on its own end ?
Turnbull did not move his head , and he had been listening all the time ; yet , somehow , the other knew that for the first time he was listening seriously .
That is why they have turned ten counties to a madhouse ; that is why crowds of kindly people are poured into this filthy melting - pot .
Turnbull for the first time started .
His voice was for the first time devoid of irony .
Within a few feet of him at one corner of the square of standing people stood the girl he had known in Jersey , Madeleine Durand .
She looked straight at him with a steady smile which lit up the scene of darkness and unreason like the light of some honest fireside .
He saw her first , and for a few seconds saw her only ; then the outer edge of his eyesight took in all the other staring faces , and he saw all the faces he had ever seen for weeks and months past .
" The place is covered with machine - guns .
I dare say ," said Hutton .
" A cosy party ," resumed the Master , scornfully , " and yet I believe some of you are in doubt about how we all came together .
But the popular excitement about the alleged duel continued , and we had to fall back on our old historical method .
He is a victim of the disease called Vinculomania -- the impression that one has been bound or tied up .
We have taken in hand every person who professed to have seen such a thing , and proved them all to be unbalanced .
That is why they are here ."
Then he suddenly swung it above his head and sent it at the inquiring doctor with an awful crash which sent one of its wooden legs loose along the floor and crammed the doctor gasping into a corner .
MacIan gave a great shout , snatched up the loose chair - leg , and , rushing on the other doctor , felled him with a blow .
Twenty attendants rushed to capture the rebels ; MacIan flung back three of them and Turnbull went over on top of one , when from behind them all came a shriek as of something quite fresh and frightful .
How can it have happened ?"
" Oh , how should I know !"
" Then I will tell you ," said Turnbull ; " it happened because some people fancied that a French grocer was as respectable as he looked ."
They will leave us in charge of the machinery and the machine - guns at the windows .
" The keepers have gone already ," said Turnbull .
This is a successful revolution ."
Turnbull looked once at Madeleine , and followed .
MacIan , with singed hair , smoking garments , and smarting hands and face , had already broken far enough through the first barriers of burning timber to come within cry of the cells he had once known .
When he heard it he rushed forward as if to plunge into that furnace , but Turnbull arrested him by an elbow .
repeated Turnbull , grimly .
In the heart of that white - hot hell he was singing like a bird .
" Father ," he shouted , " come out and save us all !"
The fire , though it had dropped in one or two places , was , upon the whole , higher and more unconquerable than ever .
The towers and domes of the oppressive smoke seemed high and far enough to drown distant planets in a London fog .
For while one half of the huge fire sloped one way towards the inland heights , the other half , at exactly the same angle , sloped out eastward towards the sea .
But now the fire was turned to left and right like a woman ' s hair parted in the middle , and now the shafts of its light could shoot up into empty heavens and strike anything , either bird or cloud .
All the eager , upturned faces watched the two dots as they grew bigger and bigger in their downward rush .

It must not be supposed that Dr Hood ' s apartments excluded luxury , or even poetry .
Everything about him and his room indicated something at once rigid and restless , like that great northern sea by which ( on pure principles of hygiene ) he had built his home .
I ' ve come about that business of the MacNabs .
" Why , her mother won ' t let them get engaged ."
The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly , but the eyes under them were bright with something that might be anger or might be amusement .
The great Orion Hood ' s scientific triumphs had deprived him of many things -- some said of his health , others of his God ; but they had not wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd .
Tell me your story ."
At present she has only one lodger , the young man called Todhunter ; but he has given more trouble than all the rest , for he wants to marry the young woman of the house ."
The dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort , for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door .
This story is told by the family with the fiercest mystification ; but I really think Mrs MacNab prefers her own original tale : that the Other Man ( or whatever it is ) crawls out every night from the big box in the corner , which is kept locked all day .
A particular flower may not be dead in early winter , but the flowers are dying ; a particular pebble may never be wetted with the tide , but the tide is coming in .
Her apology was almost as abrupt as a command .
" James has been murdered , for all I can make out ," answered the girl , still breathing hard from her rush .
" This is very serious ," said Father Brown , gathering his errant hat and umbrella and standing up ; " in point of fact I was just putting your case before this gentleman , and his view --"
" I do not think this young lady is so Celtic as I had supposed .
Then he stepped swiftly across the carpet , picked up the tall silk hat , and gravely put it upon the head of the yet pinioned Todhunter .
That hat is of a stylish shape and systematically brushed and burnished , though not very new .
" But , good heavens !"
I might rely in some degree on the story of his previous appearance at the window , as a tall man in a silk hat , but I think I have more exact indication .
This wineglass has been smashed all over the place , but one of its splinters lies on the high bracket beside the mantelpiece .
" By the way ," said Father Brown , " might it not be as well to untie Mr Todhunter ?"
But , as it happens , we may go farther .
These two men have met here today and have quarrelled , using blows and a bare weapon ."
Dr Hood replaced the silk hat carefully on the side table , and went across to the captive .
Second ," he continued , moving towards the window , " this is the only exit , and it is locked on the inside .
Third , this blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point , but there is no wound on Mr Todhunter .
It is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus , rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden egg .
" But the ropes ?"
Well , I will tell her .
cried the audience on quite different notes of astonishment .
It was rather that creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beginnings of an idea .
" That is what I mean ," said the doctor .
" Jerusalem !"
" You brutes ; I believe it ' s hurting him !"
" Not that , I think ," said Dr Hood ; " the eyes have certainly a singular expression .
" Well ," replied the Reverend Brown apologetically , " not to put too fine a point on it , I think he is laughing at you .
Indeed , the mere facts are rather commonplace and comic by comparison ."
Orion Hood broke into a contemptuous laugh .
" I never said he could wear it ," he answered .
" Rabbits ," replied Father Brown promptly .
" Rabbits , ribbons , sweetmeats , goldfish , rolls of coloured paper ," said the reverend gentleman with rapidity .
" Well , what in the name of Bedlam do you mean ?"
The conjuring explains the hat .
asked Maggie , staring .
" Well , that ," he said , " that ' s the silliest part of the whole silly story .
As they did so the figure in the corner complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall with a flourish .
Yet he was neither a charlatan nor a child ; but a hot , logical Latin who liked a certain thing and was it .
" In that case ," remarked Muscari , " I confess I prefer the Italian of the past ."
Harrogate has millions in his safes , and I have -- the hole in my pocket .
But you daren ' t say -- you can ' t say -- that he ' s cleverer than I , or bolder than I , or even more energetic .
To be clever enough to get all that money , one must be stupid enough to want it ."
Mr Harrogate , the great financier , did indeed enter the room , but nobody looked at him .
They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril in the mountain path they were to attempt that week .
" A great man ," replied Muscari , " worthy to rank with your own Robin Hood , signorina .
" Now that sort of thing ," observed the banker weightily , " would never be allowed in England ; perhaps , after all , we had better choose another route .
" It can never be utterly stamped out ," Muscari answered ; " because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners .
Our peasants are like their mountains , rich in grace and green gaiety , but with the fires beneath .
" Then you propose to attempt it ?"
asked Mr Harrogate , frowning .
The young Harrogate was left behind for a moment emptying a glass of white wine and lighting a cigarette , as the beauty retired with the banker , the courier and the poet , distributing peals of silvery satire .
The shorter priest turned and walked towards the banker ' s son , and the latter was astonished to realize that though a Roman priest the man was an Englishman .
he asked ; and then , remembering a vague fear of his own , " or can you be thinking of Muscari ?"
" You are rather violent yourself ," and she smiled at him .
" And yet rather fruitless ," he admitted ; " if I die tonight I die unmarried and a fool ."
The first to sit up was the little priest , who scratched his head with a face of foolish wonder .
When he had done so , a most remarkable thing occurred .
Looking around him at the confused and startled group in the hollow , Muscari then perceived that another tanned and tattered man , with a short gun under his arm , was looking at them from the ledge just below , leaning his elbows on the edge of the turf .
" The brigands !"
" This was a trap .
Ezza , if you will oblige me by shooting the coachman first , we can cut our way out yet .
" Then shoot him all the more ," cried the poet impatiently ; " he was bribed to upset his master .
I have been acting epics while you have been writing them ."
" Come on , I tell you !"
" I call myself Montano ," cried the strange courier in a voice equally loud and full .
" This pretty little nest where we are all picnicking ," went on the courier - brigand , with the same easy yet sinister smile , " is , together with some caves underneath it , known by the name of the Paradise of Thieves .
It is something better than impregnable ; it is unnoticeable .
The third item is that of ransom .
I am asking from the friends of the Harrogate family a ransom of three thousand pounds , which I am sure is almost insulting to that family in its moderate estimate of their importance .
I will not conceal from you that the document ends with certain legal phrases about the unpleasant things that may happen if the money is not paid ; but meanwhile , ladies and gentlemen , let me assure you that I am comfortably off here for accommodation , wine and cigars , and bid you for the present a sportsman - like welcome to the luxuries of the Paradise of Thieves ."
All the time that he had been speaking , the dubious - looking men with carbines and dirty slouch hats had been gathering silently in such preponderating numbers that even Muscari was compelled to recognize his sally with the sword as hopeless .
The priest sat down within a yard or two , and Muscari turned his aquiline nose on him in an instantaneous irritation .
" There may be ," said Father Brown agnostically .
persisted his companion .
But I could not help hearing Ezza say these words --` Well , let her have a little fun ; you know the blow may smash her any minute .'
But if it meant this capture in the hills , the thing is nonsense .
" All my riddles , however , revolve round our bandit chief ," resumed the priest reflectively .
Quite the other way , in fact .
" You may think you enlighten me , but you are leading me deeper in the dark .
It is certainly a soft spot to fall on and a sweet spot to look at .
But it is not a fortress .
For it is actually commanded from above by the common high - road across the mountains -- the very place where the police would most probably pass .
The brigands swayed and huddled , cursing and whispering , and the evening air was full of little metallic noises as they cocked their pistols , or loosened their knives , or trailed their scabbards over the stones .
" It is useless ," said the older man , who was trembling violently , " it is useless .
Muscari meanwhile , without waiting for support , had crested the bank up to the road , and struck the brigand king heavily on the shoulder , causing him to stagger and swing round .
" Is your courage a sham as well as your honesty ?"
" I am an actor ; and if I ever had a private character , I have forgotten it .
Darkness was deepening under the mountain walls , and it was not easy to discern much of the progress of the struggle , save that tall men were pushing their horses ' muzzles through a clinging crowd of brigands , who seemed more inclined to harass and hustle the invaders than to kill them .
" Yes ," said the poet quite simply .
" Then go over there and offer yourself ," said the priest : " offer her everything you can ; offer her heaven and earth if you ' ve got them .
They dived into bushes and thick grass like defeated men pursued ; and the great cocked hats of the mounted gendarmerie were seen passing along above the broken hedge .
There was a momentary silence , broken in an extraordinary way by the banker , who cried out in a hoarse and strangled voice : " Robbed !
I ' ve been robbed !"
" Not of two thousand pounds ," said the financier , with an abrupt and terrible composure , " only of a small bottle ."
The great banker nodded with an odd air of business assent , seemed to reflect a moment , and before they could interpose took a half turn and a step that brought him to the edge of the outer mountain wall .
Then , flinging up his hands , he leapt exactly as he leapt out of the coach .
The Duel of Dr Hirsch
M . Brun had a dark wedge of beard apparently affixed under his lower lip .
His house stood in a handsome street near the Elysee -- a street which in that strong summer seemed almost as full of foliage as the park itself ; a row of chestnuts shattered the sunshine , interrupted only in one place where a large cafe ran out into the street .
I cannot come down to speak to you .
He has been kicking the furniture about in all the other rooms ; I have locked myself in my study , opposite that cafe .
I cannot : I will not .
M . Brun borrowed the letter , read it , and looked at M . Armagnac .
Before either could complete a sentence , it was evident that the invader had been expelled from the house opposite .
Betrayed at this moment .
We caught a German spy in the Vosges yesterday , and a paper was found on him -- a paper I hold in my hand .
Oh , they tried to hush it up ; but I took it direct to the man who wrote it -- the man in that house !
P . H .'"
He rattled short sentences like a quick - firing gun , but he was plainly the sort of man who is either mad or right .
The mass of the crowd was Nationalist , and already in threatening uproar ; and a minority of equally angry Intellectuals , led by Armagnac and Brun , only made the majority more militant .
His long bare neck and sloping shoulders were the shape of a champagne bottle , but that was the only festive thing about him .
Two men were instantly found in the crowd itself to offer their services to Colonel Dubosc , who came out presently , satisfied .
He did not lift his eyes from his plate , round which red pepper , lemons , brown bread and butter , etc ., were rigidly ranked , until a tall shadow fell across the table , and his friend Flambeau sat down opposite .
" Wrong ," replied the other , " and wrong exactly where Dr Hirsch would have been right -- about the hiding - place of his own secret formula in his own official department .
" And it is ?"
It says the paper is in the cupboard on the right of the Secretary ' s desk .
Father Brown seemed to cogitate ; he lifted a little whitebait on his fork .
" What the deuce are you frightened of ?"
Treason ?"
" I don ' t know that either ," answered Brown , with a face of blank bewilderment .
No --, what puzzled me was the sincerity of both parties .
I mean the persons of the play .
I mean the men who must have known the truth .
And yet the French statesmen and soldiers went on as if they knew he wasn ' t a wronged man but simply a wrong ' un .
" I wish I did ," said his friend .
But it won ' t wash historically , because Dreyfus ' s document ( if it was his document ) was literally correct ."
In the stillness Flambeau shifted his seat sharply -- making an isolated and echoing noise -- and threw his elbow over the angle of it .
They ' ve been taught that it ' s all a matter of degree ."
" What ' s the matter with you ?"
" Dubosc ' s all right in that way .
You ' d expect , probably a cipher , certainly abbreviations ; most certainly scientific and strictly professional terms .
" I have just come from this Colonel of ours .
snapped Valognes --" some plot of the Jews and Freemasons .
Brown said nothing , but finished his plate of fish .
For one of the shortest , in fact .
It was clear he was already escaping from the hotel .
On the other side of the lane ran the high gilt railings of a gloomy park .
" Do you know ," he said , " there is something about this place that --"
" Dubosc ' s escape is more elaborate than we thought ," he said ; " but I suppose he is escaping from France ."
Why , it ' s the back of the street where old Hirsch lives .
" If God Almighty held the truncheon of the lists , if St Michael blew the trumpet for the swords to cross -- even then , if one of them stood ready , the other would not come ."
" Oh , what does all this mysticism mean ?"
Flambeau ' s first thought was that this really looked like a fight ; but he soon dropped the thought for another .
They don ' t work .
They don ' t fight .
Things made so opposite are things that cannot quarrel .
A few moments later a roar of popular applause from the street beyond announced that Dr Hirsch had once more appeared upon the balcony .
The Man in the Passage
The passage was comparatively long and dark , so each man could see the other as a mere black silhouette at the other end .
Neither was what was commonly called the stage door ; they were a sort of special and private stage doors used by very special performers , and in this case by the star actor and actress in the Shakespearean performance of the day .
As private persons both were handsome , capable and popular .
Fashion could have found no fault with his high silk hat --, yet it was unlike anyone else ' s hat -- a little higher , perhaps , and adding something to his natural height .
His military moustache and the carriage of his shoulders showed him a soldier , but he had a pair of those peculiar frank and piercing blue eyes which are more common in sailors .
You could not get away from hearing of him wherever you were ; his portrait was on every other postcard ; his maps and battles in every other illustrated paper ; songs in his honour in every other music - hall turn or on every other barrel - organ .
Yet he had infinitely less power in England than Sir Wilson Seymour .
She greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile which kept so many males at the same just dangerous distance from her .
For it was against his breeding to show eagerness , and against his conventional unconventionality to give anything so obvious as flowers .
It was made of brass like all the Heroic weapons , but , oddly enough , sharp enough to prick anyone still .
A shrewd person might also have noted a yet odder thing .
The little priest watched , like a Napoleonic campaign , the swift precision of her policy for expelling all while banishing none .
The only way to move him was to appeal to him in confidence as an old friend , to let him into the secret of the clearance .
Then he abandoned himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him -- calculating the angles of the mirrors , the angles of each refraction , the angle at which each must fit into the wall ... when he heard a strong but strangled cry .
At the same instant Sir Wilson Seymour burst back into the room , white as ivory .
And before he could possibly find that weapon or any other , a brisk running of feet broke upon the pavement outside , and the square face of Cutler was thrust into the same doorway .
" What ' s that creature down the passage ?
hissed his pale rival , and made a stride towards him .
In the instant of time in which all this happened Father Brown stepped out into the top of the passage , looked down it , and at once walked briskly towards what he saw .
" Miss Rome sent for me , and I came as quickly as I could .
Her dress was torn away as in a struggle , leaving the right shoulder bare , but the wound from which the blood was welling was on the other side .
The brass dagger lay flat and gleaming a yard or so away .
" You need not kill me ," he said in a voice quite cold ; " I shall do that on my own account ."
And before the others could appreciate his intention he snatched up the dagger , sprang at the other door at the lower end of the passage , burst it open , bolt and all , and confronted Bruno in his dressing - room .
Father Brown instantly ran across to him , taking no notice of Cutler and the colossal actor , though the room already rang with their blows and they began to struggle for the dagger .
Seymour , who retained some practical sense , was whistling for the police at the end of the passage .
" I wish I was him ," he said huskily .
The mind of the little priest was always a rabbit - warren of wild thoughts that jumped too quickly for him to catch them .
They ' ll be sure to subpoena me ; I shall be bound to say that after the cry was heard each of you rushed into the room in a wild state and began quarrelling about a dagger .
All the chief actors being of a worldly importance , the barristers were well balanced ; the prosecutor for the Crown was Sir Walter Cowdray , a heavy , but weighty advocate of the sort that knows how to seem English and trustworthy , and how to be rhetorical with reluctance .
Aurora Rome had been stabbed with some sharp instrument such as a knife or dagger ; some instrument , at least , of which the blade was short .
Sir Wilson Seymour gave evidence as he did everything else that he did at all -- not only well , but perfectly .
Though himself much more of a public man than the judge , he conveyed exactly the fine shade of self - effacement before the King ' s justice ; and though everyone looked at him as they would at the Prime Minister or the Archbishop of Canterbury , they could have said nothing of his part in it but that it was that of a private gentleman , with an accent on the noun .
He was also refreshingly lucid , as he was on the committees .
" Well ," said Sir Walter patiently , " what was the outline like ?
" Not in the least ," answered Seymour quietly .
Sir Wilson was leaving the witness - box , after a few final particulars to which there were many other witnesses , when the counsel for the defence sprang up and stopped him .
" I ' m afraid it is the vulgar test of trousers ," he said .
" So you did think at first it was a woman ?"
The defending counsel also was again brief in his cross - examination ; although ( as was his custom ) even in being brief , he seemed to take a long time about it .
" A woman ' s !"
" And did the figure have any of those serpentine and semi - feminine curves to which eloquent allusion has been made ?
And you say you saw the black shape .
Those in court had been wrought up to an irrational , but real sense of some monstrosity .
They had forgotten the figure in the dock and thought only of the figure in the passage .
And then , without stopping , he shot at Brown the apparently disconnected question : " You have heard about this dagger ; you know the experts say the crime was committed with a short blade ?"
But the judge still looked at him with bright and steady eyes of interest ; and the counsel for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed .
" If Parkinson did it with that pantomime spear ," said Butler , " he must have thrust from four yards away .
" Yes , my lord ; that was what I was trying to say ," said Brown , " but they asked me for the shape ; and our hats have corners just like horns , and so I --"
Father Brown blinked even more painfully than before ; then he stammered : " Really , my lord , I don ' t know unless it ' s because I don ' t look at it so often ."
Blood will have to flow very funnily ; blood will have to flow up the Matterhorn , before I will take it as a sign that I am to shed it ."
He liked Father Brown in a slightly patronizing way ; and Father Brown liked him , though he heartily disliked his theories .
It appeared to be an extract from one of the pinkest of American Society papers , and ran as follows :
" Why , words rather fail me ," answered Father Brown .
Further inquiries showed that one of the cells was empty ; it had been occupied by a rather sullen ruffian giving his name as Oscar Rian .
I doubt whether anybody could find him .
inquired Usher .
he exclaimed .
You know I sometimes take a turn in the country lanes outside this dismal place ; well , I was walking early this evening up a steep lane with dark hedges and grey - looking ploughed fields on both sides ; and a young moon was up and silvering the road .
Then I blew my whistle long and loud , and our fellows came running up to secure him ."
" I had somewhat better grounds ," replied the governor coolly .
" I pass over the first as too simple to be emphasized -- I mean that fashionable athletes do not run across ploughed fields or scratch their eyes out in bramble hedges .
Nor do they run all doubled up like a crouching dog .
His clerical friend asked faintly : " But how ?"
And Greywood Usher threw down the newspapers and took up the two press - cuttings again .
" Yes ; I know that .
" Anyhow ," said Usher , " Last - Trick Todd counts for a great deal in this rum affair ."
Our people aren ' t like the English , who will forgive a man for being rich if he throws away money on hospitals or horses .
Todd might easily get dropped by some man he ' d never even heard of ; some labourer he ' d locked out , or some clerk in a business he ' d busted .
" That ' s how the whole thing looks supposing this Rian made for Pilgrim ' s Pond to kill Todd .
I crouched behind the fence which ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of the great mansion , and which was fortunately split in places , as if specially for the application of a cautious eye .
As she swung it the second time a flicker of its light fell for a moment on her own face , a face that I knew .
I was just turning away when a new noise broke on the night .
There was no mistaking that voice .
" I now ask you to recall that little Society paragraph which seemed to you so painfully lacking in interest .
If the convict was not keeping the shot for Todd , as he evidently wasn ' t , it is most likely that he was keeping it for Lord Falconroy ; and it looks as if he had delivered the goods .
But , as I have pointed out , there are many reasons why people in America might want to kill Todd .
There is no reason why anybody in America should want to kill an English lord newly landed , except for the one reason mentioned in the pink paper -- that the lord is paying his attentions to the millionaire ' s daughter .
This case , sir , will make a noise ."
Thus I wrote ` heron ' and ` eagle ' and ` owl ', and when I wrote ` falcon ' he was tremendously agitated ; and when I began to make an ` r ' at the end of the word , that machine just bounded .
Isn ' t that better evidence than a lot of gabble from witnesses -- if the evidence of a reliable machine ?"
asked the detective .
There was no machine tied on to your pulse ."
He was a handsome , well - bred - looking brute , as he still is , to some extent ; and he used mostly to go about with barmaids or shop - girls and do them out of their money .
Very often , though , he went a good deal farther ; and they were found drugged with cigarettes or chocolates and their whole property missing .
" Why should he be innocent of that crime ?"
Saints alive !
The rest of his face was almost undiscoverable , being masked with a matted beard and whiskers through which the nose could barely thrust itself , and further buried in a squalid red scarf or handkerchief .
Keep him here for a split instant and you ' ll feel pretty mean .
I want --"
yelled Usher , suddenly sitting up straight .
" I think the gentleman ' s name is Todd ," said the priest .
He will be rather impatient to get back to his champagne , from which he ran away in such a hurry , when the convict with the gun hove in sight ."
The priest looked at him very earnestly , but with a baffling and undecipherable face .
Your pink paper says that the title was recently revived for him ; but those papers are very unreliable .
I think you idealize the English aristocracy -- even in assuming it to be so aristocratic .
" Take me to my friend ."
Next morning Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression , carrying yet another piece of pink newspaper .
The paragraph went on : " A laughable occurrence took place outside Wilkinson ' s Motor Garage last night .
A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larrikins to a man in prison dress who was stepping with considerable coolness into the steering - seat of a pretty high - toned Panhard ; he was accompanied by a girl wrapped in a ragged shawl .
She and the gentleman who had donned prison uniform were going for the customary joy - ride ."
It was , in fact , the face of one with the harmless human name of Brown , formerly priest of Cobhole in Essex , and now working in London .
They were sitting at a small table , close up to the window , when the priest pulled the curtain back and looked out .
Then ( seeing his friend put away the pocket - book ), he said softly :
She was simply and even loosely dressed in light brown sacking stuff ; but she was a lady , and even , on a second glance , a rather needlessly haughty one .
" I want you to find out ; I ask it as a favour .
I only want to know the direction ."
" You are a most singular person ," said the young lady .
" Then why did you send him out ?"
After a pause she added : " I had the honour to ask you why you thought the man ' s nose was false ."
observed Brown absent - mindedly .
That is why atheism is only a nightmare ."
I could never describe my father to you ; the nearest I can say is that he was very like a Roman coin himself .
He was prouder of his Collection than of his coat - of - arms -- nobody could say more than that .
He mixed up these Roman halfpence with the honour of the Carstairs family in the same stiff , idolatrous way as his father before him .
" One summer afternoon , when I had promised to go shrimping along the sands with Philip , I was waiting rather impatiently in the front drawing - room , watching Arthur handle some packets of coins he had just purchased and slowly shunt them , one or two at a time , into his own dark study and museum which was at the back of the house .
It seemed to me that if I could only run away with this , and give it to Philip like a wild sort of wedding - ring , it would be a bond between us for ever ; I felt a thousand such things at once .
A Carstairs a thief ; and a thief of the Carstairs treasure !
" Nature is older than the Carstairs Collection .
It was not only the old lion argent that was roaring in my ear , but all the eagles of the Caesars seemed flapping and screaming in pursuit of me .
We were quite alone in a circle of sea - water and wet sand , and I gave him the head of Caesar .
In spite of these he walked straight into the sea without a flash of hesitation , and came on at me with the steadiness of a travelling bullet .
I had stolen the thing suddenly and on impulse ; I was certainly alone ; for I always made sure of being unobserved when I slipped out to see Philip in this way .
He merely said gruffly to the man : ` You clear out of this .'
The door of the tavern opened and the gigantic shadow of the investigator Flambeau fell across the table .
But Flambeau , as he bowed and sat down , handed the priest a small slip of paper .
Thus there was no one to help me in the house , except my brother , whose help must be my ruin .
He turned a corner some six houses down .
But I was too distracted and dreamy to look at the lawns and flower - pots and flower - beds with any concentration .
But when I stared harder , it was more like a man ' s thumb pressed on the pane ; it had that curled look that a thumb has .
" I think I screamed loud and long ; but that doesn ' t matter .
Arthur had gone off suddenly to London , as he so often did , for bargains ; and returned , late but radiant , having nearly secured a treasure that was an added splendour even to the family Collection .
Thus in spite of myself , I fled from my foe almost in the dead of night -- but from Philip also .... My brother was often at the South Kensington Museum , and , in order to make some sort of secondary life for myself , I paid for a few lessons at the Art Schools .
That night the detective and the priest were still talking of the matter as they drew near the Fulham house , a tenement strangely mean even for a temporary residence of the Carstairs family .
You want one person for suicide ; two people for murder ; but at least three people for blackmail "
asked the other .
" Stop him !"
In dead silence Flambeau strode across and telephoned for doctor and police .
" I think ," said Flambeau , " that in spite of everything , they are probably getting on very well ."
He was a stoutish , fair man , in his shirt - sleeves ; his movements were resolute , his mouth firm and his tones final ; but his round , rather babyish blue eyes had a bewildered and even wistful look that rather contradicted all this .
A letter from one of these lay immediately before him , and rapid and resolute as he was , he seemed almost to hesitate before opening it .
The head of the family , you know , is the Duke of Exmoor ; he is one of the few really stiff old Tory aristocrats left , a sound old crusted tyrant it is quite in our line to make trouble about .
And though he had to be loaded with lands and gold and made an ancestor of dukes , the elf - shaped ear is still recurrent in the family .
The reason I point it out to you is this : It seems to me that we make a mistake in attacking aristocracy entirely for its champagne and diamonds .
This elaborate epistle he articulated as if it were all one word ; and Miss Barlow rattled it down as if it were all one word .
Then he took up another strip of proof and a blue pencil , and altered the word " supernatural " to the word " marvellous ", and the expression " shoot down " to the expression " repress ".
The opening was a sound piece of slashing invective about the evil secrets of princes , and despair in the high places of the earth .
Though written violently , it was in excellent English ; but the editor , as usual , had given to somebody else the task of breaking it up into sub - headings , which were of a spicier sort , as " Peeress and Poisons ", and " The Eerie Ear ", " The Eyres in their Eyrie ", and so on through a hundred happy changes .
As for the headlines , the sensational proclamations -- they will come at the end .
I was walking along a public path that threads through a private Devonshire orchard and seems to point towards Devonshire cider , when I came suddenly upon just such a place as the path suggested .
It was even less easy to fix the impression in the case of the man at the right end of the table , who , to say truth , was as commonplace a person as could be seen anywhere , with a round , brown - haired head and a round snub nose , but also clad in clerical black , of a stricter cut .
It was only when I saw his broad curved hat lying on the table beside him that I realized why I connected him with anything ancient .
Perhaps the third man , at the other end of the table , had really more to do with it than the rest , though he was both slighter in physical presence and more inconsiderate in his dress .
The unobtrusive yet unusual colour was all the more notable because his hair was almost unnaturally healthy and curling , and he wore it full .
But , after all analysis , I incline to think that what gave me my first old - fashioned impression was simply a set of tall , old - fashioned wine - glasses , one or two lemons and two churchwarden pipes .
Speaking with restraint and with the accent of a highly educated gentleman , and puffing at intervals at his long churchwarden pipe , he proceeded to tell me some of the most horrible stories I have ever heard in my life : how one of the Eyres in the former ages had hanged his own father ; and another had his wife scourged at the cart tail through the village ; and another had set fire to a church full of children , and so on .
He looked at me a moment , his lips still prim , but whitening and tightening ; then he deliberately broke his long pipe and glass on the table and stood up , the very picture of a perfect gentleman with the framing temper of a fiend .
The curse of the Eyres of old has lain heavy on this country , and many have suffered from it .
I reaffirmed my ignorance , and there was another silence ; then the little priest said , still looking at the table , " That is the Duke of Exmoor ."
The priest shook his head ; and the librarian proceeded to tell the tale as he had heard it from his predecessor in the same post , who had been his patron and instructor , and whom he seemed to trust implicitly .
It left a red triangular scar on the scalp , and the lawyer ' s eyes altered , but not his smile .
" The law will give it you ," he said ; " but you will not take it .... Why not ?
DEAR FINN ,-- Your copy will do , but I have had to headline it a bit ; and our public would never stand a Romanist priest in the story -- you must keep your eye on the suburbs .
I venture to say , without any vanity , that the words I now write will be read all over Europe , and certainly all over America and the Colonies .
I owe it all to the small priest Brown ; he is an extraordinary man .
I don ' t suggest you ' re either more snobbish or more morbid than the rest of us : but don ' t you feel in a vague way that a genuine old family curse is rather a fine thing to have ?
" By Jove !"
" But ," he ended , " he does really conceal his toilet ."
Because it isn ' t the sort of secret we suppose ."
" To see you take off your wig ," said Father Brown .
I could see the librarian ' s great legs wavering under him like the shadows of stems in a pool ; and I could not banish from my own brain the fancy that the trees all around us were filling softly in the silence with devils instead of birds .
" I refuse .
I was leaning over the table in ungovernable excitement ; in listening to this extraordinary duel half a thought had come into my head .
And now let me tell the readers of the Daily Reformer what I think the most remarkable thing in the whole affair .
This transformation scene , which will seem to you as wild and purple as a Persian fairy - tale , has been ( except for my technical assault ) strictly legal and constitutional from its first beginnings .
This man with the odd scar and the ordinary ears is not an impostor .
DEAR FINN ,-- You must be mad ; we can ' t touch this .
Besides , old Soap - Suds was sick enough at not getting his peerage last year ; he ' d sack me by wire if I lost him it with such lunacy as this .
And what about Duffey ?
He ' s doing us some rattling articles on " The Heel of the Norman ."
As Miss Barlow rattled away cheerfully , he crumpled up the copy and tossed it into the waste - paper basket ; but not before he had , automatically and by force of habit , altered the word " God " to the word " circumstances ."
He heard that the coast was death to all but careful seamen ; he also heard that the ship ' s cat was asleep .
He heard Flambeau laugh , and ask if , perhaps , the adventurous title of " Westward Ho !"
Beyond this mere look of things there was little for Brown ' s freshening fancy to feed on ; he saw no human beings , except some gipsies trailing along the river bank , with faggots and osiers cut in the forest ; and one sight no longer unconventional , but in such remote parts still uncommon : a dark - haired lady , bare - headed , and paddling her own canoe .
Some of the planks and beams were of good , seasoned oak ; some of such wood cut raw and recent ; some again of white pinewood , and a great deal more of the same sort of wood painted black with tar .
The next moment a glimpse through the dark trees told him all he wanted to know and he laughed .
" She ' d find a rum sort of thing in the garden ," said Father Brown , " which would not please her Renaissance eye .
" You are really in a land of strange stories .
Well , here ' s the landing stage ; let ' s come ashore and see the old boy ."
The tower , as they left it behind , looked all the quainter , because such entrances are usually flanked by two towers ; and this one looked lopsided .
As he spoke the blade plucked itself out of the crack it had made and came down again with a more ponderous slash , splitting the fissiparous fence to the bottom with a rending noise .
Then a kick of devilish energy sent the whole loosened square of thin wood flying into the pathway , and a great gap of dark coppice gaped in the paling .
Fanshaw peered into the dark opening and uttered an exclamation of astonishment .
" My dear Admiral !"
The voice in the gloom swore again , and then broke into a jolly laugh .
Under the bridge of the hat his eagle face looked eager , all the more because it was not only clean - shaven , but without eyebrows .
When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host he fell again into a tone of rallying the latter about his wreckage of the fence and his apparent rage of profanity .
When I remember how I ' ve cut down a mile and a half of green poisonous jungle with an old cutlass half as sharp as this ; and then remember I must stop here and chop this matchwood , because of some confounded old bargain scribbled in a family Bible , why , I --"
He swung up the heavy steel again ; and this time sundered the wall of wood from top to bottom at one stroke .
Just outside the steps of the porch stood a little painted green garden table , as if someone had just had tea there .
Admiral Pendragon looked very much astonished , though not particularly annoyed ; while Fanshaw was so amused with what looked like a performing pigmy on his little stand , that he could not control his laughter .
He was gazing at three carved symbols , which , though very worn and obscure , seemed still to convey some sense to him .
" Well ," muttered Father Brown , blinking , " here is the legend of the Spaniard plain enough .
Might not that line through the ship be one of those parti - per - pale lines , indented , I think they call it ?
And though the third thing isn ' t so very heraldic , it would be more heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire ; and it looks just as like it ."
" Why , how do you mean ?"
There was another silence in which they heard the continuous murmur of the river ; then Fanshaw said , in a doubtful and perhaps disappointed tone : " Then you don ' t think there is anything in the tales of the tower in flames ?"
Well , a damp dab of mud like this confounded island seems the last place where one would think of fires ."
" What is that fire over there ?"
Almost as he spoke , the butler , a lean man in black , with very black hair and a very long , yellow face , appeared in the doorway and told him that dinner was served .
" I ' m rather sorry you take this so lightly ," said Fanshaw to the host ; " for the truth is , I ' ve brought these friends of mine with the idea of their helping you , as they know a good deal of these things .
Rather to Flambeau ' s surprise , his clerical friend , who seemed to have entirely woken up , took up the digression and talked natural history with his host with a flow of words and much unexpected information , until the dessert and decanters were set down and the last of the servants vanished .
Fanshaw , with his fairy tales , would say my blood moved against men with that black , Spanish - looking hair ."
Flambeau struck the table with his heavy fist .
You won ' t understand , I suppose , unless I tell you the story .
" And your father and brother ," said the priest , very gently , " died at sea , I fear ."
That ' s why I say it will be all right when Walter returns .
You should have seen me with the spud !
" Put down that hose ," he shouted ; " put down that hose and go to your --"
cried Sir Cecil Fanshaw .
Flambeau turned electrified eyes upon his friend , but Fanshaw only said rather absently : " Well , nobody can be killed , anyhow ."
But all this was less to him than the fact that the red rent , which had lately once more increased , had once more slightly diminished .
Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head .
It was echoed by a howl not to be called human , as the being broke from their hold and ran along the garden .
"` Both eyes bright , she ' s all right ; one eye blinks , down she sinks .'"
" I thought of asking this young lady , if it were morning yet , to look through that telescope at the river mouth and the river .
Don ' t let ' s talk about the old Admiral .
Father Brown did not answer ; indeed , he did not speak again , save for civilities , till they were all safe round a cigar - box in the cabin of the yacht .
But his fatigue had fallen on him once more , and he only started once , when Flambeau abruptly told him he had dropped cigar - ash on his trousers .
" That ' s from the fire , but you don ' t think so because you ' re all smoking cigars .
That ' s just the way I got my first faint suspicion about the chart ."
" Do you mean Pendragon ' s chart of his Pacific Islands ?"
Put the same feather with an ink - bottle , a book and a stack of writing - paper , and most men will swear they ' ve seen a quill pen .
But feeling horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things ."
IX .
For miles and miles , forward and back , there was no breathing soul , save two pedestrians , walking at a brisk pace , though one had much longer legs and took much longer strides than the other .
This must be Seawood , I think -- Lord Pooley ' s experiment ; he had the Sicilian Singers down at Christmas , and there ' s talk about holding one of the great glove - fights here .
Slight as was the difference of height , it gave in those level wastes a sense of seeing yet farther and farther across land and sea .
But the little priest was looking rather curiously at the corners and edges of the wood alleged to be rotten , and there was a sort of trouble on his brow .
The priest was holding a splinter of the broken wood between his finger and thumb , and did not immediately reply .
There came a scurrying noise behind him , and the little priest came scrambling out of the hole faster than he had fallen in .
His face was no longer disconcerted , but rather resolute , and , perhaps only through the reflections of the snow , a trifle paler than usual .
" Have you found the god of the temple ?"
" What the devil do you mean ?"
Following his finger , Flambeau saw for the first time the corners of a building nearer than the farmhouse , but screened for the most part with a fringe of trees .
" Much obliged ," said Flambeau .
" I didn ' t mean --" began Father Brown .
It thundered some foreign name loudly but inaudibly , and the hotel proprietor moved more sharply towards it than he had done for Flambeau ' s sherry .
" Or on the seat ," said Flambeau , and pointed to the little table .
" What was he like ?"
He also was black , and yet his glossy skin flung back the light at eight angles or more .
It is needless to say that he wore white spats and a white slip inside his waistcoat .
Flambeau felt quite certain that one of his eyes was naturally larger than the other .
It was the shock of that shadow , before the shock of the iron crash , that made the stranger quail and dodge , and then dart into his inn , leaving the flat and shining dagger he had dropped exactly where it had fallen .
As he spoke a black feather from one of the ornamental firs fell , brushing the brim of his hat .
I acted on impulse .
But I fear this business has deep roots and dark ."
A bird sailed in heaven over it .
" Not so sure he was murdered ?"
Do you feel sure a wise murderer would always want the spot to be lonely ?
he cried .
Now they ' re fighting with the regulation gloves , and there ' s not the rag of a possibility of either of the boxers being killed ."
" I didn ' t mean either of the boxers ," said the little priest .
" Who ' s going to be killed ?
As it is , I must ask you to announce that the fight is off for the present ."
" And took here ," resumed Pooley in his restless way , " it ' s worse than that .
I picked it up on a bookstall in London -- very cheap , too ."
It differs from most other forms of devil - worship and human sacrifice in the fact that the blood is not shed formally on the altar , but by a sort of assassination among the crowd .
But after --'"
The more a man feels lonely the less he can be sure he is alone .
Didn ' t you know when he ' s killed a crab , and wouldn ' t you have known if it had been a creditor ?
Anybody might have seen it done while the stand stood empty -- any tramp under the hedges or motorist among the hills .
Nigger Ned had been overtaken a mile or two away , and murdered three policemen with his closed left hand .
" I think ," said Father Brown , " he would blacken his face ."
Flambeau , leaning motionless on the parapet , laughed and said : " My dear fellow !"
The Salad of Colonel Cray
There was also a man of reflection , who was much simpler but much stronger , who could not easily be stopped ; whose thought was always ( in the only intelligent sense of the words ) free thought .
Half - way down one side of the house stood out a projection like a very low shed ; it was , as he afterwards discovered , a large dustbin .
The Major looked at him rather queerly with his good - humoured gooseberry eyes .
" I have heard of him , of course ," said the priest innocently .
" Did you -- did you hit anything ?"
He knew now what it was that was neither soda - water nor the snorting of a dog .
" Well ," ejaculated the staring Major , " I never heard before that a service revolver was a thing to be sneezed at ."
It was common enough , at that time of the morning , to find the remains of a banquet over - night ; but to find it freshly spread so early was unusual .
At last he spoke , spluttering : " All the silver gone !"
" Fish - knives and forks gone .
" They ' re simply a blind ," said Cray stubbornly .
" A burglar with a bad cold ," observed Father Brown , " that might assist you to trace him in the neighbourhood ."
Then , as the restless man with the revolver turned again towards the door in the garden , he added in a husky , confidential voice : " I doubt whether I should send for the police , for fear my friend here has been a little too free with his bullets , and got on the wrong side of the law .
He ' s lived in very wild places ; and , to be frank with you , I think he sometimes fancies things ."
While the Major strolled unobtrusively towards him , the priest took an equally indolent turn , which took him round the next corner of the house to within a yard or two of the projecting dustbin .
The cook might well be careworn , for cookery was the Major ' s hobby .
The only other person he even admitted to be a judge of an omelette was his friend Cray -- and as Brown remembered this , he turned to look for the other officer .
I don ' t believe you men can manage alone ."
" Oh yes , we can , my dear ," said the Major , looking at her very amiably .
For indeed the little domestic difficulty of which she was now speaking so decisively was rather comic than tragic .
They never strive against it .
" You want to be proved wrong ," said Brown .
She ' s been at me ," and he tossed his tousled black head towards Audrey , but the other had no need of the direction , " she ' s been at me today about how cruel I was to shoot a poor harmless house - breaker , and how I have the devil in me against poor harmless natives .
Curious things .
The last day we were in an Indian city I asked Putnam if I could get some Trichinopoli cigars , he directed me to a little place opposite his lodgings .
I had begun , in the dim light , to guess at the hieroglyphic , not without horror , when a more horrible thing happened .
" When he said the words I heard the elaborate iron latch with which I had struggled , automatically unlock itself : and then , far down the dark passages I had passed , I heard the heavy street - door shifting its own bolts backwards .
Well , I ' ll simply tell you , in the fewest words , the three things that have happened since ; and you shall judge which of us is right .
I woke in black midnight , and lay thinking of nothing in particular , when I felt a faint tickling thing , like a thread or a hair , trailed across my throat .
It was a jumble of tavern and curiosity - shop ; and though there was nothing there remotely suggesting the cult of the Monkey , it is , of course , possible that some of its images or talismans were in such a place .
We were in a fortress there ; and as it happened our bedrooms overlooked the open sea , which almost came up to our window - sills , save for a flat white outer wall as bare as the sea .
I woke up again ; but it was not dark .
It flew straight in at my window and smashed the lamp beside the pillow I had just quitted .
As they entered they passed Miss Watson buttoning her gloves for church , and heard the voice of Putnam downstairs still giving a lecture on cookery to the cook .
" This is more so , I know ," he said , laying his hand on the big book he had dropped , " a dictionary of drugs and such things .
Cray slipped upstairs to change ; Dr Oman and Miss Watson betook themselves solemnly down the street , with a string of other churchgoers ; but Father Brown noticed that the doctor twice looked back and scrutinized the house ; and even came back to the corner of the street to look at it again .
He was the more puzzling because he did not seem to want any lunch .
You ' ve got a lettuce there ."
" I know ," replied Brown , rather vaguely .
I ' m so fond of salads ."
And to the amazement of the two men he took a pepper - pot out of his waistcoat pocket and put it on the table .
As for oil , which I think I put in my left --"
Before he could quite recover himself Cray had cloven in .
Major Putnam had sprung up , his purple face mottled .
He could not hear what they said to each other ; but their faces moved with amazement , not unhappiness .
" I suppose the Major was in love with her , too ," he said with a sigh ; and when the other nodded , observed : " You were very generous , doctor .
For while the journalism of the States permits a pantomimic vulgarity long past anything English , it also shows a real excitement about the most earnest mental problems , of which English papers are innocent , or rather incapable .
That fated philosopher had consented , in a somewhat dazed manner , to receive the interviewer , and had named the hour of nine that evening .
The whisky , of course , was the choice brand of The Champion Arms ; the cigar he had probably brought with him from London .
Nothing could be more different than his cynical negligence from the dapper dryness of the young American ; but something in his pencil and open notebook , and perhaps in the expression of his alert blue eye , caused Kidd to guess , correctly , that he was a brother journalist .
Sir Claude Champion was known to the readers of the Western Sun as well as Mr Boulnois .
There was in him none of that antiquarian frivolity that we convey by the word " dilettante ".
But though Kidd knew a great deal about Sir Claude -- a great deal more , in fact , than there was to know -- it would never have crossed his wildest dreams to connect so showy an aristocrat with the newly - unearthed founder of Catastrophism , or to guess that Sir Claude Champion and John Boulnois could be intimate friends .
Indeed , Boulnois ' s cottage stood just outside the gates of Pendragon Park .
But I don ' t believe it ' s possible ."
" Yes ," answered Dalroy ; " but even a man of grand intellectual powers can ' t be such a blighted fool as all that .
Must you be going on ?
" Did he go with Mrs -- with the rest of the party ?"
But as he went on he was more and more inclined to conclude , with the remains of his reason , that there really were other feet upon the road .
That white face flung up to heaven , clean - shaven and so unnaturally young , like Byron with a Roman nose , those black curls already grizzled -- he had seen the thousand public portraits of Sir Claude Champion .
The wild red figure reeled an instant against the sundial ; the next it had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American ' s feet , faintly moving one arm .
" All these Champions are papists ."
" Just before the police come ," he said apologetically , " has anyone got a light ?"
Then , without glancing at the point or pommel , he handed the long weapon to the doctor .
But the little priest only walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine , and at last stopped dead , on the steps of the house .
" My husband is at home ," she said .
she said , with a rather fearful smile .
Will you tell me why you haven ' t jumped to the conclusion of poor John ' s guilt , as all the rest have done ?
At least , at most enemies .
At all enemies except one ."
Did Sir Claude kill himself ?"
" Because my husband wouldn ' t hate him ."
Father Brown only nodded , and seemed still to be listening ; he differed from most detectives in fact and fiction in a small point -- he never pretended not to understand when he understood perfectly well .
My husband has never been celebrated or successful ; and it is the solemn truth that he has never dreamed of being so .
He thinks no more about such things than -- than an absent - minded lion .
Nobody could have explained to my husband .
The monomaniac suddenly saw despair .
" All the servants were out of the house , seeing the theatricals .
he cried seeming galvanized into sudden life .
A decanter of port and a wineglass were at his elbow ; and the instant the priest entered he noted the long ash stand out unbroken on his cigar .
Boulnois looked at him steadily , but a red bar began to show across his broad brow ; and he seemed like one discovering embarrassment for the first time .
The Fairy Tale of Father Brown
Amid the brisk , bright colours of such a day , and in the heraldic framework of such a town , he did feel rather as if he had entered a fairy tale .
It was one of the great police mysteries about twenty years ago .
They tell me that not long ago he could still be seen about the neighbourhood occasionally , a man in a black cloak , nearly blind , with very wild , white hair , but a face of astonishing softness ."
He lived almost entirely in a little room that was in the very centre of the enormous labyrinth of all the other rooms , and even in this he erected another sort of central cabin or cupboard , lined with steel , like a safe or a battleship .
On the other hand , if you showed an Ancient Briton a revolver , I doubt if he would know it was a weapon -- until it was fired into him , of course .
According to Grimm , what happened was this ."
He paused a moment to drain the greater part of his dark lager at a draught , and then resumed :
" Otto , Prince of Heiligwaldenstein and Grossenmark , was lying in the dews of the darkening twilight in the woods beyond the castle , with his arms flung out and his face flung up to the moon .
asked the priest , staring rather vacantly at the veil of the branches above him .
asked Father Brown .
" I know what you ' re driving at ," said Flambeau rather gloomily .
All the same , however romantic you are , you can ' t imagine a big bullet into a man ' s jaw or brain without using a gun or pistol .
I leave it to you , my friend ."
asked the little priest .
" There was only one in his head ," said his companion , " but there was another bullet - hole in the sash ."
" I don ' t think I remember ," he said .
Let me think this out for a moment ."
asked the priest at last .
But to think of hate so patient --"
" I suppose ," said Flambeau , " that you ' ve got some notion in your head , but it won ' t easily get the bullet out of his .
As I explained before , he might easily have been strangled .
" His great passion was not the much nobler dread of death , but the strange desire of gold .
He had known its place for years , and made no effort to find it , even before his new ascetic creed had cut him off from property or pleasures .
Since he was certain there were no private arms in the whole principality , he was a hundred times more certain there were none in the Quaker ' s little hermitage on the hill , where he lived on herbs , with two old rustic servants , and with no other voice of man for year after year .
Prince Otto looked down with something of a grim smile at the bright , square labyrinths of the lamp - lit city below him .
` He has spoken of things not lawful .
" Otto had the vice of his Prussian type and tradition , which is to regard success not as an incident but as a quality .
He conceived himself and his like as perpetually conquering peoples who were perpetually being conquered .
Consequently , he was ill acquainted with the emotion of surprise , and ill prepared for the next movement , which startled and stiffened him .
His legs were free to leap like an antelope on the mountains , his arms were free to use any gesture or wave any signal , but he could not speak .
" He had come close to the woods that walled in the castle before he had quite realized what his wordless state meant and was meant to mean .
Once more he looked down grimly at the bright , square labyrinths of the lamp - lit city below him , and he smiled no more .
He stooped to pick a flower , as if it were a charm against enchantment .
May God have mercy on his soul .
But I incline to believe that there was a fairy tale , after all , in that little wood , horrible as was its occasion .
She persuaded the sentry to go back to his post , in which place there was nothing to connect him with the disaster ; he was but one of the most loyal and orderly of fifty such sentries within call .
Weak if we were and foolish , not thus we failed , not thus ; When that black Baal blocked the heavens he had no hymns from us Children we were -- our forts of sand were even as weak as eve , High as they went we piled them up to break that bitter sea .
God and the good Republic come riding back in arms : We have seen the City of Mansoul , even as it rocked , relieved -- Blessed are they who did not see , but being blind , believed .
This is a tale of those old fears , even of those emptied hells , And none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells -- Of what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crash , Of what huge devils hid the stars , yet fell at a pistol flash .
G . K . C .
THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London , as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset .
It had been the outburst of a speculative builder , faintly tinged with art , who called its architecture sometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne , apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical .
That scientific gentleman with the bald , egg - like head and the bare , bird - like neck had no real right to the airs of science that he assumed .
More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall , when the extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a drifting cloud .
The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place .
He put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure .
The very empyrean seemed to be a secret .
So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he had that moment fallen out of that impossible sky .
The third party of the group , Gregory ' s sister Rosamond , who had her brother ' s braids of red hair , but a kindlier face underneath them , laughed with such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave commonly to the family oracle .
Gregory resumed in high oratorical good humour .
" You might transpose the words anywhere .
It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach .
Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ?
But man is a magician , and his whole magic is in this , that he does say Victoria , and lo !
No , take your books of mere poetry and prose ; let me read a time table , with tears of pride .
Take your Byron , who commemorates the defeats of man ; give me Bradshaw , who commemorates his victories .
We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria .
Yes , the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven .
" Really ," said Gregory superciliously , " the examples you choose --"
" I beg your pardon ," said Syme grimly , " I forgot we had abolished all conventions ."
he asked .
asked the girl , with grave eyes .
No .
She was looking at him from under level brows ; her face was grave and open , and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that unreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most frivolous woman , the maternal watch which is as old as the world .
Everyone had gone long ago , and he went himself with a rather hurried apology .
In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no part at all ; he never saw her again until all his tale was over .
When Syme went out into the starlit street , he found it for the moment empty .
Directly outside the door stood a street lamp , whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree that bent out over the fence behind him .
He made a sort of doubtful salute , which Syme somewhat more formally returned .
" Might I have a moment ' s conversation ?"
Then after a pause he said , " But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument ?"
" No ," cried out Gregory , in a voice that rang down the street , " I did not stand here to resume our argument , but to end it for ever ."
The silence fell again , and Syme , though he understood nothing , listened instinctively for something serious .
If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out .
I am going , at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour , to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said ."
" In what I said ?"
" Serious !"
is this street serious ?
Is the whole caboodle serious ?
" You spoke just now of having a religion .
" Oh ," said Syme with a beaming smile , " we are all Catholics now ."
" Your offer ," he said , " is far too idiotic to be declined .
" I think ," said Gregory , with placid irrelevancy , " that we will call a cab ."
He gave two long whistles , and a hansom came rattling down the road .
The two got into it in silence .
THE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop , into which Gregory rapidly conducted his companion .
The room was so small and dark , that very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned , beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded .
asked Gregory politely .
To his indescribable astonishment , the man only said " Certainly , sir !"
" I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself ; I have dined .
" I don ' t often have the luck to have a dream like this .
Ah , here comes your champagne !
We are the most modest men that ever lived on earth ."
" If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little , don ' t put it down to your inroads into the champagne .
It is not a little to his credit that he performed these rites with so much composure , for almost before he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to revolve , first slowly , and then rapidly , as if at an insane seance .
" Quite so ," said Syme placidly , " a kind of screw .
Gregory led him down a low , vaulted passage , at the end of which was the red light .
They passed through several such passages , and came out at last into a queer steel chamber with curved walls , almost spherical in shape , but presenting , with its tiers of benches , something of the appearance of a scientific lecture - theatre .
Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow , and , to do you justice , you are still .
Does this place strike you as being serious ?"
" It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety ," assented Syme ; " but may I ask you two questions ?
You need not fear to give me information , because , as you remember , you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police , a promise I shall certainly keep .
First of all , what is it really all about ?
" The history of the thing might amuse you ," he said .
down !
Well , well , it seems majors don ' t do this .
asked Syme .
I said to him , ' What disguise will hide me from the world ?
' You want a safe disguise , do you ?
You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless ; a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb ?'
' Why , then , dress up as an anarchist , you fool !'
" I feel that I can confide anything to you , as you have promised to tell nobody .
We shall , of course , go through a form of election ; but I don ' t mind telling you that it is practically certain what the result will be ."
" It is almost a settled thing that I am to be Thursday ."
said Syme heartily , " I congratulate you .
" Well , damn it all !
Gregory , I gave you a promise before I came into this place .
" Yes ," said Syme , " I have a secret ."
Gregory glared at him gravely for a few moments , and then said abruptly --
Yes , I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me .
Syme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long , white hands into his long , grey trousers ' pockets .
Gregory tried to spring up straight , but he swayed thrice .
But I think I hear your friends coming ."
Syme did not flinch , but he put up a pale and polite hand .
Don ' t you see that we ' re both in the same boat ?
" I can ' t tell the police you are an anarchist .
You are not surrounded by inquisitive policemen ; I am surrounded by inquisitive anarchists .
Come , come !
" Comrade Gregory ," he said , " I suppose this man is a delegate ?"
Gregory , taken by surprise , looked down and muttered the name of Syme ; but Syme replied almost pertly --
The brow of the little man with the black beard was , however , still contracted with something like suspicion .
I have been specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of Sunday ."
The little man dropped one of his papers , and a flicker of fear went over all the faces of the group .
When Gregory heard the dangerous dialogue end , with a sudden safety for his rival , he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful thought .
Little was to be hoped from them .
He strode across to the group of anarchists , which was already distributing itself along the benches .
A little man with a velvet coat and pointed beard seconded .
" Before I put the matter to the vote ," said the chairman , " I will call on Comrade Gregory to make a statement ."
Gregory rose amid a great rumble of applause .
His face was deadly pale , so that by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet .
He had made up his mind , and he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white road .
He believed in his own literary power , his capacity for suggesting fine shades and picking perfect words .
Could he not now , in the hour of peril , make Syme think so again ?
Our belief has been slandered , it has been disfigured , it has been utterly confused and concealed , but it has never been altered .
We have no chance of denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of Europe to another .
Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians .
We are modest , as they were modest -- look at me .
" No , no !"
" I say we are merciful ," repeated Gregory furiously , " as the early Christians were merciful .
" Why not ?"
said Witherspoon , " down with love ."
" Does anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory ?"
But as the chairman was opening his mouth to put it , Syme sprang to his feet and said in a small and quiet voice --
Mr . Gabriel Syme evidently understood oratory .
Having said these first formal words in a moderated tone and with a brief simplicity , he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as if one of the guns had gone off .
Do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us , ' Be good , and you will be happy ,' ' Honesty is the best policy ,' and ' Virtue is its own reward '?
" Comrade Gregory has told us , in only too apologetic a tone , that we are not the enemies of society .
There I agree .
" Comrade Gregory accuses me of hypocrisy .
I set myself against Comrade Gregory as impersonally and as calmly as I should choose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the wall ; and I say that rather than have Gregory and his milk - and - water methods on the Supreme Council , I would offer myself for election --"
" I do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us murderers ; I go to earn it ( loud and prolonged cheering ).
he said .
" Yes ," said Syme , quite motionless , " what is he ?"
said Mr . Witherspoon .
" Who are you ?
You are not Sunday "; and another anarchist added in a heavier voice , " And you are not Thursday ."
" Comrades ," cried Gregory , in a voice like that of a martyr who in an ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain , " it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave .
I implore you .
Do not elect this man ."
The instant the election was ended and irrevocable , and Syme had received the paper proving his election , they all sprang to their feet , and the fiery groups moved and mixed in the room .
Syme found himself , somehow or other , face to face with Gregory , who still regarded him with a stare of stunned hatred .
CHAPTER IV
Nor was his hatred of anarchy hypocritical .
He had not attained it by any tame tradition .
But he seemed to be getting no nearer his enemy , and , what was worse , no nearer a living .
Indeed , he always felt that Government stood alone and desperate , with its back to the wall .
Syme , at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity , seemed stung by the mere stolidity of the automatic official , a mere bulk of blue in the twilight .
Look at that bloody red sun and that bloody river !
said Syme , staring .
" Good God , the Board Schools !"
The Board Schools came after my time .
What education I had was very rough and old - fashioned , I am afraid ."
He is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family and the State .
It is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy , not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense .
" The work of the philosophical policeman ," replied the man in blue , " is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective .
The ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed .
We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal .
Syme struck his hands together .
" I have felt it from my boyhood , but never could state the verbal antithesis .
But the evil philosopher is not trying to alter things , but to annihilate them .
The moderns say we must not punish heretics .
" It is a chance not to be missed , certainly ," assented Syme , " but still I do not quite understand .
I know as well as anybody that the modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little movements .
" Do not confuse it ," replied the constable , " with those chance dynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland , which are really the outbreaks of oppressed , if mistaken , men .
The outer ring -- the main mass of their supporters -- are merely anarchists ; that is , men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness .
They believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good .
You should really come and see him .
" No ," said the policeman placidly , " he has a fancy for always sitting in a pitch - dark room .
It was not the ordinary darkness , in which forms can be faintly traced ; it was like going suddenly stone - blind .
" You are willing , that is enough ," said the unknown .
" Well , really ," said Syme , " I don ' t know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test ."
Where his adventure ultimately led him we have already seen .
It gave , not the sense of bright moonshine , but rather of a dead daylight .
The clear moon that had lit up Chiswick had gone down by the time that they passed Battersea , and when they came under the enormous bulk of Westminster day had already begun to break .
AT first the large stone stair seemed to Syme as deserted as a pyramid ; but before he reached the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and looking out across the river .
As Syme drew nearer to him step by step , he did not even move a hair ; and Syme could come close enough to notice even in the dim , pale morning light that his face was long , pale and intellectual , and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin , all else being clean - shaven .
He was as motionless as a wax - work , and got on the nerves somewhat in the same way .
And there was the last nightmare touch that his smile suddenly went wrong .
He spoke without further explanation or inquiry , like a man speaking to an old colleague .
It seemed almost as if all friendly words were to him lifeless conveniences , and that his only life was hate .
So in case you don ' t know , I ' d better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now .
Originally , of course , we met in a cell underground , just as your branch does .
asked Syme .
" It ' s quite simple what they say ," answered his guide .
It will never be known , I suppose , why this square itself should look so alien and in some ways so continental .
His vastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite incredibly fat .
The ears that stood out from it looked larger than human ears .
They do say they will throw bombs at ze king ."
Syme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled and broke the balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe .
And this sense became overpowering as he drew nearer to the great President .
The men greeted him with good - humoured raillery as if they had always known him .
He sobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and solid , shining coffee - pot ; then he looked again at Sunday .
The man ' s name , it seemed , was Gogol ; he was a Pole , and in this circle of days he was called Tuesday .
He dresses up like a gentleman , but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one .
" You hide as much as anybody ; but you can ' t do it , you see , you ' re such an ass !
" I am not good at deception ," said Tuesday gloomily , flushing .
" Right , my boy , right ," said the President with a ponderous heartiness , " you aren ' t good at anything ."
He had thought at first that they were all of common stature and costume , with the evident exception of the hairy Gogol .
It was no physical ill that troubled him .
He was a short , square man with a dark , square face clean - shaven , a medical practitioner going by the name of Bull .
He carried his fine clothes with confidence rather than ease , and he mostly wore a set smile .
Partly from this , and partly because he had a vulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to Syme that he might be the wickedest of all those wicked men .
THE EXPOSURE
SUCH were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world .
Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were subjective , that he was only looking at ordinary men , one of whom was old , another nervous , another short - sighted .
He knew that each one of these men stood at the extreme end , so to speak , of some wild road of reasoning .
He looked over the edge of the balcony , and saw a policeman , standing abstractedly just beneath , staring at the bright railings and the sunlit trees .
He had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to that policeman .
In all the torrent of his thought there were two thoughts that never crossed his mind .
Many moderns , inured to a weak worship of intellect and force , might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality .
The men were eating as they talked , and even in this they were typical .
It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Christians .
It expands ; it only destroys because it broadens ; even so , thought only destroys because it broadens .
The old Professor was staring at the ceiling with dull eyes .
There was a singular silence , and then the Secretary said --
Syme stood up taut , as if it had been a bugle before the battle .
All was swallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the President was wrong and that the barrel - organ was right .
which in the old nasal French has the clang and groan of great iron .
" You zay you nod ' ide .
You zay you show himselves .
As for him , he had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the intention , at any rate , of making a good speech .
I have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs ( long inured to our levities ) might hear some new seriousness in my voice .
Comrades , we were discussing plans and naming places .
They all moved feverishly in their seats , except Syme .
" SIT down !"
For although the card lay at the other extreme of the table , and he could read nothing of the inscription on it , it bore a startling resemblance to the blue card in his own pocket , the card which had been given to him when he joined the anti - anarchist constabulary .
" I gather that you fully understand your position ," said Sunday .
All I say is , I don ' t believe any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did his ."
" I concede the point ," said Sunday .
" I believe your own accent to be inimitable , though I shall practise it in my bath .
I must be off .
" I must protest , President , that the thing is irregular ," he said .
The Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger .
" I really fail to understand --" he began in high offense .
On the contrary , he rather congratulated himself that the Professor ' s stroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind .
He strolled away through the dancing snow , turned up two or three streets , down through two or three others , and entered a small Soho restaurant for lunch .
Surely Sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man ? "
Yet he rambled and dodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare .
When he did so , he struck it much farther up than he had fancied .
Under the white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very queer kind of green twilight , as of men under the sea .
Concealment was impossible now ; and looking back over his shoulder , he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long , swinging strides like a man winning a mile race .
It was a foul tavern , sprinkled with foreign sailors , a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn .
Perhaps the foolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal that he ought to have understood .
" Whatever made you think of a policeman in connection with me ?"
" The process was simple enough ," answered the Professor patiently .
Why must I be a policeman ?
In an evolutionary sense , sir , the ape fades so gradually into the policeman , that I myself can never detect the shade .
The monkey is only the policeman that may be .
" No !"
" Because you are what ?"
asked one wondering labourer from the docks .
" At myself ," answered Syme , and went off again into the agony of his ecstatic reaction .
Do you think I ' d look at the beastly stuff when I ' m out of sight of the bloody anarchists ?
yes , I ' ll finish it right enough !"
" Yes ," answered the other dispassionately .
" I am subject to colds ."
He laughed at the idea of the paralytic Professor being really a young actor dressed up as if for the foot - lights .
The false Professor drank and wiped his false beard .
" I ?
" But didn ' t you ?"
The face of Professor de Worms darkened , and he did not look up .
" Professor ," he cried , " it is intolerable .
Then he rose to his feet erect , like an insulted man , and thrust the chair away from him .
I am afraid of him .
" Because I am afraid of him ," said Syme ; " and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid ."
Who would stoop to be fearless -- like a tree ?
So I say to you , strike upwards , if you strike at the stars ."
" Have you any conception how ?"
" Confound it !"
" And we don ' t know where he is ."
" I will take you there ," said the Professor , and took down his own hat from a peg .
he asked sharply .
" Will you join me ?
He is hygienic , and retires early ."
" As a matter of fact he lives some way off , on the other side of the river , but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed ."
Their special poise and position made one block of buildings especially look like a Tower of Babel with a hundred eyes .
Even as he stared , the highest light in this innumerably lighted turret abruptly went out , as if this black Argus had winked at him with one of his innumerable eyes .
" What do you mean ?"
His own story was almost as silly as Syme ' s .
But , indeed , to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression .
" I am a portrait of the celebrated Professor de Worms , who is , I believe , in Naples ."
I did not gather much about him beyond his appearance , which was very disgusting , and which I studied carefully .
When I met him I was in a frivolous mood , and I disliked him so much that I resolved to imitate him .
They thought I really was the great Nihilist Professor .
The policeman impassively consulted a paper in his hand , ' No , sir ,' he said civilly , ' at least , not exactly , sir .
CHAPTER IX
THE MAN IN SPECTACLES
" You don ' t look as if it were ," said Syme ; " you drink it as if it were medicine ."
Inside I am really bursting with boyish merriment ; but I acted the paralytic Professor so well , that now I can ' t leave off .
Then , as the other did not speak , he added --
" Thank you ," said Syme , " you flatter me ."
We are trying to steal a secret from a very sharp , very strong , and very wicked man .
He has not perhaps the white - hot enthusiasm unto death , the mad martyrdom for anarchy , which marks the Secretary .
But then that very fanaticism in the Secretary has a human pathos , and is almost a redeeming trait .
Depend on it , Sunday was not asleep ( I wonder if he ever sleeps ?)
Syme , if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive , we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see .
My favourite word is ' coeval '.
" Do stop playing the goat ," said the Professor plaintively .
" You don ' t know how serious this is ."
We might say , ' Dr .
It seemed to him in some curious way that all the safety and sociability of the night before fell with the bedclothes off him , and he stood up in an air of cold danger .
The Professor made no answer , but gazed in front of him with eyes the colour of a wintry sea ; so Syme repeated his question .
His first thought was that the Professor had gone mad , but his second thought was more frightful .
He almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside .
Let ' s get out to breakfast ."
They took their hats and sticks in silence ; but as Syme took his sword - stick , he held it hard .
They reached the bottom of the huge block of buildings which they had seen from across the river , and began in silence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps , only pausing now and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters .
Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about the distance of the fixed stars .
Dr . Bull was in his white shirt and black breeches only ; his cropped , dark head might well have just come out of its wig ; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre .
The strong , white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp shadows , made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had looked at the breakfast on the balcony .
He looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in , and rose with the resilient rapidity of which the Professor had spoken .
Dr . Bull smiled again , but continued to gaze on them without speaking .
Syme remembered those wild woes of yesterday as one remembers being afraid of Bogy in childhood .
The whole had a sense of unbearable reality .
Syme plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation which always came to him when he was alarmed .
So unless you or I can get on his track --"
The other answered , " Extraordinary rot !"
" Dr .
Syme sprang to his feet , stepping backwards a little , like a chemical lecturer from a successful explosion .
And indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene .
The smile was still there , but it might have been the first smile of a baby .
" I knew my intuition was as infallible as the Pope .
roared Syme , beside himself .
Look at his face , look at his collar , look at his blessed boots !
cried the other in an apprehensive agony .
The Professor was descending the stairs , but his voice came up from below .
" I ' ve been half dead with the jumps , being quite alone .
But the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles ."
But for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter ; and they all swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter .
They said my very walk was respectable , and that seen from behind I looked like the British Constitution .
One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile ; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like a negro anarchist ; but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark .
Syme ' s eyes suddenly flashed on him .
" How was that ?"
" It is indeed a new idea ," said the Professor .
Their new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind .
They were already on the Calais boat before conversation flowed freely .
It was perfectly choking .
Whenever I tried to slip out of it I saw the President somewhere , smiling out of the bow - window of a club , or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus .
Shall we be in time to catch him ?"
" Yes ," answered the new guide , " I ' ve timed it all .
He reflected a little , and then said --
" I tried to tell the police and I couldn ' t , because of some silly oath I took .
My friends , that man is the most utterly unhappy man that was ever human .
said Dr . Bull .
I have turned over twenty schemes in my head .
We cannot denounce him as a dynamiter ; that is agreed .
I am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves in the best society ."
" He ' s gone off his head ," said the little Doctor , staring .
The Professor seized Syme roughly by the waistcoat .
Syme , who had now taken the lead as Bull had taken it in London , led them along a kind of marine parade until he came to some cafes , embowered in a bulk of greenery and overlooking the sea .
SYME sat down at a cafe table with his companions , his blue eyes sparkling like the bright sea below , and ordered a bottle of Saumur with a pleased impatience .
It was arranged like a printed catechism , with questions and answers , and was delivered with an extraordinary rapidity of utterance .
" Do let me read it you .
asked Dr . Bull in exasperation .
" Why , how true that is ," he said , " and I never thought of it .
" Oh , you ' re as drunk as an owl !"
He looked across to the little table where the Marquis sat .
Indeed , one might say that he looked the king , with his animal elegance , his scornful eyes , and his proud head lifted against the purple sea .
Just so , Syme thought , would the brown - gold face of such a tyrant have shown against the dark green olives and the burning blue .
" Are you going to address the meeting ?"
The Marquis , seeing him , arched his black Assyrian eyebrows in surprise , but smiled politely .
said Syme , with gestures of explanation .
cried the gentleman with the red rosette , " when ?"
" I said nothing at all ," said the Marquis , " except something about the band .
We are always being insulted about it ."
said the second gentleman .
" It seems to me ," said the other , " that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the Marquis ."
Syme bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness .
For now that he came back to them he was quite sober , a little pale , and he spoke in a low voice of passionate practicality .
But look here , and listen carefully .
There is no time for talk .
Then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings .
You understand ?
Syme was subject to spasms of singular common sense , not otherwise a part of his character .
They were ( as he said of his impulse about the spectacles ) poetic intuitions , and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy .
He induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not far from the railway , and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement .
But it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his train , not only his seconds carrying the sword - case , but two of his servants carrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket .
On his right was a little wood ; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line , which he was , so to speak , guarding from the Marquis , whose goal and escape it was .
Dr . Bull , however , having been carefully coached by Syme upon this point of policy , insisted , with great dignity and in very bad French , that it should continue until one of the combatants was disabled .
" To a man of the well - known skill and valour of Monsieur de St . Eustache ," said the Professor solemnly , " it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted , and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter , reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit , but for the just and honourable nature of which I can --"
" Peste !"
broke from the Marquis behind , whose face had suddenly darkened , " let us stop talking and begin ," and he slashed off the head of a tall flower with his stick .
Syme understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over his shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight .
He offered one to the Marquis , who snatched it without ceremony , and another to Syme , who took it , bent it , and poised it with as much delay as was consistent with dignity .
Then the Colonel took out another pair of blades , and taking one himself and giving another to Dr . Bull , proceeded to place the men .
Then came an interruption and a change .
Then he turned on Syme a face transfigured to that of a fiend , and began to fight as if with twenty weapons .
But the Marquis ' s morbid energy over - reached itself .
Surely the man had a charmed life .
But this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy - turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him .
said the Marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary obedience .
asked Colonel Ducroix , staring .
" Our principal has wounded the Marquis four times at least , and he is none the worse ."
" Please let me speak ," he said .
said the Marquis in exasperation .
and he bent slightly forward with a fascinating smile .
The Paris train , panting and groaning , had grated into a little station behind the neighbouring hill .
" If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow ," he said , " he can have it .
It ' s the kind of thing that might come in useful any day ," and he gravely tore off one of his swarthy Assyrian brows , bringing about half his brown forehead with it , and politely offered it to the Colonel , who stood crimson and speechless with rage .
I tell you the train has come into the station !"
cried the other , tearing his hair , which came off easily .
" Have you all got softening of the brain , that you don ' t realise what I am ?
Twenty Paris trains might go by for me .
Damn Paris trains !"
" What did I care about ?
it has caught me ."
Sunday has us now in the hollow of his hand ."
The Professor gave a tired gesture .
The little man named Bull , had , like many men who seem to be of a mere vivacious vulgarity , sudden movements of good taste .
A secret society of anarchists is hunting us like hares ; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvation or German philosophy , but a rich and powerful and fanatical church , a church of eastern pessimism , which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin .
The sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow - townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual , and , upon the whole , sufficient for one day .
Colonel Ducroix moved mechanically , but then tugged abruptly at his white moustache and broke out --
If these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of low wreckers like that , I ' ll see them through it .
" Yes ," retorted Ratcliffe , " he may be with them ."
" With the people out of that train ," said the other .
" It means that we are struck dead !
asked Syme with a sort of steadiness .
Syme uttered an involuntary cry , and they all turned their eyes towards the far - off station .
CHAPTER XI
" As you very truly say , they are on the horizon ; but if he were walking with them .
I believe this ground would shake ."
Even the solid figures walking with him Syme could hardly see for the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them .
Now a man ' s head was lit as with a light of Rembrandt , leaving all else obliterated ; now again he had strong and staring white hands with the face of a negro .
That tragic self - confidence which he had felt when he believed that the Marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was a friend .
The Marquis had taken off his nose and turned out to be a detective .
" They can ' t be running the real world in that way .
The rich man hasn ' t ; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht .
Those dogs are all on foot , and we could soon leave them behind ."
" I have piles of money on me ."
" Oh , if he haggles !"
He told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above Lancy , where the innkeeper , an old soldier who had become devot in his latter years , would be certain to sympathise with them , and even to take risks in their support .
The level of the sunlit landscape , though flat as a whole , fell away on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea , in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the Sussex downs .
The travelling cloud of their enemies had wholly disappeared from the horizon .
Syme looked up at the wall , and saw a crudely - painted and pathetic religious picture .
I had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline .
You have not a moment to waste ."
Almost as he spoke , the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white hair came ambling into the room , and announced that six horses were saddled outside .
Syme had a fixed , superstitious fancy , left in his mind by the chance phrase of the Colonel , that this was indeed , perhaps , the last honest stranger whom he should ever see upon the earth .
CHAPTER XII
" But we may not get it ," said Bull .
The Colonel ' s face had an instantaneous change , as if lightning had struck it , and yet left it scatheless .
" They have done us ," he said , with brief military irony .
" Prepare to receive cavalry !"
Swiftly as they rode , however , the whole rank still kept well together , and they could see the black vizards of the first line as level as a line of uniforms .
Either they had been longer in the place than they imagined , or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the town .
" No ," corrected the Professor , " a horse ."
" I am afraid it ' s no go ."
While our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel , I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to Renard , who was standing in his own porch , you will remember .
He looked up , blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front hall .
Hitherto they had passed through the quietest part of the town , meeting at most one or two pedestrians , who could give them no hint of the peace or the hostility of the place .
Dr . Bull turned to the new detective who had led their flight , and permitted himself one of his natural and friendly smiles .
" If you really think that ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists , you must be madder than an anarchist yourself .
While they were speaking the Professor had leant forward with sudden excitement .
he said .
No ," said the Professor , " it is not horses , and it is not behind us ."
" Dr . Renard would never give them his cars ."
The thing is nonsense .
The staring Colonel was long past minding satire .
We shall soon get there ."
But the rest of the street , especially the two ends of it , was in the deepest twilight , and for some seconds they could see nothing .
The car crawled about a hundred yards farther , and then they were all startled by Dr . Bull breaking into a high crow of laughter .
That crowd ' s as law - abiding as a cow , and if it weren ' t , it ' s on our side ."
" What a fool I ' ve been !"
Dr .
" Well ," said the cigarette smoker slowly , " what do you think now ?"
" I think ," said Dr . Bull with precision , " that I am lying in bed at No .
" You are a very fine fellow ," he said .
" I tell you it can ' t be !"
" Don ' t be in such a hurry ," drawled the smoker .
Give the Colonel a chance ."
In fact , I seem to see there another friend of yours , Syme ."
The next moment , with shattering violence , he had swung the motor round and sent it dashing down the steep side street to the sea , like a man that desired only to die .
said the Professor , and buried his face in his hands .
asked the Professor .
The instant after that four men had crawled out from under a chaos of metal , and a tall lean lamp - post that had stood up straight on the edge of the marine parade stood out , bent and twisted , like the branch of a broken tree .
" What does it matter who is mad or who is sane ?
We shall all be dead soon ."
" He is extremely comfortable .
The glare of a chance lantern lit up the faces of the two foremost .
They were in earnest consultation .
" Everything ' s gone .
" Do you see this lantern ?"
Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall not destroy .
He struck the Secretary once with the lantern so that he staggered ; and then , whirling it twice round his head , sent it flying far out to sea , where it flared like a roaring rocket and fell .
I arrest you in the name of the law ."
I knew I couldn ' t be wrong about the mob ," he said , beaming over the enormous multitude , which stretched away to the distance on both sides .
I ' m vulgar myself , and I know .
" But whatever else Sunday is , he isn ' t a blameless citizen .
" Well ," said the Secretary , " I suppose we can find out soon , for tomorrow we have our next general meeting .
They finished their journey at an hotel in Piccadilly Circus , so as to be close to the early breakfast next morning in Leicester Square .
Dr . Bull , discontented with the general proposal to go to bed , had strolled out of the hotel at about eleven to see and taste some of the beauties of London .
Twenty minutes afterwards , however , he came back and made quite a clamour in the hall .
" Whom ?"
" Not the President ?"
he cried .
Next morning the battalion of the reunited six marched stolidly towards the hotel in Leicester Square .
" I think it is six men going to ask one man what they mean ."
They turned in silence into the Square , and though the hotel was in the opposite corner , they saw at once the little balcony and a figure that looked too big for it .
But all his councillors , who had come to vote him down , crossed that Square as if they were watched out of heaven by a hundred eyes .
They had disputed much upon their policy , about whether they should leave the unmasked Gogol without and begin diplomatically , or whether they should bring him in and blow up the gunpowder at once .
I bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles ."
" My spectacles are blackguardly ," he said , " but I ' m not .
What are you ?
Answer me , I tell you ."
" You want to know what I am , do you ?
But I have never been caught yet , and the skies will fall in the time I turn to bay .
But Syme was in no mood for delicacies , and he stood up in his own cab shouting , " Stop thief !"
Syme caught the thing while instinctively warding it off , and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled papers .
And here there occurred what seemed to the allies a providential stoppage .
Traffic of every kind was swerving to right or left or stopping , for down the long road was coming the unmistakable roar announcing the fire - engine , which in a few seconds went by like a brazen thunderbolt .
Before the three cabs , however , could reach up to the spot , he had gone up the high railings like a huge grey cat , tossed himself over , and vanished in a darkness of leaves .
Syme with a furious gesture stopped his cab , jumped out , and sprang also to the escalade .
" All the better ," said the Secretary grimly , planting a foot in a foothold , " we shall find him at home ."
Nothing was in sight , but Dr . Bull suddenly struck his hands together .
" Has it come this way ?"
asked Syme .
" He has run away with an old gentleman ," said the other stranger breathlessly , " a poor old gentleman with white hair ! "
The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement .
As they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had vanished , Syme felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in the cages which they passed .
But at their rate of racing it fell far behind , just by the cab containing Gogol ; and in faint hope of a clue or for some impulse unexplainable , he stopped his cab so as to pick it up .
When the last covering was torn away it reduced itself to a small slip of paper , on which was written :--
" The word , I fancy , should be ' pink '."
Through street after street , through district after district , went the prodigy of the flying elephant , calling crowds to every window , and driving the traffic left and right .
He held out with distaste a piece of folded paper , addressed : " To the Secretary of the Central Anarchist Council ."
Do --"
shouted Syme suddenly .
demanded the Secretary .
" Nothing ," said Syme , " except that it isn ' t captive !'
A second afterwards the string came in two just under the car , and the balloon , broken loose , floated away with the freedom of a soap bubble .
" God bless my soul !"
" I ' m not beaten yet .
THE SIX PHILOSOPHERS
ACROSS green fields , and breaking through blooming hedges , toiled six draggled detectives , about five miles out of London .
Those green hills of Surrey saw the final collapse and tragedy of the admirable light grey suit in which Syme had set out from Saffron Park .
" It is singularly and strangely beautiful !"
It might hurt the old boy ."
Little Snowdrop !"
Sunday would say he was anybody ."
" I don ' t know whether I believe it or not ," said Dr . Bull .
" I ' ve got it now ," cried Bull , " it was because he was so fat and so light .
.
how can I tell you ?
.
" You do not know Sunday at all .
For when I first saw Sunday he expressed to me , not your airy vitality , but something both gross and sad in the Nature of Things .
He sat there on a bench , a huge heap of a man , dark and out of shape .
I poured out my most passionate appeals , and asked my most eloquent questions .
I could only tell myself , from its shudderings , that it was something at least that such a monster could be miserable .
The Professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick , and he did not answer at all .
The eye was so far away from the nose , that it wasn ' t an eye .
Oh , the doubts of a materialist are not worth a dump .
Bull finds him like the earth in spring , Gogol like the sun at noonday .
This is queer , but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd notion about the President , and I also find that I think of Sunday as I think of the whole world ."
" Get on a little faster , Syme ," said Bull ; " never mind the balloon ."
" It was like the face of some ancient archangel , judging justly after heroic wars .
But when I saw him from behind I was certain he was an animal , and when I saw him in front I knew he was a god ."
Bad is so bad , that we cannot but think good an accident ; good is so good , that we feel certain that evil could be explained .
Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face ?
" Look !"
He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky , right itself , and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun .
" Dead !"
snorted the Secretary .
" Clashing his hoofs ," said the Professor .
" So he is ," said the Professor , " in Greek .
He strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy , his rags and ribbons fluttering in the wind .
" Where is this carriage ?"
" Show us the place ," Syme said briefly , and without a word the man in the violet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the hedge , which let in suddenly the light of a white road .
" I have no clothes except these ," and he lifted two long strips of his frock - coat in fascinating festoons , and made a movement as if to twirl like a ballet girl .
" My master asks me to say ," said the attendant , that there is a fancy dress ball tonight , and that he desires you to put on the costume that I have laid out .
But really I do not want either of them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means , and what sort of costume you have got laid out for me .
It was that in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the creation of the sun and moon .
But though he affected to despise the mummery , he felt a curious freedom and naturalness in his movements as the blue and gold garment fell about him ; and when he found that he had to wear a sword , it stirred a boyish dream .
For these disguises did not disguise , but reveal .
THE ACCUSER
AS Syme strode along the corridor he saw the Secretary standing at the top of a great flight of stairs .
For if the Secretary stood for that philosopher who loves the original and formless light , Syme was a type of the poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes , to split it up into sun and star .
As they descended the broad stairs together they overtook Ratcliffe , who was clad in spring green like a huntsman , and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees .
They were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old English garden , full of torches and bonfires , by the broken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress .
There was a man dressed as a windmill with enormous sails , a man dressed as an elephant , a man dressed as a balloon ; the two last , together , seemed to keep the thread of their farcical adventures .
He lay back in his chair with a broad smile , the picture of an optimist in his element .
One by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their strange seats .
Almost as Syme heard the words , he saw on the sea of human faces in front of him a frightful and beautiful alteration , as if heaven had opened behind his head .
Finally the last stray merry - maker ran into the house whooping to his companions .
I sat in the darkness , where there is not any created thing , and to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue .
Syme stirred sharply in his seat , but otherwise there was silence , and the incomprehensible went on .
I know how you , Thursday , crossed swords with King Satan , and how you , Wednesday , named me in the hour without hope ."
If you were from the first our father and our friend , why were you also our greatest enemy ?
I am grateful to you , not only for wine and hospitality here , but for many a fine scamper and free fight .
" It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and fought yourself ."
" I am not happy ," said the Professor with his head in his hands , " because I do not understand .
" I have heard your complaints in order .
The falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam , like a bar of burning gold , across the dim grass .
He seemed to have a fine close suit with knee - breeches such as that which was worn by the servants of the house , only that it was not blue , but of this absolute sable .
" Why , this is the real anarchist !"
" Yes ," said Gregory , with a great and dangerous restraint , " I am the real anarchist ."
" I am a destroyer .
" I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything ; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you ! "
We in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government .
But Syme could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his body and a crystal simplicity in his mind that seemed to be superior to everything that he said or did .
Dawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and timid ; as if Nature made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose .
[ The Parent ' s Assistant , by Maria Edgeworth ]
Near the ruins of the castle of Rossmore , in Ireland , is a small cabin , in which there once lived a widow and her four children .
" No need to stop the wheel , Mary , dear , for me ," said her mother , " I was not asleep ; nor is it THAT which keeps me from sleep .
But don ' t overwork yourself , Mary ."
" So was I once ," said her mother .
And one thing comforts my heart , even as I AM lying here , that not a soul in the wide world I am leaving has to complain of me .
Mary went immediately to Mr . Hopkins , the agent , to pay her rent ; and she begged of him to let her stay another year in her cabin ; but this he refused .
The chest was carried for them by some of the charitable neighbours , who likewise added to their scanty stock of potatoes and turf what would make it last through the winter .
So one helped to thatch the room in which they were to sleep , and another took their cow to graze upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk ; and one and all said they should be welcome to take share of their potatoes and buttermilk if they should find their own ever fall short .
She said that she could afford to wait for her money till Mary was able to pay it ; that she knew her to be an honest , industrious little girl , and she would trust her with more than a guinea .
When they had done work one day , Annie went to the master of the paper - mill and asked him if she might have two sheets of large white paper which were lying on the press .
This servant was an Englishman , and he was but newly come over to Ireland .
The largest and longest are the best .
Decayed labourers , women , and children make it their business to procure and prepare them .
When these junci are thus far prepared , they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take the dew for some nights , and afterwards be dried in the sun .
Some address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or grease ; but this knack is also to be attained by practice .
He found his new way of life very pleasant ; for he was well fed , well clothed , and well treated ; and he every day learned more of his business , in which at first he was rather awkward .
He told his sister Mary of his distress , and she made for him , after many trials , a pair of cloth shoes , with soles of platted hemp .
The last - maker made a last for her , and over this Mary sewed the calico vamps tight .
When the shoes were completed , Isabella and Caroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance , and got three shillings a pair for them .
They had great pleasure in giving to this industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity , which she received with some surprise and more gratitude .
Edmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning , provided he was back again before eight o ' clock .
It was his business to hammer the soles flat : and as soon as he came home every morning he performed his task with so much cheerfulness and sang so merrily at his work , that the hour of his arrival was always an hour of joy to the family .
One morning Edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very early , and they were busy at their work , all sitting round the meal chest , which served them for a table .
Whilst George was washing his hands , two other little children , who had just finished their morning ' s work , came to him to beg that he would blow some soap bubbles for them , and they were all three eagerly blowing bubbles , and watching them mount into the air , when suddenly they were startled by a noise as loud as thunder .
They were in a sort of outer court of the castle , next to the room in which all their companions were at work , and they ran precipitately into the room , exclaiming , " Did you hear that noise ?"
The children turned pale and stood motionless ; but Edmund threw down his hammer , and ran out to see what was the matter .
Edmund , who was a courageous lad , and proud of showing his courage , laughed at their cowardice ; but Mary , who was very prudent , persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason , who was building at his master ' s , to come and give his opinion , whether their part of the castle was safe to live in or not .
The mason came , and gave it as his opinion that the rooms they inhabited might last through the winter but that no part of the ruins could stand another year .
" Your poor goat is dead ," replied Peggy .
Peggy and Anne were convinced by what Mary said , and they begged to go along with her and their brother , to take the coins to Mr . Hopkins .
On their way they stopped at the vicarage , to show the treasure to Mr . Gilbert , who took it to the young ladies , Isabella and Caroline , and told them how it had been found .
They also begged that their father , who was well acquainted with Mr . Harvey , the gentleman to whom Rossmore Castle belonged , to write to him , and tell him how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had found .
This old woman was well known amongst the country people by the name of Goody Grope :* because she had , for many years , been in the habit of groping in old castles , and in moats ,** and at the bottom of a round tower *** in the neighbourhood , in search of treasure .
Collyogh is the Irish appellation of an old woman : but as Collyogh might sound strangely to English ears , we have translated it by the word Goody .
I was told it was more than twenty miles from our bog or I would have been here long ago ; but better late than never ."
She set her elbow upon her knees , and stopping her ears with her hands bid Mary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders ; for that , let them say what they would , she would fall to work the next morning , " BARRING you ' ll make it worth my while to let it alone ."
I remember it as well as if it was this instant ."
" I ' ll go to him no more ," said Edmund , sturdily .
The buzz of scandal went on for some time without reaching their ears , because they lived very retiredly .
Where ' s the gold that you found at Rossmore Castle ?"
One night as Mary was going to bed , she heard someone knocking hard at the door .
" Give me sixpence , and I ' ll tell you ," said Betsy ; " but waken Anne and Peggy .
" DEAR MARY , NANCY , AND LITTLE PEG ,--
joy !-- I always said the truth would come out at last ; and that he could not take our good name from us .
To comprehend why Edmund is joyful , our readers must be informed of certain things which happened after Isabella and Caroline went to Dublin .
She had a small neat cottage , and there was not a weed to be seen in her garden .
As to her strawberries , she did not send them to market , because it was the custom for numbers of people to come from Clifton , in the summer time , to eat strawberries and cream at the gardens in Ashton .
Now , the widow Preston was so obliging , active and good - humoured , that everyone who came to see her was pleased .
" Why do you sigh , mother ?"
" Finish thy supper , child ."
cried Jem , swallowing the last mouthful hastily , as if he thought he had been too long at supper --" and now for the great needle ; I must see and mend Lightfoot ' s bridle afore I go to bed ."
Oh , la , no , not he -- never was so well of his lameness in all his life .
" Lightfoot !"
no : but I MUST , Jem ."
Jem was silent for a few minutes --" Two guineas , that ' s a great , great deal .
He did not waste his time waiting for her , but saddled and bridled Lightfoot , and went to Farmer Truck ' s for the giant strawberries .
A great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground ; and , as soon as that was finished , he set out again in quest of the old woman , whom , to his great joy , he spied sitting at her corner of the street with her board before her .
Jem , encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this , ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman .
His father was an ale - house keeper , and being generally drunk , could take no care of his son ; so that Lazy Lawrence grew every day worse and worse .
" What are you doing there ?"
" What are you thinking of ?"
" I don ' t know -- because I can ' t find anybody to play with me to - day .
Come along , my lad ; we can but try ."
The lady looked very sorry , which Jem observing , he took the opportunity , whilst she was busy looking over the sailor ' s bag of shells , to gather together all the feathers , and sort them according to their different colours , as he had seen them sorted when he first came into the room .
THAT , instead of encouraging you to be industrious , would teach you to be idle ."
He was just come home from work , and was surprised when Jem showed him the half - crown , saying , " Look what I got for the stones ; you are to have half , you know ."
The gardener will mark it off for you ; and when you ' ve done , the rest of the day you may do what you please ."
He was as fond of play as any little boy could be ; and when he was at it he played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable ; so as soon as he had finished his task , fed Lightfoot , and put by the sixpence he had earned that day , he ran to the playground in the village , where he found a party of boys playing , and amongst them Lazy Lawrence , who indeed was not playing , but lounging upon a gate , with his thumb in his mouth .
" Ah , no , I can ' t run , indeed ," said he , hanging back heavily ; " you know I can play all day long if I like it , so I don ' t mind play as you do , who have only one hour for it ."
" So much the worse for you .
You never had more than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life ."
" You have not !"
" And how did you come by it -- honestly ?"
" That ' s a secret ," said Jem , looking great .
Don ' t you love nuts ?
I ' d buy nuts enough to last me from this time to Christmas , and I ' d make little Newton crack ' em for me , for that ' s the worst of nuts ; there ' s the trouble of cracking ' em ."
When he got home he heard his father talking very loud , and at first he thought he was drunk ; but when he opened the kitchen door , he saw that he was not drunk , but angry .
cried he , turning suddenly upon Lawrence , and gave him such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes ; " you lazy dog !
" Now , did not I order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the cellar , and did not I charge you to wire the corks ?
why don ' t you move , I say ?
And he shook him till Lawrence was so giddy he could not stand .
What had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider , my Worcestershire cider , to the cellar when I bid you ?
So saying , he pushed him out of the house door , and Lawrence sneaked off , seeing that this was no time to make his petition for halfpence .
Lawrence was moved at the sound , and said to himself , " If _I_ begin with one halfpenny I may end , like him , with having twopence ; and it is easier to play at pitch farthing than to work ."
" Head or tail ?"
cried he .
He seized the penny , surprised at his own success , and would have gone instantly to have laid it out in nuts ; but the stable boy stopped him , and tempted him to throw again .
This time Lawrence lost ; he threw again and won ; and so he went on , sometimes losing , but most frequently winning , till half the morning was lost .
As this was an amusement which he could enjoy without any sort of exertion , he soon grew so fond of it , that every day he returned to the stable yard , and the horse block became his constant seat .
One day , after Jem had finished his task , the gardener asked him to stay a little while , to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall .
said she , " you are making here -- why don ' t you wipe your shoes upon the mat ?"
" No , ma ' am ," said the gardener , " nor I don ' t know when , if ever , the man will bring home those mats you bespoke , ma ' am ."
But what toil !
But still he persevered .
Make as many more such mats as you can , and I will take care and dispose of them for you ."
The next day he went to work to make more mats , and he soon learned to make them so well and quickly , that he was surprised at his own success .
In every one he made he found less difficulty , so that , instead of making two , he could soon make four in a day .
Presently a folding - door , at one end of the hall , opened , and he saw his mistress , with a great many gentlemen and ladies , rising from several tables .
" Oh !
there is my little boy and his mats ," cried the lady ; and , followed by all the rest of the company , she came into the hall .
" Well ," said the lady , smiling , " what do you see that makes you look so surprised ?"
" That all my mats are gone ," said Jem ; " but you are very welcome ."
" Are we ?"
" Not now ," said the lady , laughing ; " but I will come to Ashton to - morrow evening ; perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries ."
He now went home , but felt it a great restraint to wait till to - morrow evening before he told his mother .
To console himself he flew to the stable :--" Lightfoot , you ' re not to be sold on Monday , poor fellow !"
" But I have something else to do ," said Jem , laughing , " so I shall not go ."
" One day in the year , sure , there ' s no harm in being merry ," said the stable boy .
Come , you ' ll go , won ' t you ?"
" No ," said Jem , still looking as if he did not like to talk before the ill - looking stranger .
Then he got up , dressed himself , and opened his window .
whispered Lawrence , groping about , " where are you ?
said the wicked boy , as Lawrence laid hold of him ; " how cold it feels ."
" It is no time to go back ," replied the other , opening the door ; " you ' ve gone too far now to go back ," and he pushed Lawrence into the stable .
The black cloud had now passed over the moon , and the light shone full upon them .
Not another word passed .
All night he was starting from frightful dreams ; or else , broad awake , he lay listening to every small noise , unable to stir , and scarcely daring to breathe -- tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds of fear , that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience .
It was Sunday morning , and the bell rang for church .
" Pale ?"
It was agreed that as soon as the dusk of the evening came on , they should go together into a certain lonely field , and there divide their booty .
" Now , keep those spirits of yours , Jem , till you want ' em , and don ' t let it come upon you all at once .
Have it in mind that to - morrow ' s fair day , and Lightfoot must go .
He won ' t bring him out till the last minute ; so do sit ye down , neighbour ."
" God bless the boy !"
She went up to him , and then leaning his head against her , he cried , " It ' s gone !-- it ' s all gone !"
" I saw them safe last night , and was showing ' em to Lightfoot ; and I was so glad to think I had earned them all myself ; and I thought how surprised you ' d look , and how glad you ' d be , and how you ' d kiss me , and all !"
" Why , don ' t you remember ?"
" Nay , ask mammy ," said Jem , a little offended ; and when afterwards the lady went on questioning him in a severe manner , as if she did not believe him , he at last made no answer .
said his mother .
" He IS a good horse !"
" I see it -- I know it ," said Jem , out of breath with anxiety .
He gave her his knife .
The latter had on a red jacket , which little Jem immediately recollected , and scarcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on horseback .
The footman rode on as fast as the people would let him .
A man who was half drunk pushed his way forwards , swearing that nobody should stop him ; that he had a right to see -- and he WOULD see .
" I don ' t know , except it was idleness ."
How often when he was little we used , as he lounged about , to tell him that idleness was the root of all evil ."
He was found early and late at his work , established a new character , and for ever lost the name of " Lazy Lawrence ."
Mr . Spencer , a very benevolent and sensible man , undertook the education of several poor children .
Among the rest was a boy of the name of Franklin , whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old .
" Philanthropic Society ; yes ," said her mistress ; " and my brother gives him a high character : I hope he will do very well ."
This little boy , to be sure , was unfortunate in his father , but he has had an excellent education ."
But then , ma ' am , edication can ' t change the NATUR that ' s in one , they say ; and one ' s that born naturally bad and low , they say , all the edication in the world won ' t do no good ; and , for my part , ma ' am , I know you knows best ; but I should be afraid to let any of those Villaintropic folks get into my house ; for nobody can tell the natur of them aforehand .
I declare it frights me ."
However , upon calling to mind all that his friend Mr . Spencer had ever said to him , he could not recollect his having warned him that shoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good servant ; so that he could only comfort himself with resolving , if possible , to make amends for these deficiencies , and to dissipate the prejudices which he saw were formed against him , by the strictest adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty .
He hoped to secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all her commands , and faithful care of all that belonged to her .
But one unfortunate night the butler was gone out ; the bell rang : he went upstairs ; and his mistress asking where Corkscrew was , he answered that he was gone out .
" I don ' t know ," answered Franklin .
But no apology coming all day , Franklin at last ventured to request an explanation , or rather , to ask what he had best do on the next occasion .
" Was I ?"
Yet when the danger was over , and the hour of adversity had past , the ungrateful cook would forget her benefactor , and , when it came to his supper time , would throw him , with a carelessness that touched him sensibly , anything which the other servants were too nice to eat .
Other people looked more maliciously ; but , as he felt himself perfectly innocent , he went on eating his dinner in silence .
" You thought you saw !"
In fact , Felix had till now professed himself his firm ally , and had on his part received from Franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship ; for it must be told that every other morning , when it was Felix ' s turn to get breakfast , Felix never was up in decent time , and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if Franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him , the bread and butter spread , and the toast toasted ; and had not , moreover , regularly , when the clock struck eight , and Mrs . Pomfret ' s foot was heard overhead , run to call the sleeping Felix , and helped him constantly through the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper came downstairs .
Pomfret ," said she , opening the housekeeper ' s room door , " have you a bit of paper ?"
Manchon leaped up , and was not to be rebuffed .
down !
repeated his mistress , waiting for his reply with a calm air of attention , which still more disconcerted Felix ; for , though with an angry person he might have some chance of escape , he knew that he could not invent any excuse in such circumstances , which could stand the examination of a person in her sober senses .
He knew how to bring his charge home to her .
Corkscrew frequently , after he had finished taking away supper , and after the housekeeper was gone to bed , sallied forth to a neighbouring alehouse to drink with his friends .
One of the men actually offered to lend Corkscrew three guineas towards the payment of his debt , and hinted that , if he thought proper , he could easily get the whole cleared off .
The butler knew not what to do when he saw that Felix was absolutely determined either to betray their scheme , or to become a sharer in the booty .
It is said by those whose fatal experience gives them a right to be believed , that a drunkard will sacrifice anything , everything , sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication .
The hour of rendezvous came , and Corkscrew went to the alehouse , where he found the housebreakers waiting for him , and a glass of brandy ready poured out .
This was no very difficult task ; he had a strong desire to have some worked cravats , and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient bribe .
He jumped up , and seeing a light under the butler ' s door , gently opened it , and to his astonishment , beheld one of the bed curtains in flames .
He immediately ran to the butler , and pulled him with all his force , to rouse him from his lethargy .
He exerted himself with so much good sense , that the fire was presently extinguished .
Indeed , ma ' am you forget ."
" I won ' t please to recollect just whatever you please , sir !
" Dear me !
he that I was always scolding and scolding , enough to make him hate me .
" Take care that you don ' t go from one extreme into another , Pomfret ; don ' t spoil the boy ."
" Pray desire ," continued her mistress , " that he will bring up breakfast this morning ; and leave the key of the house - door , Pomfret , with me ."
" How long have you lived with me ?"
" I believe , madam , it is the key of the house - door ."
Franklin stood silent , with a firm but modest look .
" I will , madam , do anything you order me ," said Franklin , and received the key from her hands .
The butler never attempted his usual midnight visits to the alehouse , but went to bed in proper time , and paid particular court to Mrs Pomfret , in order to dispel her suspicions .
Corkscrew , by the housekeeper ' s means , ventured to present a petition that he might go to the play the next day , and his request was granted .
" And do you think mistress would let you if I asked ?"
" No ," said Franklin , sighing .
" But stay ," said Corkscrew , " what I am thinking of is , that if mistress will let you go , I ' ll treat you myself , rather than that you should he disappointed ."
" But how will she know anything of the matter ?
" Very well , sir ," said Franklin , sorrowfully , but with steadiness .
" I don ' t doubt THAT ," answered Franklin .
" Shake hands ," said Corkscrew , " I am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow !"
" But you have lost , I understand , the pleasure of going to the play to - night ."
" Are Corkscrew and Felix GONE to the play ?"
Nothing at first appeared in Corkscrew ' s bedchamber , to strengthen their suspicions , till , just as they were going to leave the room , Mrs . Pomfret exclaimed , " Why , if there is not Mr . Corkscrew ' s dress coat hanging up there !
Look at the cravat .
" You shall have both , indeed , Mrs . Pomfret ; but don ' t make such a noise , for everybody will hear you ."
The love of mystery was the only thing which could have conquered Mrs . Pomfret ' s love of talking .
Corkscrew and his accomplices went directly to the pantry ; and there Mr . Spencer and the constable immediately secured them , as they were carrying off their booty .
exclaimed Mrs . Pomfret , with unfeigned joy , " I ' m sure you are very good ; and I ' m very glad of it ."
This attorney began the world with nothing , but he contrived to scrape together a good deal of money , everybody knew how .
He built a new house at the entrance of the village , and had a large , well fenced garden , yet , notwithstanding his fences , he never felt himself secure .
Indeed , so careful were even the village children of giving offence to this irritable man of the law , that they would not venture to fly a kite near his fields lest it should entangle in his trees , or fall upon his meadow .
He sent his son to learn Latin ; he hired a maid to wait upon his daughter Barbara ; and he strictly forbade her thenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children , who had hitherto been her playfellows .
Sometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds , or weeding the borders ; sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for her bees ; sometimes she was in the poultry yard , scattering corn from her sieve amongst the eager chickens ; and in the evening she was often seated in a little honeysuckle arbour , with a clean , light , three - legged deal table before her , upon which she put her plain work .
She always shows us where the nicest flowers are to be found in the lanes and meadows ," said they .
" Attorney Case dined at the Abbey to - day -- luckily for us .
I wish he and his daughter Bab , or Miss Barbara , as she must now be called , were a hundred miles off , out of our way , I know .
No later than yesterday she threw down my nine - pins in one of her ill - humours , as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the dust ."
" Yes ," cried Mary , the little primrose - girl , " her gown is always trailing .
I know what he thought of Bab by his looks , and of Susan , too ; for Susan was in her garden , bending down a branch of the laburnum - tree , looking at its yellow flowers , which were just come out ; and when the gentleman asked her how many miles it was from Shrewsbury , she answered him so modest !-- not bashful , like as if she had never seen nobody before -- but just right ; and then she pulled on her straw hat , which was fallen back with her looking up at the laburnum , and she went her ways home ; and the gentleman says to me , after she was gone , ' Pray , who is that neat , modest girl --?'
" Take it , then , child ," said he , pulling it off --" I shall soon have no coat to dry -- and take my hat , too ," said he , throwing it upon the ground .
" Shut the gate ," said Barbara , " you have no business in our garden ; and as for your hen , I shall keep it ; it is always flying in here , and plaguing us , and my father says it is a trespasser ; and he told me I might catch it and keep it the next time it got in , and it is in now ."
said Susan , " don ' t wait for me ; I can ' t come to you , but ," added she , pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden , " gather those for poor little Mary ; I promised them to her , and tell her the violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile , on the right as we go to church .
He has found what he calls a flaw in my lease ; and the lease , he tells me , is not worth a farthing , and that he can turn us all out of our farm to - morrow if he pleases ; and sure enough he will please , for I have thwarted him this day , and he swears he ' ll be revenged of me .
Indeed , he has begun with me badly enough already .
Here Farmer Price made a dead stop ; and his wife and Susan looked up in his face , breathless with anxiety .
" As how , Mr .
Case ?"
said the farmer .
" I ' m under the necessity of calling in the money I lent you some time ago , and you will please to take notice , that it must be paid to - morrow morning .
it ' s none of mine , I never take what does not belong to me ."
" None ."
All I want of you to say --"
" Ah , my lease ," said the farmer , who had almost forgot to ask for it till he was thus put in mind of it by the attorney ' s imprudent threat .
As it approached nearer , she knew that it was Philip playing upon his pipe and tabor .
" Will you , dear Rose ?"
Susan kissed the little breathless girl , and returned softly to the side of her mother ' s bed .
How painful it is to awake to the remembrance of misfortune .
Gradually as this poor woman collected her scattered thoughts , she recalled the circumstances of the preceding evening .
She said that Susan never did too little , or too much .
" How does your mother do , in the first place ?"
This is the money that has been given to us in the village this May morning .
Now we are a match for Miss Barbara .
Miss Barbara ' s maid Betty was the first person that was visible at the attorney ' s house .
" Dear , how you STARTLED me !
The shillings sounded provoking upon the table , as she threw them down one after another , and Barbara coolly replied , " Three won ' t do ."
Barbara shook her head .
" Well ," said Rose , " shall I go back for the guinea - hen ?"
She told her mind to Rose , and concluded by saying , decidedly , that " if the money was given to her to dispose of as she pleased , she would give it to her father ."
" It is all yours , my dear , good Susan ," cried Rose , with a look of warm approbation .
Why , I ' ll answer for it , the guinea - hen won ' t make her happy , and you ' ll be happy EVEN without ; because you are good .
Susan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of her needle , and that she would most willingly accept of her services , but that UNLUCKILY she had finished all the needle work immediately wanted .
Susan , who had always been attentive to what her mother taught her , and who had often assisted her when she was baking bread and cakes for the family at the Abbey , had now formed the courageous , but not presumptuous idea , that she could herself undertake to bake a batch of bread .
Inquiries were made from the housekeeper , and they heard , with some surprise , that this excellent bread was made by a young girl only twelve years old .
" Little I can ' t so well call her now , since she ' s grown tall and slender to look at ; and glad I am she is grown up likely to look at ; for handsome is that handsome does ; she thinks no more of her being handsome than I do myself ; yet she has as proper a respect for herself , ma ' am , as you have ; and I always see her neat , and with her mother , ma ' am , or fit people , as a girl should be .
They were not of that race of fine ladies who are miserable the moment they come to THE COUNTRY ; nor yet were they of that bustling sort , who quack and direct all their poor neighbours , for the mere love of managing , or the want of something to do .
" So , Susan ," said Bab , who came close up to her before she perceived it , " how goes the world with you to - day ?"
she saw Miss Somers !
Can ' t you stop gathering those things for a minute , and chat a bit with us , Susan ?"
" I can ' t stay , indeed , Miss Barbara ; for my mother ' s broth is just wanted , and I ' m in a hurry ."
Susan ran home .
" What do you think she could mean ?"
She tasted it , and added now a little salt , and now a little more , till she thought it was just to her mother ' s taste .
" Won ' t you take a spoon ?"
said Susan , trembling at the large mouthfuls which Barbara sucked up with a terrible noise .
The next time I set my foot in this house , you shall be as saucy to me as you please ."
"* The saying become proverbial in the village .
What need have you to trouble her for news about the Abbey folks , when your own papa has been there all the morning , and is just come in , and can tell you everything ?"
She ran into her father ' s parlour ; but she knew , the moment she saw his face , that it was no time to ask questions ; his pen was across his mouth , and his brown wig pushed oblique upon his contracted forehead .
The attorney could not persuade himself to believe that his benevolence was anything but enlightened cunning , and his plain dealing he one minute dreaded as the masterpiece of art , and the next despised as the characteristic of folly .
" I am come ," said Sir Arthur , " to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the country which I prefer to all others , and amongst people whose happiness I hope to increase ."
A map of it was lying upon the table , and Farmer Price ' s garden came exactly across the new road for the ride .
As I told you before , sir , I ' d pledge my whole credit upon the thing -- I ' d stake my existence ."
Sir Arthur stood in silence .
The courtiers of Louis the Fourteenth could not have looked more astounded than our attorney , when they received from their monarch a similar answer .
It was this unexpected reply of Sir Arthur ' s which had deranged the temper of Mr . Case , and caused his wig to stand so crooked upon his forehead , and which had rendered him impenetrably silent to his inquisitive daughter Barbara .
" I know of one ," cried Barbara .
" Susan Price has a pet lamb that ' s as fat as fat could be ."
" Where is it ?"
Undraw the curtain , that I may see you , and tell me ;-- I thought I heard some strange voice just now talking to my child .
" Would you think it amiss , then , my dear mother ," said Susan , stooping to kiss her --" would you think it amiss , if my father was to stay with us a week longer ?"
inquired her mother .
" How do you know ?
She was called out of the room at this moment , for a messenger was come from the Abbey for the bread - bills .
It was she who always made out the bills , for though she had not a great number of lessons from the writing - master , she had taken so much pains to learn that she could write a very neat , legible hand , and she found this very useful .
Look at it ."
Susan looked and blushed ; it was written , " Sir Arthur Somers , to John Price , debtor , six dozen LAMBS , so much ."
All of them , I think , seem to be wrong , if I can read ," said her father , rather angrily , and he pointed out to her sundry strange mistakes .
Susan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his week ' s reprieve till he should come home to sup , as he had promised to do , in her mother ' s room .
The music seemed to be near the spot where the children were standing , and they looked round to see whence it could come .
Susan pointed to the great oak - tree , and they beheld , seated under its shade , an old man playing upon his harp .
Susan ' s voice , which was soft and sweet , expressive of gentleness and good nature , caught his ear the moment she spoke .
" Though I am blind ," said the harper , " I can hear , you know , and I heard from your sister herself all that I told you of her , that she was good - tempered and good - natured and fond of you ."
And when you said you did not like the tune she liked best , she was not angry with you , but said , ' Then play William ' s first , if you please ,'-- was not that good - tempered ?"
" That is such a difficult question ," said the harper , " that I must take time to consider ."
Well , play us a tune , if you can play ever a good one -- play me -- let ' s see , what shall he play , Bob ?"
" Bumper Squire Jones ."
All who were younger and weaker than himself , dreaded his approach , and detested him as a tyrant .
The children readily produced their halfpence , and thought their wealth well bestowed upon this poor , good - natured man , who had taken so much pains to entertain them , better even than upon the gingerbread woman , whose stall they loved to frequent .
" God bless you , sir ," said the lad ; but as he took the shilling which the young gentleman had slily put INTO THE BLIND MAN ' S HAND , he saw that it was not worth one farthing .
" That ' s your affair ," said the brutal boy , pushing away his hand .
" You may pass it , you know , as well as I do , if you look sharp .
You have taken it from me , and I shan ' t take it back again , I promise you ."
Then to Susan , to screen himself from manifest danger , for the attorney ' s son looked upon him with a vengeful mien , " But here ' s Susan here , who understands silver a great deal better than I do ; she takes a power of it for bread , you know ."
Good - bye ."
" Miss Somers , I am afraid , will be waiting for us ," said Susan .
" You know she said she would call at six ; and by the length of our shadows I ' m sure it is late ."
" Come in , Susan ; we thought you had quite forsaken us ," said Miss Somers to Susan , who advanced timidly .
" Because as how ," continued John , " she was loth to refuse us the hearing a blind man play on the harp .
" Now , Susan , choose yourself a gown ," said Miss Somers ; " you set an example of industry and good conduct , of which we wish to take public notice , for the benefit of others ."
The shopkeeper , who was father to Susan ' s friend Rose , looked much satisfied by this speech , and as if a compliment had been paid to himself , bowed low to Miss Somers , and then with alertness , which a London linen - draper might have admired , produced piece after piece of his best goods to his young customer -- unrolled , unfolded , held the bright stuffs and calendered calicoes in various lights .
Her sister observed , that Susan looked as if her thoughts were far distant from gowns .
" BUT what , Susan ?"
Susan hesitated .
Put this shining yellow counter ," continued she , pointing to the guinea , " in your pocket , and make what use of it you please .
Susan curtsied , with an expressive look of gratitude , and with a modest frankness in her countenance , which seemed to say , " I would tell you , and welcome , what I want to do with the guinea ; but I am not used to speak before so many people .
" No later back , ma ' am , than last May morning ," said he , " as my daughter Rose was telling us , Susan did a turn , in her quiet way , by her mother , that would not displease you if you were to hear it .
You will , I hope , find us good customers and well - wishers ," added she , with a smile ; " for those who wish well to their neighbours surely deserve to have well - wishers themselves ."
A few words may encourage the benevolent passions , and may dispose people to live in peace and happiness ; a few words may set them at variance , and may lead to misery and lawsuits .
Susan saw her lamb by the water - side .
The butcher was feeling whether the lamb was fat .
The butcher did not answer , but the attorney replied , " It is not your sister ' s lamb any longer ; it ' s mine -- mine to all intents and purposes ."
cried the children , with terror ; " and will you kill it ?"
" I have no time to waste ," said he ; " butcher , you ' ll account with me .
And he walked off , deaf to the prayers of the poor children .
As soon as the attorney was out of sight , Susan rose from the bank where she was seated , came up to her lamb , and stooped to gather some of the fresh dewy trefoil , to let it eat out of her hand for the last time .
" Now , let us go ," said Susan .
Susan thanked him , but walked away quickly , without looking again at her lamb .
The butcher had choice , tender lamb , he said , fit to eat the next day ; and as Mr . Case was impatient to make his offering to Sir Arthur , he accepted the butcher ' s proposal , though with such seeming reluctance , that he actually squeezed out of him , before he would complete the bargain , a bribe of a fine sweetbread .
The neighbours were kind enough to show me whereabouts you lived ; for , though I didn ' t know your name , they guessed who I meant by what I said of you all ."
Could you be so charitable as to give an old blind man a night ' s lodging ?"
Susan said she would step in and ask her mother ; and she soon returned with an answer , that he was heartily welcome , if he could sleep upon the children ' s bed , which was but small .
As she spoke , she threw her arms round her father , who pressed her to his bosom without speaking , for his heart was full .
He was some little time before he could perfectly believe that what he heard was true ; but the revived smiles of his wife , the noisy joy of his little boys , and the satisfaction that shone in Susan ' s countenance , convinced him that he was not in a dream .
" Honestly and handsomely , that I ' m sure of beforehand ," said her proud mother ; " but how I can ' t make out , except by the baking .
Have we not a right to be proud of our Susan ?
But speak on , child -- first bringing us a bottle of the good mead you made last year from your own honey ."
There was to be a splendid ball given upon the occasion at Shrewsbury , which was about five miles from our village .
" There ," cried Bab , " _I_ and PAPA are to dine and drink tea at The Abbey tomorrow .
" Then pray , Betty ," continued Miss Barbara , " don ' t forget to - morrow , the first thing you do , to send off to Shrewsbury for my new bonnet .
I can see , you know , something of the fashions to - morrow at the Abbey .
Some time ago we had fine guinea - fowls of our own , and I made bold , not thinking , to be sure , that all our own would die away from us , as they have done , to give a fine couple last Christmas to Susan Price , and very fond and pleased she was at the time , and I ' m sure would never have parted with the hen with her good - will ; but if my eyes don ' t strangely mistake , this hen , that comes from Miss Barbara , is the selfsame identical guinea - hen that I gave to Susan .
He had a dexterous knack of twisting the conversation to his point .
Some joints , he observed , were much more difficult to carve than others .
Sir Arthur , pray may I ask , when you carve a forequarter of lamb , do you , when you raise the shoulder , throw in salt , or not ?"
The attorney was thanked for his intended present ; but mortified and surprised to hear Sir Arthur say that it was a constant rule of his never to accept of any presents from his neighbours .
" I know so much about it ,-- about the ball I mean ," said she , " because a lady in Shrewsbury , a friend of papa ' s , offered to take me with her ; but papa did not like to give her the trouble of sending so far for me , though she has a coach of her own ."
" What is the matter , Philip ?"
So the guinea - hen was delivered to Philip , who set off joyfully with his prize , and was soon in sight of Farmer Price ' s cottage .
He stopped when he came to the door .
He was determined that she should have the pleasure of restoring the guinea - hen .
and there was a universal shout of joy .
I ' d have taken it back sooner , but I was off before day to the fair , and am but just come back .
Daisy , however , has been as well off in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside ."
When she heard the sound of the music , she put down her work and listened .
Thank you , thank you all ," added she , to her companions , who sympathized in her joy , even more than they had sympathized in her sorrow .
The crowd moved away in consequence of Philip ' s considerate advice : but it was observed that he was the very last to stir from the garden - wicket himself .
Rose held the sieve , and Susan was feeding her long lost favourite , whilst Philip leaned over the wicket , prolonging his narration .
This message led to another quarter of an hour ' s delay ; for he had the whole history of the guinea - hen to tell over again to Mrs . Price , and the farmer himself luckily came in whilst it was going on , so it was but civil to begin it afresh ; and then the farmer was so rejoiced to see his Susan so happy again with her two little favourites that he declared he must see Daisy fed himself ; and Philip found that he was wanted to hold the jug full of milk , out of which Farmer Price filled the pan for Daisy ?
Yes or no !
Will you give it me or not ?
The bees swarmed about her .
Betty instantly began to tell the story of Barbara ' s mishap her own way .
Couldn ' t you be content , without seizing upon the honey - comb by force ?
Six ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges of the performance .
The Miss Somerses , who were fond of music , were amongst the ladies in the semicircle ; and the prize was lodged in the hands of Sir Arthur .
The first harp sounded , and as each musician tried his skill , the audience seemed to think that each deserved the prize .
Who can think of writing to me , in this world ?"
Farmer Price sat down in his own chair , for he could not read entirely to his satisfaction in any other , and read as follows :--
But it is my humour to go about as I do .
Susan now , by her father ' s desire , opened the ballad .
They came with an intention , which they were much disappointed to find that the old harper had rendered vain -- they came to lend the farmer and his good family the money to pay for his substitute .
Mr . Price , will you come out with me , and let me show you a piece of your land , through which I want to make a road .
I would not speak to you about it whilst we were bargaining about your land , lest I should over - awe you ; but , tell me , what is this flaw ?"
" However , I can show you , Sir Arthur , just for my own satisfaction and yours , a few lines of a memorandum on a slip of paper , which was given me by your relation , the gentleman who lived here before , and let me my farm .
You ' ll see , by that bit of paper , what was meant ; but the attorney says , the paper ' s not worth a button in a court of justice , and I don ' t understand these things .
" It is not far off , is it ?"
When they got to the ground , Mr . Case , who saw them walking together , was in a hurry to join them , that he might put a stop to any explanations .
Explanations were things of which he had a great dread ; but , fortunately , he was upon this occasion a little too late .
" Yes ; this is the whole thing ," said Price .
" I thought it my duty to do so ; not out of any malice or ill - will to this good man ."
In both cases I shall be guided by memoranda which I have in my possession .
" You are a scholar ; you write a good hand ; you can keep accounts , cannot you ?"
I want no agent to squeeze my tenants , or do my dirty work .
" And what are my sisters about here ?"
Joy , I think , has made me quite well ."
" Yes ," said Sir Arthur , " and I hope on that day , Susan , you will be very happy with your little friends upon their play - green .
I shall tell them that it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them ; and if you have anything to ask , any little favour for any of your companions , which we can grant , now ask , Susan .
Fare ye well ."
How happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family , silent with gratitude , who will bless them aloud when they are far out of hearing !
" How do I wish , now ," said Farmer Price , " and it ' s almost a sin for one that has had such a power of favours done him , to wish for anything more ; but how I DO wish , wife , that our good friend , the harper was only here at this time .
Where is it ?
" But I will not leave it to him , I assure you ," cried Mr . Somerville ; " I never made any such promise .
" Ha !
O stay !
" I broke your window with this ball ; but I did not know that I had done it , till this moment , I assure you , or I should have told you before .
How happened it that you could break my windows without knowing it ?
Upon this piece of waste ground the children of the village often used to play .
Amongst these he one evening met with a little book full of the history of birds and beasts ; he looked immediately to see whether the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds , and , to his great joy , he found a full description and history of his favourite bird .
Mr . O ' Neill , in hopes of pleasing his son rather than in the expectation of having his fortune made , immediately sat down to listen ; and his son explained to him , that he had found in his book an account of pigeons who carried notes and letters : " and , father ," continued Brian , " I find my pigeon is of this sort ; and I intend to make my pigeon carry messages .
Hey , father ?"
Nothing can be more shortsighted than cunning .
They endeavoured to teach the pigeon , which they had stolen , to carry messages for them in a part of the country at some distance from Somerville ; and when they fancied that it had forgotten its former habits , and its old master , they thought that they might venture to employ him nearer home .
The carpenter had just put up a sign , which was covered over with a bit of carpeting .
said Mr . Somerville to Brian , " and pull that sign straight , for it hangs quite crooked .
But you never remember about birthdays , mamma .
" What do you mean my dear ?
" And can Bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day ?"
There is to be a wreath of myrtle , you know , round the handle , and a frost ground , and then the medallions --"
" Stay ," interrupted her sister , for Rosamond , anticipating the glories of her work - basket , talked and walked so fast that she had passed , without perceiving it , the shop where the filigree - paper was to be bought .
" I must go to my mother , sir ," said the child ; " besides , you have spoiled all my lace .
" Can ' t you ?"
said Laura , holding up her half - guinea .
" Oh , no ."
Late on the morning of her cousin ' s birthday , Rosamond finished her work - basket .
sir !
" Then you think Bell is sillier now than you were two years ago ,-- well , perhaps that is true ; but how comes it , Rosamond , now that you are so wise , that you are fond of such a silly person ?"
" _I_ , father ?"
" Yes , and all my half guinea besides ."
Rosamond looked down upon the basket , and was silent .
Everybody in the house tried to please her , and they succeeded so well , that between breakfast and dinner she had only six fits of crying .
" Yes , but mistress was disappointed about the lace ; it is not come home ."
The lace , however , could not be had ; and Bell at length submitted to let the frock be put on .
" Nay , tell me , though , and I ' ll never tell -- if I AM asked ."
She snatched the basket the moment it was within her reach .
But now you have brought it , let us look at it !"
The little girl gave the lace without reply , and the maid desired her to go about her business , and not to expect to be paid ; for that her mistress could not see anybody , BECAUSE she was in a room full of company .
I believe you ' d call , call , call twenty times for twopence ."
However ungraciously the permission to call again was granted , it was received with gratitude .
Laura received this declaration in silence -- Rosamond smiled ; and at her smile the ill - suppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the seventh and loudest fit of crying which had yet been heard on her birthday .
" No , not Nancy , but THEM , mamma ," said Bell , pointing to Laura and Rosamond .
don ' t POINT ," said her mother , putting down her stubborn finger ; " nor say THEM , like Nancy ; I am sure you misunderstood .
" Oh , no , indeed !"
They succeeded so well , that in about a quarter of an hour the young lady ' s eyes , and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural colour ; and the business being thus happily hushed up , the mother , as a reward to her daughter for her good humour , begged that Rosamond would now be so good as to produce her " charming present ."
The doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony , and the filigree basket appeared in all its glory .
" Well , this is a charming present , indeed !"
the basket fell to the ground , and only the handle remained in her hand .
" Nor Miss Bell , neither , ma ' am ,-- I can answer for her ; for she never knew of its being there , because I never so much as mentioned it to her , that there was such a thing in the house , because I knew Miss Rosamond wanted to surprise her with the secret ; so I never mentioned a sentence of it -- did I , Miss Bell ?"
cried Bell , turning angrily ; " I ' m not afraid of anything ,-- I ' ve nothing to be afraid about ."
Nancy !
I assure you I am very angry about it , Rosamond ."
I ' m sure she must have been meddling with it ," added the maid .
" Oh , yes , that ' s the thing ," said the mistress , decidedly .
" Well , Miss Rosamond , for your comfort she shall never come into my house again ."
" Call her in ," said the lady of the house ; " let us see her directly ."
The maid , who was afraid that the girl ' s innocence would appear if she were produced , hesitated ; but upon her mistress repeating her commands , she was forced to obey .
Did you ever see that basket before ?"
" YES , MA ' AM !"
The maid , frightened , pulled the little girl by the sleeve .
" Well , and what became of it afterwards ?"
Bell !
You know I prophesied that your half - guinea would be gone the soonest .
said she , appealing , in a sarcastic tone , to where she thought Laura was .
But low as the voice of Laura was , the poor little lace - girl heard it ; and now , for the first time , fixing her eyes upon Laura , recollected her benefactress .
RESPECT is not an improper word , even applied to a child of Laura ' s age ; for let the age or situation of the person be what it may , they command respect who deserve it .

Now this custom we know to have been entered on the register of the Royal Abbey of Bec , in Normandy , as one belonging to the Manor of East or Great Wrotham , in Norfolk , given by Ralph de Toni to the Abbey of Bec , and was as follows :-- When the harvest was finished the tenants were to have half an acre of barley , and a ram let loose ; and if they caught him he was their own to make merry with ; but if he escaped from them he was the Lord ' s .
The Etonians , in order to secure the ram , houghed him in the Irish fashion , and then attacked him with great clubs .

Quizzed him , quizzed him !
quizzed him indeed , with all his cleverness ; that was famously done .
But what need have you to want him out of your way , now Lord John has come over to your side ?
" Please your Majesty ," you should say .
Patty .
It strayed away from the rest ; and I should have lost him , so I should , for ever , if it had not been for a good young gentleman .
Pretty creature -- or , your Majesty , whichever you choose to be called -- come and dance with them , and I ' ll carry your lamb .
Farmer .
This is fun , this is quizzing ; but you don ' t know what we young gentlemen mean by quizzing .
Where was I ?
Mounted upon a fine bay hunter .
" Here , YOU ," says he , meaning me --" open this gate for me ."
cries my jackanapes , and off he gallops him , through the very thick of my corn ; but he got a fall , leaping the ditch out yonder , which pacified me , like , at the minute .
( aside ).
Ay , that I will , with a deal of pleasure ; for you be a civil spoken young gentleman ; and , besides , I don ' t think the worse on you for being FRIGHTED a little about your mother ; being what I might ha ' been , at your age , myself ; for I had a mother myself once .

" One self - approving hour whole years outweighs , Of stupid starers and of loud huzzas ."
where is it ?"
" Well , I ' m glad of it ," replied the rough faced man , who was the captain of a ship .
" Stay !
" I am really very much obliged to you , my little fellow ," said he .
said he to Maurice .
Maurice thanked the gentleman , and returned home , eager to show his precious tulip - roots to his father , and to a companion of his , the son of a nurseryman , who lived near him .
I have good news for you -- something you ' ll be delighted to see , Arthur !-- Ha !-- but here is something that I am not delighted to see , I am sure ," said poor Maurice , who , when he had got through the raspberry - bushes , and had come in sight of his own garden , beheld his bell - glass -- his beloved bell - glass , under which his cucumbers were grown so finely -- his only bell - glass , broken to pieces !
" I was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall , and by accident a great lump of couch - grass , with stones hanging to the roots , fell upon your bell - glass , and broke it , as you see ."
" Oh , forgive and forget , as my father always says ; that ' s the best way .
He never took pleasure in looking at my garden , or at anything that I did that was well done ; and he never gave me a share of anything that he had ; and so I did not like him ; how could I ?
He was not very rich , but he was proud ; and his favourite proverb was , " Better live in spite than in pity ."
When first he settled near Mr . Grant , the gardener , he felt inclined to dislike him , because he was told that Mr . Grant was a Scotchman , and he had a prejudice against Scotchmen ; all of whom he believed to be cunning and avaricious , because he had once been over - reached by a Scotch peddler .
The fruit was so large , as to be quite a curiosity .
Mr . Grant hastily shut his book , but remarked , with a shrewd glance at his son , that it was in that book he found his Brobdingnag raspberries .
" With Maurice Grant , I say ; I forbid you from this day and hour forward to have anything to do with him ."
There was in Grant ' s garden a plum - tree , which was planted close to the loose stone wall that divided the garden from the nursery .
The plum - tree does me little or no damage , but I don ' t like to be imposed upon by a Scotchman ."
Arthur interrupted his father ' s reverie , by pointing to a book and some young plants which lay upon the wall .
It contained these words :
* It is necessary to observe that this experiment has never been actually tried upon raspberry - plants .
"' When I read in this book what is said about the strawberries growing as large as apricots , after they had been covered over with seaweed , I thought that perhaps seaweed ashes might be good for my father ' s raspberries ; and I asked him if he would give me leave to try them .
Pray , Arthur , do you know whether your friend Maurice was born in England or in Scotland ?"
was the father ' s inquiry .
Why , this is the most cunning letter I ever read ."
I mean nothing but what ' s honest .
Maurice had put his tulip , which was beginning to blow , in a flower - pot , on the top of the wall , in hopes that his friend Arthur would see it from day to day .
Arthur , who was full of the thought of convincing his father that the attorney was mistaken in his judgment of poor Maurice , did not observe the fall of the tulip .
This temper of mind Maurice was more happy in enjoying than he could have been made , without it , by the possession of all the tulips in Holland .
He turned , looked about him , and saw his friend Maurice .
cried Arthur and Mr . Oakly at once .
" Offer them to the father -- offer them to Mr . Grant ," whispered Oakly ; " he ' ll take them , I ' ll answer for it ."
He repeated exactly the answer which he really sent , and Oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him , saying " I believe you : no more need be said .
There was no holding out against his good nature .
WASTE NOT , WANT NOT ; or TWO STRINGS TO YOUR BOW .
Mr . Gresham , a Bristol merchant , who had , by honourable industry and economy , accumulated a considerable fortune , retired from business to a new house which he had built upon the Downs , near Clifton .
The morning after these two boys arrived at their uncle ' s they were eager to see all the rooms in the house .
Some time afterwards , he heard their voices in the hall .
Hal stood still , exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his hands , and tried first at one corner , and then at another , to pull the string off by force .
so here it goes ," cried Hal , drawing out his knife ; and he cut the cord , precipitately , in sundry places .
said Mr . Gresham , opening the parlour door as he spoke .
" You may keep the string for your pains ," said Mr . Gresham .
" No , I am afraid not , if this be it ," said his uncle , taking up the jagged knotted remains of Hal ' s cord .
" But then ," said Ben , " what will you do for a hat - band ?"
He had scarcely played half an hour before he split it , by driving the peg too violently .
He was in a prodigious hurry when these young gentlemen knocked at his uncle ' s door the next day ; but just as he got to the hall door , little Patty called to him from the top of the stairs , and told him that he had dropped his pocket - handkerchief .
" I shall not think you one bit less manly , because I see you playing at cat ' s cradle with a little child of six years old ."
Hal , however , was not precisely of his uncle ' s opinion : for when he returned in the evening , and saw Ben playing with his little cousin , he could not help smiling contemptuously , and asked if he had been playing at cat ' s cradle all night .
" Do you know , uncle -- do you know , Ben ," said he --" there ' s to be the most FAMOUS doings that ever were heard of upon the Downs here , the first day of next month , which will be in a fortnight , thank my stars !
" Very likely ," said Mr . Gresham , soberly ; " but what then ?"
cried Hal , " but you shall hear .
" I don ' t pretend to understand these things ," added he , with an air of simplicity ; " but we will inquire , Ben , into the necessity of the case ; and if it is necessary -- or , if you think it necessary , that you shall have a uniform -- why , I ' ll give you one ."
" Take care how you do that ," said Mr . Gresham : " for perhaps the lady was not mistaken ."
I know a gentleman whose sons are to be at this archery meeting , and we will inquire into all the particulars from him .
The gentleman upon whom Mr . Gresham called had three sons , who were all to be at this archery meeting ; and they unanimously assured him , in the presence of Hal and Ben , that they had never thought of buying uniforms for this grand occasion , and that , amongst the number of their acquaintance , they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at such an UNNECESSARY expense .
All that can be done , my dear boys , in these difficult cases , is to judge for yourselves , which opinions , and which people , are the most reasonable ."
" Your having halfpence in your pocket is an excellent reason for eating ," said Mr . Gresham , smiling .
His uncle , who was desirous to see his nephews act without restraint , that he might judge their characters , bid them do as they pleased .
" Come , then , Ben , if you ' ve any halfpence in your pocket ."
" I suppose THAT means that you ' ve no halfpence ," said Hal , laughing , with the look of superiority which he had been taught to think the RICH might assume towards those who were convicted either of poverty or economy .
Hal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin ; but they thanked him , and refused to eat any , because , they said , they were not hungry ; so he ate and ate as he walked along , till at last he stopped , and said , " This bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes , I can ' t bear it !"
" Well , there is the cake for you .
" Hark !"
" I ' ve a bit of bun here ," cried Ben , joyfully , producing the remains of the bun which Hal but an hour before would have thrown away .
Ben asked what ACCIDENT he meant ; and the lad told him that , but a few weeks ago , he had lost the sight of his eye by the stroke of a stone , which reached him as he was passing under the rocks at Clifton unluckily when the workmen were blasting .
" Hard by , sir , just close to the church here : it was HER that always had the showing of it to strangers , till she lost the use of her poor limbs ."
" Shall we , may we , uncle , go that way ?
said Hal , sighing ; " I did not know there were such shocking places in the world .
Hal , after he was again seated in the hackney - coach , and had rattled through the busy streets of Bristol , for a few minutes quite forgot the spectacle of misery which he had seen ; and the gay shops in Wine Street and the idea of his green and white uniform wholly occupied his imagination .
I ' m very much obliged to you ; but I would rather not have one .
His uncle took up a pen , and calculated for a few minutes ; then , showing the back of the letter , upon which he was writing , to his nephews , " Cast up these sums , boys ," said he , " and tell me whether I am right ."
" Ben , do you do it ," said Hal , a little embarrassed ; " I am not quick at figures ."
" Yes , sir , quite right ."
" Oh , sir ," said Hal , with an alarmed look ; " but it is not winter YET ; it is not cold weather YET .
said Hal , sighing , as he looked at the epaulettes , " uncle , if you would not be displeased , if I choose the uniform --"
The measure of Hal ' s happiness was now complete .
" What next , my boy ?"
" No , uncle , you only said a bow ."
It is better to claim less than more than what is promised .
" Stay , stay !
I remember you said there are to be famous doings , the first of September , upon the Downs .
Patty laughed , and said , " This does not explain it to me ."
Everybody but little children , I suppose , understands it ; but there ' s no explaining THOSE SORT of words , if you don ' t TAKE THEM at once .
Give me my bow , for I must go out upon the Downs and practise ."
was the first question that was asked by Hal and Ben the moment that they wakened .
said he , in a voice of exultation , when he entered the breakfast - room .
" Now , is it not very extraordinary ," said Hal to himself , " that they should go on so long talking about an old pair of gloves , without saying scarcely a word about my new uniform ?
said Hal to his uncle .
" Show him up , show him up ," said Mr . Gresham .
The boy bowed , without any cringing servility , but with an open , decent freedom in his manner , which expressed that he had been obliged , but that he knew his young benefactor was not thinking of the obligation .
I cut the cork round for the inside myself , which was all I could do ."
I am not sure I ' m right , sir ; for both the young gentlemen spoke at once , and the wind is very high at the street door ; so that I could not well make out all they said ; but I believe this is the sense of it ."
I know that is just what was settled the day I dined at Lady Diana ' s ; and Lady Diana and a great party of gentlemen are to ride --"
The public walk leading to the Wells was full of company .
A barge , with coloured streamers flying , was waiting to take up a party who were going upon the water .
" Fall back , my good friend -- fall back ," said the military lady , as soon as he had delivered the bow to Hal ; " I mean , stand out of the way , for your great patch cuts no figure amongst us .
Hal stepped proudly , and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon his epaulettes , or upon the facings of his uniform ; whilst all the time he was considered only as part of a show .
As he stopped to pick it up , he let go his hat , which he had hitherto held on with anxious care ; for the hat , though it had a fine green and white cockade , had no band or string round it .
The hat was too large for his head without this band ; a sudden gust of wind blew it off .
the moment he set his foot upon it the foot sank .
His companions , who had halted upon the top of the hill , stood laughing , spectators of his misfortune .
He dragged poor Hal , who was a deplorable spectacle , out of the red mud .
The obliging mistress of a lodging house , as soon as she understood that the young gentleman was nephew to Mr . Gresham , to whom she had formerly let her house , received Hal , covered as he was with dirt .
Lady Diana also seemed more to enjoy than to pity his confusion .
" My hands are benumbed ; I can scarcely feel ," said he , rubbing them , and blowing upon the ends of his fingers .
" If I have any luck --" said he .
" There , it ' s all over with you !"
His second was exactly as near as Hal ' s first .
" The everlasting whip cord , I declare !"
Master Sweepstakes , with anxiety , examined the hit .
Ben was victorious !
I tell you my master is not up .
Lucy .
Oh , then , don ' t send him away -- don ' t send him away .
( Aloud .)
My father will see you soon ; pray sit down .
Lucy .
( He sits down .)
I ' m afraid this poor myrtle is quite dead -- quite dead .
( Aloud .)
Lucy .
Old M . Why , miss -- but I won ' t trouble you about it .
Hark !
You may tell me your story as we go along .
( He tastes his chocolate .)
Lucy .
Oh , but , papa , I assure you I put in two lumps myself .
I tell you what , I ' ve been plagued ever since I was awake , and before I was awake , about that old man .
Lucy .
Just .
Oh , this foot of mine !--( twinges )-- Oh , this foot !
Enter WILLIAM .
Will .
Just .
Yes , sir , and I hear her voice below now .
Land .
Just .
Will you take a glass of anything this morning , Mrs .
Just .
Well , and to be sure so it was , remarkably good time for your worship ; but folks in our way must be up betimes , you know .
Enter William , to take away the chocolate .
a sort of a travelling man .
And show the old man in now .
( The Landlady looks eagerly towards the door , as it opens , and exclaims ,)
What is this ?
( waves his hand with dignity ).
silence !
Come forward , sir , and let me hear what you have to say .
Land .
Ay , do , do , papa , speak for him .
Land .
Mrs . Bustle , I have desired silence , and I will have it , that ' s poz !
I have lived upon charity , and I scraped together a guinea and a half and upwards , and I was travelling with it to my grandson , in the north , with him to end my days -- but ( sighing )--
Lucy .
Thank me !
for what , sir ?
You lost your money , hey , at the " Saracen ' s Head "?
Pray , my good friend , where might you put your money when you went to bed ?
hum !-- and you say the box and all were gone in the morning ?
Old M . No , please your worship , no ; not the box -- the box was never stirred from the place where I put it .
It ' s well you are not upon oath .
Just .
Yes , yes , yes , child -- nonsense !
it ' s all a lie from beginning to end .
I ' ve said it , I ' ve said it , and that ' s enough to convince me , and I ' ll tell you more ; if my Lord Chief Justice of England told it to me , I would not believe it -- that ' s poz !
Old M . Impose !
Just .
One hour I ' ll give you to recollect yourself , and if you don ' t give up this idle story , I ' ll -- I ' ll commit you as a vagrant -- that ' s poz !
Go , go , for the present .
IF I tell the truth -- oh !
Here , William ( showing the committal ), take this old gentleman to Holdfast , the constable , and give him this warrant .
Enter Lucy , running , out of breath .
Oh la !
your worship , did you ever hear the like ?
Ay , your worship , my old magpie .
Miss was very clever ; it was she caught the thief .
Miss was very clever .
Oh !
then first I must tell you how I came to suspect Mr . Magpie .
Do you remember , papa , that day last summer , when I went with you to the bowling - green , at the " Saracen ' s Head "?
Land .
but I ask pardon , miss .
Lucy .
Just .
ha !
Ay , and I fear I was , too ; but when one is touched about the credit of one ' s house , one ' s apt to speak warmly .
You are all convinced that I told you no lies .
Miss , you have made me the happiest man alive !
( eagerly ).
Mr . and Mrs . Montague spent the summer of the year 1795 at Clifton with their son Frederick , and their two daughters Sophia and Marianne .
On the stairs , in the passages , at her window , she was continually visible ; and she appeared to possess the art of being present in all these places at once .
Her voice was eternally to be heard , and it was not particularly melodious .
The very first day she met Mrs . Montague ' s children on the stairs , she stopped to tell Marianne that she was a charming dear , and a charming little dear ; to kiss her , to inquire her name , and to inform her that her own name was " Mrs . Theresa Tattle ," a circumstance of which there was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance ; for , in the course of one morning , at least twenty single and as many double raps at the door were succeeded by vociferations of " Mrs . Theresa Tattle ' s servant !"
" Mrs . Theresa Tattle at home ?"
She was about thirteen -- that dangerous age at which ill educated girls , in their anxiety to display their accomplishments , are apt to become dependent for applause upon the praise of every idle visitor ; when the habits not being formed , and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and manners , girls are apt to affect and imitate , indiscriminately , everything that they conceive to be agreeable .
" Mrs . Theresa Tattle presents her very best compliments to the entertaining Mr . Frederick Montague ; she hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening , and bring his charming sister , Miss Marianne , with him , as Mrs . Theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache , and is sensible her nerves are affected ; and Dr . Cardamum says that ( especially in Mrs . T . T .' s case ) it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an instant .
cried Marianne , " she ' s so good - humoured , don ' t tease her any more , and don ' t draw heads upon her paper , and don ' t stretch her india - rubber , and don ' t let us dirty any more of her brushes .
" Mrs . Theresa Tattle might say so ," replied Sophy , calmly ; " but I do not perceive the reason , brother , why drawing should prevent me from learning how to make a pudding ."
indeed !
When mamma took me down to see the cook make a cake once , I saw her spoonfuls , and her ounces , and her handfuls : she dashed and splashed without minding exactness or the recipe , or anything .
The servant opened the door wider , to let him pass , and Marianne thought she must follow her brother : so they went downstairs together , while Sophy gave her own message to the servant , and quietly stayed at her usual occupations .
Mrs . Tattle was seated at her tea - table , with a large plate of macaroons beside her when Frederick and Marianne entered .
Carbuncle ."
Now , my dear , what shall I help you to ?
she never calls him my dear , you know , but always Doctor .
eat !
Mar .
Here ' s eels , sir ; let me help you to some eel -- stewed eel ;-- you used to be fond of stewed eel .
You would tire one of anything .
Mar .
It ' s really very extraordinary , Mrs . Carbuncle !
And why not have glass covers , that one may see one ' s dinner before one , before it grows cold with asking questions , Mrs . Carbuncle , and lifting up covers ?
Mar .
" Mr . Frederick , you ' ll make me die with laughing !
Carbuncle ."
Here ; a plate , knife and fork , bit o ' bread , a glass of Dorchester ale !
" Brother ," said Marianne , " now sing an Italian song for us like Miss Croker .
I ' ve never sung once , except for very particular people , this winter ."
Mar .
I ' m sure you ' ll sing for her .
Oh , try , Miss Croker , for once .
exclaimed Mrs . Tattle ; " so like Miss Croker , I ' m sure I shall think of you , Mr . Frederick , when I hear her asked to sing again .
It ' s not late ."
That is Sir Charles to the very life .
Frederick ."
" Cry !
bless me ," said Mrs . Theresa , " mighty odd !
" But , Sophy !
" Oh !
Christopher !"
It was so dark , that their forms could scarcely be discerned .
what are ye ?"
The chimney - sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed , thanked her ladyship for this information , said , " Good night to ye , quality "; and they both moved towards the door .
So he screeched , and screeched , all he could ; and by the greatest chance in life , ma ' am , old Mr . Eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk ."
Go on , Christopher .
So the sweep did make him hear ."
but he ' s alive now ; go on with your story , Christopher ," said Mrs . T . " Chimney - sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day ; it ' s part of their trade , and it ' s a happy thing when they come off with a few bruises .
" Certainly it was a most commendable action , and quite providential .
This is excellent !
CHAPTER III .
" Oh , ma ' am ," said Frederick , " I cannot promise you any such thing , indeed .
" If they do come home , I will ask them about it ," said Frederick , hesitating ; for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation , he had not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying No .
no , ma ' am ," said Frederick ; " but I said I would .
" Papa and mamma , you know , just as they were going away , said , ' If Mrs . Theresa asks you to come , do as you think best '"
" Well , then ," said Mrs . Theresa , " you know it rests with yourselves , if you may do as you please ."
You that have such talents to show .
He is the best character , the oddest creature !
Now you , who have so much invention and cleverness -- I have no invention myself ; but could you not hit upon some way of seeing him , so that you might get him by heart ?
" Well , well , let us hear it ; and you shall do as you please afterwards .
I give you infinite credit for it !"
" Christopher , shut the door .
" No , ma ' am ."
Christopher , who had curiosity , as well as his mistress , when he returned with the chimney - sweeper , prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping the hearth , throwing down the tongs and shovel , and picking them up again .
" That will do , Christopher !
I don ' t think that would be quite right ."
" I hope Frederick won ' t go up to disturb her ."
" Nay , Miss Marianne , I don ' t commend you now .
I won ' t detain you .
" Bleeding !
Gracious me !
he ' ll bleed to death , I believe ."
cried Marianne , catching hold of the words ; and terrified , she ran upstairs , crying , " Sophy , oh , Sophy !
My brother ' s bleeding to death !
Sophy !
" Gracious me !
I ' m glad to hear him speak like himself again , at anyrate ," cried Mrs . Theresa .
cried Mrs . Theresa , catching hold of her gown to stop her , as she came near Frederick .
" Oh , Miss Eden , your beautiful India muslin !
But she pressed forward .
cried Marianne , throwing her arms round her , and looking up as if to a being of a superior order .
" No , my love !"
" I ' ve done bleeding ," said Frederick .
" Dear me , Miss Marianne , if you would not make such a rout ," cried Mrs . Tattle .
You see he ' s stopped bleeding .
Let me speak ," cried he , pushing away her hand , which stopped his mouth .
The rest you saw .
I hope for the future I shall behave like a gentleman ."
It was Mr . and Mrs . Montague .
" What will you do now ?"
" A chimney - sweeper covered with blood !"
He will want to go home ," said Mr . Eden , turning to Mrs . Theresa .
" The mother of mischief ," says an old proverb , " is no bigger than a midge ' s wing ."
Till Archer came , the ideas of FAVOURITES and PARTIES were almost unknown at Dr . Middleton ' s ; but he brought all these ideas fresh from a great public school , at which he had been educated -- at which he had acquired a sufficient quantity of Greek and Latin , and a superabundant quantity of party spirit .
It may seem surprising , that a GREAT DUNCE should be able to work upon a boy like an Archer , who was called a great genius ; but when genius is joined to a violent temper , instead of being united to good sense , it is at the mercy even of dunces .
Fisher betted on Archer ' s head , who had not sense enough to despise the bet of a blockhead .
Fisher applauded this as a very spirited speech ; and , by insinuations that Dr . Middleton " always gave the premium to De Grey ," and that " those who had lost their bets might thank themselves for it , for being such simpletons as to bet against the favourite ," he raised a murmur highly flattering to Archer , amongst some of the most credulous boys ; whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr . Middleton ' s impartiality .
These warmly congratulated De Grey .
" And is THIS your famous playhouse ?"
These words made a great and visible change in the feelings and opinions of the public .
" Who would be a servant of the public ?
They gathered round Archer to hear the description of his playhouse , and at every sentence insulting comparisons were made .
" My friends , I see you are discontented with me and my playhouse .
Archer , who was touched by what his rival said , and , stopping the hand of his new partisan , Fisher , cried , " No , Fisher !
" I said I could bear to see all this , and I can ," said he ; " now it is all over ."
And now it was all over , there was silence .
" Want !-- nothing -- with YOU ," said the old woman ; " do you want nothing with ME ?"
" I -- what do I want ?"
In that WATCH - CHAIN , she should have said , for her quick eye had espied Archer ' s watch - chain .
And happier he who had a shilling , for he was in the high road to be one day upon the woolsack , Lord High Chancellor of England .
Fisher , who like all weak people was extremely credulous , kept his post immovable in the front row all the time , his mouth open , and his stupid eyes fixed upon the gipsy , in whom he felt implicit faith .
" Put it , then ," said Archer , " what hinders you ?"
" _I_ shall not hear you ," said De Grey , " I am going ."
" What is become of my Livy ?"
said the gipsy .
" It had a leaf torn out in the beginning , and I HATE DR . MIDDLETON --"
" Right -- the very book !"
" But never think to deceive me ," said she , shaking her head at him in a manner that made him tremble .
I lost it a week ago ."
" Meet me here at this hour to - morrow evening , and I will answer you .
I must be gone .
" Am I your manager , or not ?"
was now his question .
Some of the youngest of his employers had , it is true , at times complained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their accounts ; but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial , Fisher ' s character and consequence were undiminished , till the fatal day when his Aunt Barbara forbade his visits to the confectioner ' s ; or , rather , till she requested the confectioner , who had his private reasons for obeying her , not TO RECEIVE her nephew ' s visits , as he had made himself sick at his house , and Mrs . Barbara ' s fears for his health were incessant .
Since his father ' s death Fisher had become a boarder at Dr . Middleton ' s , but his frequent visits to his Aunt Barbara afforded him opportunities of going into the town .
Archer , impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity , gave his plan and his orders in a few minutes , in a most decided manner ; " These things ," he observed , " should be done with some spirit ."
Upon this principle Mr . Chip set to work with all possible alacrity .
Are you all here ?"
" Gentlemen , I am sorry to interrupt your amusements ; but , till you have contrary orders from me , no one , on pain of my serious displeasure , must go into THAT building " ( pointing to the place where the theatre was erecting ).
I depend , gentlemen , upon your obedience ."
To the dead silence with which these orders were received , succeeded in a few minutes a universal groan .
resumed the indignant manager .
" I ' ll make him know it , and I ' ll make YOU know it , too ," said Archer .
" Because we who know him , have never known him capricious ."
" Perhaps not .
I won ' t be made a fool of by a few soft words .
I am manager , and I will be manager ; and you shall see my theatre finished in spite of you , and MY party triumphant ."
We never heard of parties till you came amongst us ."
" No ; before I came , I say , nobody dared oppose you ; but I dare ; and I tell you to your face , take care of me -- a warm friend and a bitter enemy is my motto ."
" I am not your enemy !
Are you not my rival ?
Did not you want to be manager ?
" Oh , Mr . Chip , I am ordered to discharge you ."
" Bill , Mr . Chip !
why , you have not been at work for two hours !"
Archer immediately began to talk of the bill , and throwing down a guinea and a half , the conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly , and made his bow .
" Archers , Archers , to the Archers ' tree !
Follow your leader ," cried he , sounding his well known whistle as a signal .
His followers gathered round him , and he , raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the tree , counted his numbers , and then , in a voice lower than usual , addressed them thus :--" My friends , is there a Greybeard amongst us ?
No one stirred .
Join hands , my friends ."
" Oh ," interrupted a number of voices ; " but he is not a tyrant -- is he ?"
To this logic there was no answer ; but , still reluctant , they asked , " What they should GET by a Barring Out ?"
Bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law ; till he lets us into our own theatre again , or till he tells us his ' GOOD REASONS ' against it ."
Go !
Everybody thinks it is right , and everybody can ' t be wrong ."
By right and wrong , I mean lucky and unlucky ."
" My gipsy told you that already ."
Archer knew too well how to govern fools , to attempt to reason with them ; and , instead of laughing any longer at Fisher ' s ridiculous superstition , he was determined to take advantage of it .
Through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance , muffled up , and looking cautiously about her .
" There ' s nobody near us !"
I must take care of that first ."
" Bless me ," exclaimed Archer , suddenly stopping in this narration of his services , " there ' s one thing , after all , I ' ve forgot , we shall be undone without it .
" For candles ?"
said Fisher , confused ; " how many ?-- what sort ?"
He returned ; but not until a considerable time afterwards .
Order and punctuality , it appears , are necessary even in a Barring Out ; and even rebellion must have its laws .
The bars were all in the same moment put up to the windows , and Archer , when he had tried them all , and seen that they were secure , gave a loud " Huzza !"
" I don ' t know , indeed ," said the little boy , very gravely : " you shut me up amongst you .
But come , my merry men all , now to the feast .
Out with the table into the middle of the room .
Let ' s have things in style when we are about it , Mr .
" No , no ," cried the manager , " he shan ' t LIVE with us ; a Greybeard is not fit company for Archers ."
The Archers all stood up as their cups were filled to drink the health of their chief with a universal cheer .
said Townsend .
cried a third ; " mercy !
In vain they tried to appear gay .
The voices died away , and dropped off one by one .
The room had been built high to admit a free circulation of air .
said Archer , contemplating the group of sleepers before him .
I shall like to see the gardener ' s phiz through the trap - door , when he beholds the spikes under him !"
" It never came into my head that anybody would ever have thought of the ventilator but myself !"
exclaimed Archer , in great perplexity .
" Unbar the window !"
interrupted Archer ; " no , that I won ' t , for you or the gipsy either ; but I have heard enough to get your buns without that .
Archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his subscription ; at which sight all the company clapped their hands , and his popularity rose to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty .
She promised to be punctual , and having filled the bag with Fisher ' s twelve buns , they were drawn up in triumph , and everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the same bag drawn up at dinner - time .
No sooner had she received the money than her end was gained .
Archer , in the division of the food , had attempted , by the most scrupulous exactness , to content the public , and he was both astonished and provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached .
Is not this bun which I hold in my hand my own ?
I only begged you to keep it till supper - time , when perhaps you ' ll want it more , and Townsend , who can ' t bear the slightest thing that crosses his own whims , and who thinks there ' s nothing in this world to be minded but his own diversion , calls me a TYRANT .
ungrateful fools !"
He continued immovable in this posture for some time .
Touch him who dares !"
Townsend , at the head of the yawners , and Fisher , at the head of the hungry malcontents , gathered round Archer and the few yet unconquered spirits , demanding " How long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon ?
He flattered some with hopes of food from the town boys .
He ' s loose !"
" Your party !"
I have nine Fishermen ."
" One party is just as good as another ; it is only a question which can get the upper hand ; and we had your hands tied just now ."
Archer stood still , but the moment Fisher touched him he knocked him down to the ground , and turning to the rest , with eyes sparkling with indignation , " Archers !"
A voice at this instant was heard at the door .
It was De Grey ' s voice .
A large basket !
De Grey promised , upon his honour , that if he would unbar the door nobody should come in with him , and no advantage should be taken of them .
" Eat first ," said he , " and we will talk afterwards ."
I am to stay here till you give up .
Everyone looked at the empty basket .
Even Caesar himself , after breakfast , is quite another thing !"
" You may speak for yourself , Mr . Townsend ," replied the insulted hero , " but not for me , or for Archers in general , if you please .
Not so Fisher , whose memory was upon this occasion very distinct .
cried Archer , in an imperious tone , and there was silence .
cried he , looking at De Grey , with triumph ; " that ' s a method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner , which I learned from ' Richard Coeur de Lion .'
cried he , going to the ventilator .
We ' ll let it down , my lad , in a trice ; bar me out who can !"
" Pull away !
I don ' t know what has taken him out of the way now .
Let down quick !
I ' ve got the tailor ' s bag full , which is three times as large as yours , and I ' ve changed clothes with the tailor ' s boy ; so nobody took notice of me as I came down the street ."
there ' s my own cousin , I acknowledge .
A delightful review was now made of their treasure .
Townsend , who , in his prosperity as in adversity , saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his friends , pushed De Grey , who was looking on with a more good - natured and more thoughtful air .
" Nor I , either ," said the time serving Fisher , sidling up to the manager , and picking the ice off a piece of plum - cake , " nor I either ; I hate puns .
I ' m sure we are much obliged to you and your cousin .
I never thought he ' d have come .
" What is De Grey thinking of ?"
" I am thinking ," said De Grey , " that Dr . Middleton must believe that I have betrayed his confidence in me .
interrupted Townsend ; " are heroes allowed to change sides , pray ?
exclaimed Archer .
" Away with all these things !
I give up for De Grey ' s sake .
" Perhaps not ," said De Grey .
" You must , however , acknowledge ," replied De Grey , smiling , " that no man but a fool thinks it honourable to be in the wrong AT LAST .
" And Dr . Middleton -- why should you suspect him without reason any more than me ?"
" As to that ," said Archer , " he is your friend , and you are right to defend him ; and I won ' t say another word against him .
How can I ?"
" You are a good friend !"
When the rebels had sent an ambassador with their surrender , they stood in pale and silent suspense , waiting for their doom .
here he comes !"
His steady step was heard approaching nearer and nearer .
Fisher instantly fell on his knees .
" It is no delight to me to see people on their knees .
I hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong ?"
Punish me as you think proper .
VENGEANCE never looks to the FUTURE , but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past .
" Yes , I see that you have broken my windows ; that is a small evil ."
" Oh , sir !
How good !
Without obedience to the laws ," added he , turning to Archer , " as men , you cannot be suffered in society .
This is a long sermon , Mr . Archer , not preached to show my own eloquence , but to convince your understanding .
" Sir ," said Archer , " I brought five guineas with me to school .
This guinea is all that I have left ."
Dr . Middleton received the guinea which Archer offered him with a look of approbation , and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the schoolroom .
we will come the instant , the very instant the bell rings ; you shall have confidence in us ," cried they , eagerly .
" I deserve your confidence , I hope ," said Dr . Middleton ; " for it is my first wish to make you all happy .
" De Grey , you were in the right ," whispered Archer , " and it was I that was UNJUST ."
A loud cry , in which Archer ' s voice was heard most distinctly , declared De Grey ' s innocence .
In vain he solicited Archer and De Grey to intercede for him .
They returned in the evening with renewed ardour to their amusements , and retired to rest satisfied with themselves and pleased with each other .
Leonora was proud ; Cecilia was vain .
Mrs . Villars came forward , smiling , with the bracelet in her hand .
cried Louisa , bursting into tears .
At any other time they would have been more inclined to cry with Louisa ; but Cecilia had just been successful , and sympathy with the victorious often makes us forget justice .
" I didn ' t laugh at Louisa ; and I surely may laugh , for it does nobody any harm ."
Her thoughts were discomposed , and her mind was running upon something else .
She threw down the ninepins .
The triumph of SUCCESS is absolute , but short .
" Well , what do you want with me ?"
" Are we friends ?"
" We are , if you will let me tell Louisa that you are sorry --"
Cecilia , interrupting her , " Oh , pray let me hear no more about Louisa !"
" No ; not when you are unjust , Cecilia ."
I am not unjust ; and if I were , you are not my governess ."
" But you know , Cecilia --"
Louisa silently let go her companion ' s hand , and , quitting the dance , ran up to Leonora to inquire what was the matter with her .
Perhaps to tell things just as they were , she was not quite so much inclined to kiss Cecilia as she would have been before the fall of her mandarin ; but this was the utmost extent of her malice , if it can be called malice .
I ' m not playing with you , child !"
" I have not touched one , you covetous little creature !"
See how unjust you are !"
exclaimed Louisa ; " then I am sure you must have done something VERY naughty ."
cried Cecilia , catching hold of her .
" Let me go , let me go !"
" You don ' t , don ' t you ?"
cried Cecilia , provoked , and , catching the hat from Louisa , she flung the strawberries over the hedge .
" What , Cecilia !
" She ' s very sorry ; are not you , Cecilia ?
" Oh , you sweet - tempered girl !
At this instant , Mrs . Villars came out to enjoy the serenity of the evening , and , passing by the arbour where Cecilia lay , she started .
" No , madam , I am not afraid , but ashamed .
" And what , my dear ?"
" Certainly not ," said Mrs . Villars .
" I wish that mine could !"
Hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits ; and when fear did take possession of her mind , it was attended with total debility .
" Leonora said that I had , madam , and I felt ashamed when she said so ."
" Indeed I do not know what is meant by it , madam ; but it is something which everybody hates ."
If he continue to do so , he must conquer his sense of shame and lose his love of virtue .
This very evening , madam , when I was in a passion , I threw little Louisa ' s strawberries away , which , I am sure , I was very sorry for afterwards ; and Leonora and everybody cried out that I had a bad heart -- but I am sure I was only in a passion ."
I hope -- I am sure I never shall ."
Perhaps it would not yesterday , perhaps it might not to - morrow ; but that is no reason that I should despair of ever deserving it .
" How foolish !"
The First of June was now arrived , and all the young competitors were in a state of the most anxious suspense .
Their quarrel had never been finally adjusted , and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a reconciliation .
Leonora was her equal ; they were her inferiors , and submission is much easier to a vain mind , where it appears to be voluntary , than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or candour .
Her mother died when she was very young ; and though her father had supplied her place in the best and kindest manner , he had insensibly infused into his daughter ' s mind a portion of that enterprising , independent spirit which he justly deemed essential to the character of her brother .
This brother was some years older than Cecilia , but he had always been the favourite companion of her youth .
What her father ' s precepts inculcated , his example enforced ; and even Cecilia ' s virtues consequently became such as were more estimable in a man than desirable in a female .
Without determining which species of love is the most flattering to others , we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our minds .
They were both assiduous in their care of Louisa , but Leonora ' s want of exertion to overcome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived her of presence of mind , and prevented her from being so constantly useful as Cecilia .
Then , first returning into the hall , she found the peddler just unbuckling his box , and taking it off his shoulders .
Cecilia paid the money , and was just going to carry off the mandarin , when the peddler took out of his great - coat pocket a neat mahogany case .
It was about a foot long , and fastened at each end by two little clasps .
It was a figure of Flora , crowned with roses , and carrying a basket of flowers in her hand .
" How I should like to give this to Louisa !"
Oh , yes !
At this moment , so critical for Cecilia , a party of her companions opened the door .
The peddler named the price , and Leonora took the box .
" I hope I didn ' t disturb you ," said Leonora .
Leonora unscrewed it .
Leonora ' s colour changed .
" If you love me , Louisa ," said Leonora , " say nothing about the box ."
" No , my dear , I ' m afraid she has not ."
Louisa looked surprised .
Cecilia opened the door , came forward smiling , as if secure of a good reception , and taking the Flora out of the case , she placed it on the mantlepiece , opposite to Louisa ' s bed .
" Yes , I know it is ; and I meant that it should be so .
and what Leonora gave me ?
Humiliated and grieved by these reflections , Cecilia began to search in her own mind for some consoling idea .
She began to compare her conduct with that of others of her own age ; and at length , fixing her comparison upon her brother George , as the companion of whom , from her infancy , she had been habitually the most emulous , she recollected that an almost similar circumstance had once happened to him , and that he had not only escaped disgrace , but had acquired glory , by an intrepid confession of his fault .
Leonora sat opposite to her , and she was not a little surprised to see Cecilia look so gay and unconstrained .
Whose , then , will it be ?"
She knocked softly at Louisa ' s door .
" Come in ," said Louisa ; " I ' m not asleep .
Oh ," said she , starting up with the Flora in her hand , the instant that the door was opened ; " I ' m so glad you are come , Leonora , for I did so long to hear what you all were making such a noise about .
Have you forgot that the bracelet --"
is this the evening ?"
inquired Leonora .
" I ' ve kept it in my pocket this fortnight ; and though Cecilia did give me this Flora , I still love you a great deal better ."
asked Louisa ; " I don ' t like her for being jealous of you ."
" But , dear Leonora , why should you lose it ?"
Leonora !
" Oh , I am sure , by the way they speak to you , that they won ' t give you the prize !"
" Oh , she never will take any trouble about anything ," said one of the party ; " let ' s go away ."
" Oh , go , go !
They are gone to seek for her .
Such was Cecilia ' s situation when Leonora , accompanied by her companions , opened the hall door .
The crowd divided .
It is yours .
" Oh , madam !
Oh , Leonora !"
If anybody else had told me so , I could not have believed them , because I remember the box so well ; but I can ' t help believing Leonora .'
I guessed her reason .'
" Then , surely , not your best friend ," said Leonora , kissing her .
" The children are busied in various ways .
" Other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells , which , particularly in the spring season , is drunk in great abundance .
" The buyers keep a sharp look out to see that they have enough for their little piece of copper ; and the Lilliputian tradesmen act with no less caution as the exigencies of the case may require , to prevent his being cheated out of a morsel ."
The advantages of truth and honesty , and the value of a character for integrity , are very early felt amongst these little merchants in their daily intercourse with each other .
In all his childish traffic , Francisco , imitating his parents , was scrupulously honest , and therefore all his companions trusted him --" As honest as Francisco ," became a sort of proverb amongst them .
" Let them say so ; I say , ' As sharp as Piedro '; and let us see which will go through the world best ."
* And he took frequent opportunities of explaining the meaning of this maxim to his son .
said the gardener .
" He is smart and quick enough , but he is always in mischief .
I track his footsteps all over my vineyard ."
* E meglio esser fortunato che savio .
Venture a small fish , as the proverb says , to catch a great one .
You are a droll chap ," said his father , " and will sell my fish cleverly , I ' ll be bound .
He made up to him directly , crying , " Fish !
" Was it caught to - day ?"
Piedro received nearly half as much again for his fish as he ought to have done .
" The poor fellow , however , shall have a little of this water ," added he , leading the ass to a pool by the roadside .
" I should be ashamed to beg , or borrow either ," said Francisco .
asked Francisco .
" And you have never considered , then ," said Francisco , " that all these people will , one after another , find you out in time ?"
" And next summer ," observed Francisco , " what will you do ?"
Why , now , suppose the blockheads , after they had been taken in and found it out , all joined against me , and would buy none of our fish -- what then ?
What do you think of turning merchant , and selling sugar - plums and cakes to the children in their market ?
" I think not ," said Francisco ; " but I think the children would find out in time if they were cheated , and would like it as little as the men ."
Then IN TIME I could , you know , change my trade -- sell chips and sticks in the wood - market -- hand about the lemonade to the fine folks , or twenty other things .
said Piedro , angrily .
It ' s better to be lucky than wise , as MY father says .
The foreign servant lad , to whom Francisco had so honestly , or , as Piedro said , so sillily , shown the bruised side of the melon , was an Englishman .
They heard his cry of " Fresh fish !
Here their conversation was interrupted by the same English lad , who smiled as he came up to Francisco , and taking up a fine pine - apple , he said , in a mixture of bad Italian and English --" I need not look at the other side of this ; you will tell me if it is not as good as it looks .
inquired Francisco .
" We must , then , pick out the best for him ," at the same time singling out a tempting bunch .
I ' ll come to your village .
What can I want more ?"
" Oh , my brave boy , we know you are a grateful , good son ; but I have been your age myself ; you have companions , you have little expenses of your own .
" Thank you , father ; and if I prosper at all , it shall be by those means , and no other , or I should not be worthy to be called your son ."
* The Duke de Rochefoucault .--" On peut etre puls fin qu ' un autre , mais pas plus fin que tous les autres ."
Am I to lose my customers by your tricks , and then find you here eating my all ?
All the little merchants were spectators of this scene , and heard his father ' s words : " You ARE a rogue , and the worst of rogues , who scruples not to cheat his own father ."
" I was very hungry , and that ' s what I am now , without anybody ' s caring anything about it .
" And to me less than anybody ," replied Piedro , in an insinuating tone , " _I , _ that am so much obliged to you !"
" A bunch of grapes , and a few figs , are no mighty obligation ," said Francisco , smiling ; " I wish I could do more for you .
You seem , indeed , to have been very unhappy of late .
We never see you in the markets as we used to do ."
" Ay , to be sure ; that would be still better ," said Piedro , observing that Francisco , as he uttered his last sentence , was separating the grapes and other fruits into two equal divisions .
" To be sure I would rather you would BE than SEEM a friend to me ; but I thought that was too much to ask at first , though I have a notion , notwithstanding I have been so UNLUCKY lately -- I have a notion you would have no reason to repent of it .
can ' t you ?"
He was embarrassed ; for he pitied Piedro , and he scarcely knew how to point out to him that something more is necessary in a partner in trade besides activity , and that is honesty .
" Say what you please for me ."
All seemed disposed to believe in his intended reformation , and to give him a fair trial .
These favourable dispositions towards him were the consequence of Francisco ' s benevolent representations .
He told them that he thought Piedro had suffered enough to cure him of his tricks , and that it would be cruelty in them , because he might once have been in fault , to banish him by their reproaches from amongst them , and thus to prevent him from the means of gaining his livelihood honestly .
The satisfaction he felt from this alteration in their manners was at first delightful to Piedro ; but in proportion to his credit , his opportunities of defrauding increased ; and these became temptations which he had not the firmness to resist .
" What signifies my good character , if I make so little by it ?"
But Piedro was in too great haste to get rich to take time into his account .
He observed that the younger part of the community were extremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums , and of burnt almonds .
He measured the sugar - plums in a little cubical tin box ; and this , it was affirmed , he heaped up to the top , and pressed down before he poured out the contents into the open hands of his approving customers .
" Ha !
cried he , stopping to read what was written on Piedro ' s board .
" This promises rarely .
Old as I am , and tall of my age , which makes the matter worse , I am still as fond of sugar - plums as my little sister , who is five years younger than I .
" No credit do I ask ," replied the lively boy ; " when I told you I loved sugar - plums , did I tell you I loved them , or even my sister , so well as to run in debt for them ?
not when you have , by your own account , been out of them a great while ?
" I never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else ," said Carlo --" I wish , moreover , you may not injure yourself .
a discovery !
' Think twice of a good bargain ,' says the proverb ."
He has behaved so well for some time past , that I intended this very evening to have gone to him , and to have told him that I was willing to do for him what he has long begged of me to do -- to enter into partnership with him ."
Francisco !-- your measure , lend us your measure !"
Bankers and merchants used formerly to count their money , and write their bills of exchange upon benches in the streets ; and when a merchant or banker lost his credit , and was unable to pay his debts , his bench was broken .
The little Neapolitan merchants will have no knaves amongst them !
Break his bench !
There was a prodigious number , more than would have filled many honest measures , scattered upon the ground and trampled under foot by the crowd .
Piedro could never more show his face in this market , and all hopes of friendship -- all hopes of partnership with Francisco -- were for ever at an end .
If rogues would calculate , they would cease to be rogues ; for they would certainly discover that it is most for their interest to be honest -- setting aside the pleasure of being esteemed and beloved , of having a safe conscience , with perfect freedom from all the various embarrassments and terror to which knaves are subject .
He examined it carefully , and he found Carlo ' s name written upon it , and the name of the street where he lived ; and though it was considerably out of his way , he set out immediately to restore the rule , which was a very handsome one , to its rightful owner .
You may guess I should have been sorry enough to have lost it .
I ' ll do it to - morrow , and it shall be the admiration of the market .
" Why , yes ," said Francisco ; " since you are so good - natured , perhaps you ' d be kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures that I see upon your rule .
" That I ' ll explain to you with pleasure , as far as I know them myself ; but when I ' m at fault , my father , who is cleverer than I am , and understands trigonometry , can help us out ."
" Trigonometry !"
" I looked just as you do now - - I felt just as you do now -- all in a fright and a puzzle , when I first heard of angles and sines , and cosines , and arcs and centres , and complements and tangents ."
Oh , I see we must be good friends , just made for each other ; so come in -- no ceremony ."
Rosetta , at this speech , burst out laughing , and said that she did not know till then that she had any bridge on her nose .
The boy who had them to sell was very good - natured ; he poured them into my lap , and said I had such an honest face he would trust me , and that as he was in a great hurry , he could not wait an hour whilst I sold my wood ; but that he was sure I would pay him in the evening , and he told me that he would call here this evening for the money .
Won ' t that be better than crying ?"
" And is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut it still to be seen ?"
" We can go to it ," said Francisco , " and I hope we shall recover your basketful ."
The baker had in his hand the bit of wood with which he was that instant going to feed his oven .
cried Rosetta , who ran into the baker ' s shop first ; and as he heard " Stop !
re - echoed by many voices , the baker stopped ; and turning to Francisco , Carlo and Arthur , begged , with a countenance of some surprise , to know why they had desired him to stop .
He desired to be paid in bread , and my bread was not quite baked when he was here .
I hope he is not the boy who sold you the wood , Mr .
Arthur could not , especially as he spoke wretched Italian , make the eager little merchants understand the nature and advantages of an English trial by jury .
The prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market ; and the moment sentence was pronounced , Piedro was hissed and hooted out of the market - place .
Thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of earning his bread .
He then took to the waters from the sulphurous springs , and served them about to foreigners ; but one day , as he was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door , he slipped his foot , and broke his glasses .
Francisco was all this time acquiring knowledge from his new friends , without neglecting his own or his father ' s business .
" Because ," said Carlo , laughing again at the recollection , " you held your pencil so drolly ; and when you were to cut it , you cut it just as if you were using a pruning - knife to your vines ; but now it is your turn to laugh , for you surpass us all .
" Take them , then ," said Carlo ; " I wish all Naples could see them , provided they might be liked half as well as I like them ."
It remained for many years buried .
The lava which covered it became in time fit for vegetation , plants grew there , a new soil was formed , and a new town called Portici was built over this place where Herculaneum formerly stood .
" I am interested in this lad from what I have learned of his good conduct .
Let us do something for him .
I trust , from the character I have heard of you , that they will be perfectly safe here ."
Had you half the taste I gave you credit for , you would have singled it out from all the rest , and have it fixed in your memory ."
Is it possible that you never thought of opening it ?"
Sit you down here beside me ; and we will look over these books together ."
Follow me ."
Thus , even Francisco ' s talents could not have advanced him in the world , unless they had been united to integrity .
Whilst the English Arthur , with as warm a heart , was more temperate in his praise , declaring that this was " the most like an English summer ' s evening of any he had ever felt since he came to Italy : and that , moreover , the cream was almost as good as what he had been used to drink in Cheshire ."
" That rule ," said he , " has been the cause of all my present happiness , and I thank you for --"
Whether Piedro really meant to have carried off the poor man ' s hat , or whether he was , as he said , merely in jest , we leave it to those who know his general character to decide .
Francisco , a word with you , if you have done crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so attentively ."
You stare when I tell you I am rich ; but the thing is so .
I have friends in Naples , and I call myself Piedro the Lucky .
I hope he came honestly by them ," said Carlo ; " but ever since the affair of the double measure , I suspect double - dealing always from him .
All Piedro ' s neighbours did not follow this peaceable maxim ; for when he and his father began to circulate the story of the treasure found in the garden , the village of Resina did not give them implicit faith .
Piedro had never found any treasure in his father ' s garden , but he came by his gold in the following manner :--
She was uncertain where she had dropped it ; the shop , the carriage , the street , were searched for it in vain .
Concern yourself no more about it ."
Piedro was not inclined thus to relinquish his booty , and he now thought proper to vary in his account of the manner in which he found the cross .
Piedro ' s father saw that his SMART son , though scarcely sixteen years of age , was a match for him in villainy .
Francisco continued the happy and useful course of his life .
*
One morning , Francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the front of an ancient temple , amongst the ruins of Herculaneum .
They brought to his recollection similar facts , which he had often heard his father mention in his childhood , as having been observed previous to the last eruption of Mount Vesuvius .
Some of the inhabitants of Resina , whom he questioned , declared that they had heard strange rumbling noises underground ; and a peasant and his son , who had been at work the preceding day in a vineyard , a little above the village , related that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of the earth , close to them ; and that they had , at the same time , heard a noise like the going off of a pistol .
1795 , first part .
In the meantime , Francisco went to the villa where his English friends resided .
It is sufficient here to say that , in the space of about five hours , the wretched inhabitants of Torre del Greco saw their town utterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the mountain .
Numbers of those who had been forced from their houses now returned to the ruins to try to save whatever they could .
" Has the count abandoned his villa ?
and is there no one to take care of his plate and furniture ?
Francisco immediately went to the count ' s house in warn him of his danger .
The wind blows that way .
Francisco waited not to hear more ; but instantly , without explaining his intentions to anyone , set out for the count ' s villa , and , with a bucket of water in his hand , crossed the beds of lava with which the house was encompassed ; when , reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were left , he plunged them into the water , and returned with them in safety over the lava , yet warm under his feet .
" Bravo !
" Bravo !
What is all this disturbance in the streets ?"
A lad who held by his arm stopped suddenly on hearing the name of Francisco , which the people were repeating with so much enthusiasm .
Promise me you won ' t touch it now ," said he , throwing down the hat at his feet , " or you hear not one word I have to say .
" Likely to become rich !
" How , pray , is he likely to become rich enough to be a signor ?"
* La mala compagnia e quella che mena uomini a la forca .
" No ," said Piedro ; " that is not his nature .
Piedro , you look pale .
Piedro , when he was alone , tried to collect his thoughts -- all his thoughts were full of horror .
The hours passed away , the shadows of the houses lengthened under his footsteps , the evening came on , and when it grew dusk , after hesitating in great agony of mind for some time , his fear of the robbers ' vengeance prevailed over every other feeling , and he went at the appointed hour to the place of meeting .
At the moment Piedro knocked at the back door , the front shop was full of customers ; and the Jew ' s boy , whose office it was to attend to these signals , let Piedro in , told him that none of his comrades were yet come , and left him in a room by himself .
A few days ago I had fine things in readiness for the Countess de Flora ' s birthday , which was to have been celebrated at the count ' s villa ."
said Piedro .
" A great while ago ; no wonder you have forgotten me ," said the man ; " but I can recall the night to your recollection .
That lady , though I did not know it till lately , was the Countess de Flora ."
The string which held it cracked , and broke with the pull he gave it .
He imagined that at this moment his fate was decided ; that Saint Januarius deserted him , and that he was undone .
He precipitately followed the firework - man the instant he left the shop , and seizing hold of his arm , whispered , " I must speak to you ."
Nay , hear me , I confess that I purloined that diamond cross ; but I can do the count a great service , upon condition that he pardons me .
They will set out five hours hence .
The robbers were there .
This pistol was snapped by their captain at poor Francisco , who had bravely asserted that he would , as long as he had life , defend the property committed to his care .
The pistol missed fire , for it was charged with some of the damaged powder which the Jew had bought that evening from the firework maker , and which he had sold as excellent immediately afterwards to his favourite customers -- the robbers who met at his house .
" It is not much -- only a slight wound ," said Francisco ; " one that I should have escaped , if I had been upon my guard ; but the sight of a face that I little expected to see in such company took from me all presence of mind ; and one of the ruffians stabbed me here in the arm , whilst I stood in stupid astonishment ."
take me to prison !
The next morning Piedro was conveyed to prison ; and as he passed through the streets of Naples he was met by several of those who had known him when he was a child .
He was ordered to remain twelve months in solitary confinement .
" Yes , son , and a charming one it is , and a handsome piece of land near it -- all at a safe distance , too , from Mount Vesuvius ; and can you guess how I came by it ?-- it was given to me for having a good son ."
To Mr . Lee , the English gentleman , he offered one of his own drawings -- a fruit - piece .
" I like this very well ," said Arthur , as he examined the drawing , " but I should like this melon better if it was a little bruised .
He was honest , obedient , active and good - natured , hence he was esteemed by his master ; and being beloved by all his companions who were good , he did not desire to be loved by the bad ; nor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle , mischievous or dishonest boys attempted to plague or ridicule him .
His friend Loveit , on the contrary , wished to be universally liked , and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy in the school -- and so he was .
" Am I ?"
" Afraid OF DOING WRONG !"
and what Hardy said was only for fear I should get in disgrace ; he ' s the best friend I have ."
I had better go back , and just tell them that I ' m very sorry I can ' t get their shuttlecock ; do come back with me ."
" Oh , indeed !"
" Indeed , Tarlton ," expostulated he , without looking him in the face , " I do wish you ' d give up this scheme ; I daresay all the apples are gone by this time ; I wish you would .
" HATE me !"
" Poor Loveit !
There was a small window at the end of the back staircase , through which , between nine and ten o ' clock at night , Tarlton , accompanied by Loveit and another boy , crept out .
Yet now and then , at every rustling of the leaves , they started , and their hearts beat violently .
This , however , he could by no means persuade them to do , until they had filled their pockets with apples ; then , to his great joy , they returned , crept in at the window and each retired , as softly as possible , to his own apartment .
The room door was apt to creak , but it was opened with such precaution , that no noise could be heard , and Loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left him .
Everyone was astonished that Hardy , with all his quickness and penetration , had not yet discovered their proceedings ; but Loveit could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to be .
nothing at all !"
In the meantime , the visits to the apple - tree had been now too frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage .
Nor was he in the least avaricious , for though he was not rich , he had enough to live upon , because he had been very industrious in his youth ; and he was always very ready to part with the little he had .
The old man , with farmer Kent ' s assistance , chained him fast to the trunk of the apple - tree .
oh , pray , help me !
Nor could he help observing that Tarlton , with all his vaunted prowess , was the first to run away from the appearance of danger .
said he .
" Lord love you , lad !
so we do ; but we love ourselves better ."
Think no more about it .
" I forgive it with all my heart ," said he ; " but I cannot forget it so soon !"
I wish you ' d let me alone ," said Loveit ; yet at the same time he suffered himself to he led away .
" Look here ," said Tarlton , drawing something from his pocket wrapped in a blue handkerchief .
" Raw meat !"
" Nay , but stay ," said Tarlton , catching hold of his arm , " stay ; I was only joking ."
He lay and howled and writhed himself !"
Poor Loveit , in haste to get away , returned to his friend Hardy ; but his mind was in such agitation , that he neither talked nor moved like himself ; and two or three times his heart was so full that he was ready to burst into tears .
replied Tarlton , in an audacious tone , as if he meant to set his inquiring eye at defiance .
About ten minutes after this , as he and Hardy were undressing , Hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass .
And as he was receiving Hardy ' s commission , Loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of his pocket .
Nor did he watch long in vain .
continued Loveit .
don ' t betray me !
" I will not betray you , trust to me ," said Hardy : and he left the room , and Loveit stood in amazement ; while , in the meantime , Hardy , in hopes of overtaking Tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided , ran with all possible speed across the meadow , then down the lane .
said Tom , clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket .
I didn ' t !
I don ' t know what you mean ," said Tom , trembling , though he was by far the stronger of the two .
Tom was terrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter ; his strength forsook him , and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the hedge , he ran away with all his speed .
Full of the pleasure of successful benevolence , Hardy tripped joyfully home , and vaulted over the window sill , when the first object he beheld was Mr . Power , the usher , standing at the head of the stairs , with his candle in his hand .
Hardy obeyed in silence .
raw meat !
" Pray , sir ," said Hardy , eagerly , " let that meat be burned , it is poisoned ."
" Poisoned !"
Speak ."
Hardy was silent .
very well !
very fine !
His composure threw Mr . Power into a rage too great for utterance .
I will except nothing .
when you had promised , too !
what a scrape you have brought us into , Loveit , it ' s all your fault !"
They listened --" Here he is coming !
They knelt down to prayers , and the moment they rose , Mr . William Power , laying his hand upon the table , cried , " Stand still , gentlemen , if you please ."
" WHAT has he told ?"
" I , sir ?"
" Ay , sir ," interrupted Mr . William Power , " get that out of him if you can -- ask him ."
said Mr . Trueman , taking one out of the basket .
" Don ' t you know this handkerchief , sir ?"
Hardy was silent .
" Now , gentlemen ," said Mr . Trueman , " I am not fond of punishing you ; but when I do it , you know , it is always in earnest .
" J .
I hope you won ' t make me an example for the rest .
" Oh , they have been punished enough ," said the old man ; " forgive them , sir ."
I will water it , and take care of it with my own hands for your sake , as long as I am able .
At these times she taught them something , which , she said , she hoped they would remember all their lives .
" Yes ," said the old woman ; " I will try what you can do ; but I must go up the hill along with you for the first two or three times , for fear you should get yourselves hurt ."
" Only a pinch -- only one pinch that I got , as I was putting a stone behind a wheel of a chaise .
My scotcher will do without anything else , I hope .
The morning came ; but no carriages were heard , though Paul and his sister had risen at five o ' clock , that they might be sure to be ready for early travellers .
Paul had taken the halfpence out of his hat , and he had put them into a hole in the high bank by the roadside ; and Anne said she would not meddle with them , and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them ; and Paul said --" If you will stay and watch here , I will go and gather some blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field .
What sort of thing ?"
" And you ' ll bring the blanket to me , and I shall make the bed very neatly , that will be all right -- all happy !"
" But stay !
Hush !
don ' t clap your hands so , Anne ; it will not be all happy , I ' m afraid ," said Paul , and his countenance changed , and he looked very grave .
" Some of the people in those chaises , Paul .
" No ," said Paul , " for when she called you to the chaise door , she said , ' Here ' s some halfpence for you .'
" My dear , honest children ," said she , " I am very glad you told me all this .
" What ' s that he says about a dark green chaise ?"
In the passage there was standing a decent , clean , good natured looking woman , with two huge straw baskets on each side of her .
exclaimed the woman to whom they belonged .
" We ' ll help you to pick them up if you will let us ," cried Paul and Anne ; and they immediately ran to her assistance .
" No , brother ," said Anne , " this is not the gentleman that was reading ."
Here ' s the postillion can tell you so .
You are famous for larks at Dunstable ; and I make it a rule to taste the best of everything wherever I go ; and , waiter , let me have a bottle of claret .
Do you hear ?"
" A trifle , ma ' am ," said the basket - woman .
" When they come to their wine ," added she , " I ' ll speak a good word for you , and get you called in afore the children are sent to bed ."
The children gathered round her large pannier as it opened , but they did not touch any of her things .
" To wear when people are powdering their hair ," continued the gentleman , " that they may not spoil their other shoes ."
He rang the bell , and desired the waiter to let the gentleman who was in the room opposite to him know that he wished to see him .
said Paul .
If I find that they are , I will do something more for you ."
" But ," said Anne , " we must tell all this to grandmother , and ask her about it ; and I ' m afraid -- though I ' m very happy -- that it is getting very late , and that we should not stay here any longer ."
I ' ll walk with you , and see you safe home myself ."
" Your grandmother will sleep well upon this good blanket , I hope ," said the gentleman , as he gave it into Paul ' s opened arms .
" It has been obtained for her by the honesty of her adopted children ."

Not a mightier whale than this In the vast Atlantic is ; Not a fatter fish than he , Flounders round the Polar Sea ."
I answered , " we have been stove by a whale ."
" A mariner sat in the shrouds one night , The wind was piping free ; Now bright , now dimmed , was the moonlight pale , And the phospher gleamed in the wake of the whale , As it floundered in the sea ."
October 13 .
There she blows !
" Two miles and a half ."
Call all hands ."
Being once pursued by a whale which he had wounded , he parried the assault for some time with a lance ; but the furious monster at length rushed on the boat ; himself and comrades only being preserved by leaping into the water when they saw the onset was inevitable ."
" The whale fell directly over him , and probably killed him in a moment ."
The vessel under short sail , with look - outs at the mast - heads , eagerly scanning the wide expanse around them , has a totally different air from those engaged in regular voyage ."
" It is generally well known that out of the crews of Whaling vessels ( American ) few ever return in the ships on board of which they departed ."
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation .
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp , drizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and methodically knocking people ' s hats off -- then , I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can .
If they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .
Its extreme downtown is the battery , where that noble mole is washed by waves , and cooled by breezes , which a few hours previous were out of sight of land .
Inlanders all , they come from lanes and alleys , streets and avenues -- north , east , south , and west .
Say you are in the country ; in some high land of lakes .
What is the chief element he employs ?
Besides , passengers get sea - sick -- grow quarrelsome -- don ' t sleep of nights -- do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ;-- no , I never go as a passenger ; nor , though I am something of a salt , do I ever go to sea as a Commodore , or a Captain , or a Cook .
True , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a grasshopper in a May meadow .
The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us .
The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills , and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven .
He thinks he breathes it first ; but not so .
Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity .
Not ignoring what is good , I am quick to perceive a horror , and could still be social with it -- would they let me -- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in .
Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed , and that no way of reaching that place would offer , till the following Monday .
It was a very dubious - looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless .
I knew no one in the place .
So on I went .
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low , wide building , the door of which stood invitingly open .
The universe is finished ; the copestone is on , and the chips were carted off a million years ago .
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?
THAT once found out , and all the rest were plain .
But stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ?
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and one was sickle - shaped , with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new - mown grass by a long - armed mower .
On one side stood a long , low , shelf - like table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world ' s remotest nooks .
" But avast ," he added , tapping his forehead , " you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer ' s blanket , have ye ?
I sat down on an old wooden settle , carved all over like a bench on the Battery .
Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats , and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters , all bedarned and ragged , and their beards stiff with icicles , they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador .
The liquor soon mounted into their heads , as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea , and they began capering about most obstreperously .
He stood full six feet in height , with noble shoulders , and a chest like a coffer - dam .
The landlord was near spraining his wrist , and I told him for heaven ' s sake to quit -- the bed was soft enough to suit me , and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank .
Still , looking round me again , and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person ' s bed , I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer .
I ' ll have a good look at him then , and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all -- there ' s no telling .
getting into a towering rage .
" It ' s broke a ' ready ," said he .
I come to your house and want a bed ; you tell me you can only give me half a one ; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer .
And in the first place , you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head , which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad , and I ' ve no idea of sleeping with a madman ; and you , sir , YOU I mean , landlord , YOU , sir , by trying to induce me to do so knowingly , would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution ."
" Depend upon it , landlord , that harpooneer is a dangerous man ."
Why , afore we give it up , Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it .
I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat , ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin .
They were stains of some sort or other .
Now , while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning , this harpooneer never noticed me at all .
He might take a fancy to mine -- heavens !
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image , feeling but ill at ease meantime -- to see what was next to follow .
At last extinguishing the fire , he took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock .
" Who - e debel you ?"
" You gettee in ," he added , motioning to me with his tomahawk , and throwing the clothes to one side .
I stood looking at him a moment .
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian .
The Counterpane .
My sensations were strange .
the small of my back ached to think of it .
Nay , to this very hour , I often puzzle myself with it .
I now strove to rouse him --" Queequeg !"
Meanwhile , I lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature .
When , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , reconciled to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself .
What under the heavens he did it for , I cannot tell , but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand , and hat on -- under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , I inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots .
But Queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage -- neither caterpillar nor butterfly .
Seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; I begged him as well as I could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible .
The rest of his toilet was soon achieved , and he proudly marched out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a marshal ' s baton .
I quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar - room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly .
The bar - room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom I had not as yet had a good look at .
They were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns .
You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore .
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore .
" Grub , ho !"
Not always , though : Ledyard , the great New England traveller , and Mungo Park , the Scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor .
Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere .
To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding .
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him , and using it there without ceremony ; reaching over the table with it , to the imminent jeopardy of many heads , and grappling the beefsteaks towards him .
The Street .
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came .
In some things you would think them but a few hours old .
He wears a beaver hat and swallow - tailed coat , girdled with a sailor - belt and sheath - knife .
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation , and joins the great whale - fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport .
how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale , when thou art driven , straps , buttons , and all , down the throat of the tempest .
It is a land of oil , true enough : but not like Canaan ; a land , also , of corn and wine .
Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion , and your question will be answered .
In summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples -- long avenues of green and gold .
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye cannot , save in Salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands .
The Chapel .
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance ; because he was the only one who could not read , and , therefore , was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall .
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation , I knew not ; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief , that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those , in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh .
Oh !
In what census of living creatures , the dead of mankind are included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of them , that they tell no tales , though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands ; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world , we prefix so significant and infidel a word , and yet do not thus entitle him , if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth ; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death - forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal , unstirring paralysis , and deadly , hopeless trance , yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city .
But Faith , like a jackal , feeds among the tombs , and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope .
The Pulpit .
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec .
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers .
What could be more full of meaning ?-- for the pulpit is ever this earth ' s foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world .
Father Mapple rose , and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense .
There was a low rumbling of heavy sea - boots among the benches , and a still slighter shuffling of women ' s shoes , and all was quiet again , and every eye on the preacher .
" The ribs and terrors in the whale , Arched over me a dismal gloom , While all God ' s sun - lit waves rolled by , And lift me deepening down to doom .
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah ' s deep sealine sound !
There lurks , perhaps , a hitherto unheeded meaning here .
But he rallies .
But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent .
And taken with the context , this is full of meaning .
" Now Jonah ' s Captain , shipmates , was one whose discernment detects crime in any , but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless .
' Oh !
But the sea rebels ; he will not bear the wicked burden .
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah ' s head ; in all this raging tumult , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep .
He sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him .
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat .
Sin not ; but if you do , take heed to repent of it like Jonah ."
I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners ; and therefore to ye , and still more to me , for I am a greater sinner than ye .
How being an anointed pilot - prophet , or speaker of true things , and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh , Jonah , appalled at the hostility he should raise , fled from his mission , and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa .
As we have seen , God came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom , and with swift slantings tore him along ' into the midst of the seas ,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and ' the weeds were wrapped about his head ,' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him .
And what was that , shipmates ?
Delight ,-- top - gallant delight is to him , who acknowledges no law or lord , but the Lord his God , and is only a patriot to heaven .
And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his , who coming to lay him down , can say with his final breath -- O Father !-- chiefly known to me by Thy rod -- mortal or immortal , here I die .
Yet this is nothing : I leave eternity to Thee ; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God ?"
Returning to the Spouter - Inn from the Chapel , I found Queequeg there quite alone ; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time .
It may seem ridiculous , but it reminded me of General Washington ' s head , as seen in the popular busts of him .
Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed .
Whilst I was thus closely scanning him , half - pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement , he never heeded my presence , never troubled himself with so much as a single glance ; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book .
Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous , and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning , I thought this indifference of his very strange .
He made no advances whatever ; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances .
I ' ll try a pagan friend , thought I , since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy .
I drew my bench near him , and made some friendly signs and hints , doing my best to talk with him meanwhile .
We then turned over the book together , and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing , and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it .
And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his , and keeping it regularly passing between us .
By certain signs and symptoms , I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , I deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , I would comply or otherwise .
But what is worship ?-- to do the will of God -- THAT is worship .
So I kindled the shavings ; helped prop up the innocent little idol ; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg ; salamed before him twice or thrice ; kissed his nose ; and that done , we undressed and went to bed , at peace with our own consciences and all the world .
Man and wife , they say , there open the very bottom of their souls to each other ; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning .
The more so , I say , because truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast .
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire , which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich .
Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal .
For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me , even in bed , because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then .
Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor ; and seeing what the sailors did there ; and then going on to Nantucket , and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also , poor Queequeg gave it up for lost .
Hence the queer ways about him , though now some time from home .
By hints , I asked him whether he did not propose going back , and having a coronation ; since he might now consider his father dead and gone , he being very old and feeble at the last accounts .
I asked him what might be his immediate purpose , touching his future movements .
The grinning landlord , as well as the boarders , seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg -- especially as Peter Coffin ' s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with .
Well ; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride ' s bamboo cottage , this Captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honour , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the High Priest and his majesty the King , Queequeg ' s father .
Seeing himself placed next the Priest , and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself -- being Captain of a ship -- as having plain precedence over a mere island King , especially in the King ' s own house -- the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl ;-- taking it I suppose for a huge finger - glass .
On one side , New Bedford rose in terraces of streets , their ice - covered trees all glittering in the clear , cold air .
Gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his snortings .
His dusky nostrils swelled apart ; he showed his filed and pointed teeth .
So full of this reeling scene were we , as we stood by the plunging bowsprit , that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers , a lubber - like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable ; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro .
" What him say ?"
said Queequeg , as he mildly turned to me .
" Look you ," roared the Captain , " I ' ll kill - e YOU , you cannibal , if you try any more of your tricks aboard here ; so mind your eye ."
Nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale .
From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle ; yea , till poor Queequeg took his last long dive .
He only asked for water -- fresh water -- something to wipe the brine off ; that done , he put on dry clothes , lighted his pipe , and leaning against the bulwarks , and mildly eyeing those around him , seemed to be saying to himself --" It ' s a mutual , joint - stock world , in all meridians .
See what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse .
Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there , they don ' t grow naturally ; that they import Canada thistles ; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask ; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome ; that people there plant toadstools before their houses , to get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade of grass makes an oasis , three blades in a day ' s walk a prairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes , something like Laplander snow - shoes ; that they are so shut up , belted about , every way inclosed , surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean , that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering , as to the backs of sea turtles .
But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois .
Let America add Mexico to Texas , and pile Cuba upon Canada ; let the English overswarm all India , and hang out their blazing banner from the sun ; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer ' s .
For years he knows not the land ; so that when he comes to it at last , it smells like another world , more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman .
Chowder .
A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes , TWO of them , one for Queequeg , and one for me .
and a pair of prodigious black pots too !
Hussey ."
And so it turned out ; Mr . Hosea Hussey being from home , but leaving Mrs . Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs .
says I , " but that ' s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time , ain ' t it , Mrs .
" Queequeg ," said I , " do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam ?"
In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again , but with a different flavor , and in good time a fine cod - chowder was placed before us .
We resumed business ; and while plying our spoons in the bowl , thinks I to myself , I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head ?
What ' s that stultifying saying about chowder - headed people ?
Mrs . Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra ; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark - skin .
Supper concluded , we received a lamp , and directions from Mrs . Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed ; but , as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs , the lady reached forth her arm , and demanded his harpoon ; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers .
" Because it ' s dangerous ," says she .
But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg , I was obliged to acquiesce ; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor , that should quickly settle that trifling little affair .
A cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies .
Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm , she sported there a tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass , curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe .
The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest , felt like the Tartar , when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw .
And half concealed in this queer tenement , I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship ' s work suspended , was now enjoying respite from the burden of command .
said I , advancing to the door of the tent .
he demanded .
" Nothing , Sir ; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn .
I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships .
" Well , sir , I want to see what whaling is .
" Who is Captain Ahab , sir ?"
" I am mistaken then .
We are part owners and agents .
But as I was going to say , if thou wantest to know what whaling is , as thou tellest ye do , I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it , past backing out .
But let us understand each other .
But concentrating all his crow ' s feet into one scowl , Captain Peleg started me on the errand .
" Not much ," I replied --" nothing but water ; considerable horizon though , and there ' s a squall coming up , I think ."
Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it , eh ?
Can ' t ye see the world where you stand ?"
I was a little staggered , but go a - whaling I must , and I would ; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any -- I thought the best -- and all this I now repeated to Peleg .
For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale - hunters .
Nor will it at all detract from him , dramatically regarded , if either by birth or other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature .
He never used to swear , though , at his men , they said ; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel , unmitigated hard work out of them .
When Bildad was a chief - mate , to have his drab - coloured eye intently looking at you , made you feel completely nervous , till you could clutch something -- a hammer or a marling - spike , and go to work like mad , at something or other , never mind what .
" Bildad ," cried Captain Peleg , " at it again , Bildad , eh ?
said Peleg .
Peleg now threw open a chest , and drawing forth the ship ' s articles , placed pen and ink before him , and seated himself at a little table .
I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages ; but all hands , including the captain , received certain shares of the profits called lays , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship ' s company .
It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune -- and so it was , a very poor way indeed .
" Seven hundred and seventy - seventh ," again said Bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling --" for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also ."
roared Peleg , starting up and clattering about the cabin .
My jack - knife here needs the grindstone .
" What lay does he want ?"
turning to me .
" Yes , but I should like to see him ."
In fact , he ain ' t sick ; but no , he isn ' t well either .
' Twas a foolish , ignorant whim of his crazy , widowed mother , who died when he was only a twelvemonth old .
Towards evening , when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over , I went up to his room and knocked at the door ; but no answer .
" Queequeg ," said I softly through the key - hole :-- all silent .
I looked through the key - hole ; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room , the key - hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one .
Apoplexy !
But I thought , may be , you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping .
apoplexy !"
-- and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty - handed , when Mrs . Hussey interposed the mustard - pot and vinegar - cruet , and the entire castor of her countenance .
" Get the axe !
-- and with that she seized my arm .
Queequeg ' s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within .
" Queequeg ," said I , going up to him , " Queequeg , what ' s the matter with you ?"
said the landlady .
Think of it ; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary , unaccountable Ramadan !
But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window , up he got , with stiff and grating joints , but with a cheerful look ; limped towards me where I lay ; pressed his forehead again against mine ; and said his Ramadan was over .
In one word , Queequeg , said I , rather digressively ; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple - dumpling ; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans .
He said no ; only upon one memorable occasion .
It was after a great feast given by his father the king , on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o ' clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and eaten that very evening .
At last we rose and dressed ; and Queequeg , taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts , so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan , we sallied out to board the Pequod , sauntering along , and picking our teeth with halibut bones .
" I mean ," he replied , " he must show his papers ."
" First Congregational Church ," cried Bildad , " what !
" Splice , thou mean ' st SPLICE hands ," cried Peleg , drawing nearer .
You see him ?
" Quick , I say , you Bildad , and get the ship ' s papers .
We must have Hedgehog there , I mean Quohog , in one of our boats .
When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing , he turned to me and said , " I guess , Quohog there don ' t know how to write , does he ?
I say , Quohog , blast ye !
But at this question , Queequeg , who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies , looked no ways abashed ; but taking the offered pen , copied upon the paper , in the proper place , an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm ; so that through Captain Peleg ' s obstinate mistake touching his appellative , it stood something like this :--
Tell me , when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan , that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab , did ' st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then ?"
Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch , or save an end of tarred twine , which otherwise might have been wasted .
" About what ?"
" Oh , perhaps you hav ' n ' t got any ," he said quickly .
said I .
" That ' s true , that ' s true -- yes , both true enough .
But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn , long ago , when he lay like dead for three days and nights ; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa ?-- heard nothing about that , eh ?
Not all Nantucket , I guess .
" My friend ," said I , " what all this gibberish of yours is about , I don ' t know , and I don ' t much care ; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head .
Morning to ye , shipmates , morning !
This relieved me ; and once more , and finally as it seemed to me , I pronounced him in my heart , a humbug .
A day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the Pequod .
Just so with whaling , which necessitates a three - years ' housekeeping upon the wide ocean , far from all grocers , costermongers , doctors , bakers , and bankers .
And though this also holds true of merchant vessels , yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen .
To these questions they would answer , that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; meantime , the two captains , Peleg and Bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage .
Do you know , Mr . Elijah , that I consider you a little impertinent ?"
We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans , and would prefer not to be detained ."
" Ye be , be ye ?
" Morning to ye !
he rejoined , again moving off .
At last , stepping on board the Pequod , we found everything in profound quiet , not a soul moving .
Going forward to the forecastle , we found the slide of the scuttle open .
" Gracious !
" Oh !
Get off , Queequeg !
" Aye , aye , ye are going in her , be ye ?
" What Captain ?-- Ahab ?"
Merry Christmas .
" No need of profane words , however great the hurry , Peleg ," said Bildad , " but away with thee , friend Starbuck , and do our bidding ."
Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage , Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter - deck , just as if they were to be joint - commanders at sea , as well as to all appearances in port .
As I hinted before , this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port ; and on board the Pequod , for thirty years , the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor .
-- was the next command , and the crew sprang for the handspikes .
I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up ; involuntarily I paused on my handspike , and told Queequeg to do the same , thinking of the perils we both ran , in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot .
he roared .
spring , thou chap with the red whiskers ; spring there , Scotch - cap ; spring , thou green pants .
The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight ; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant , vast curving icicles depended from the bows .
Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic , spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket , there was yet , it then seemed to me , many a pleasant haven in store ; and meads and glades so eternally vernal , that the grass shot up by the spring , untrodden , unwilted , remains at midsummer .
At last we gained such an offing , that the two pilots were needed no longer .
For loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy Capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good - bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him ,-- poor old Bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far - off unseen Eastern Continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face , as much as to say , " Nevertheless , friend Peleg , I can stand it ; yes , I can ."
Boat ahoy !
within the year .
Good - bye , good - bye !
But in that gale , the port , the land , is that ship ' s direst jeopardy ; she must fly all hospitality ; one touch of land , though it but graze the keel , would make her shudder through and through .
With all her might she crowds all sail off shore ; in so doing , fights ' gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed sea ' s landlessness again ; for refuge ' s sake forlornly rushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe !
Terrors of the terrible !
Bear thee grimly , demigod !
Butchers we are , that is true .
But even granting the charge in question to be true ; what disordered slippery decks of a whale - ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle - fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies ' plaudits ?
for almost all the tapers , lamps , and candles that burn round the globe , burn , as before so many shrines , to our glory !
of France , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk , and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket ?
It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown , touching those colonies ; and , if space permitted , it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru , Chili , and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain , and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts .
If that double - bolted land , Japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale - ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold .
And who composed the first narrative of a whaling - voyage ?
And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament ?
WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE ?
Oh , that ' s only nominal !
There is a saltcellar of state , so called , and there may be a castor of state .
" Aye , aye ," said Stubb , the second mate , " Starbuck , there , is as careful a man as you ' ll find anywhere in this fishery ."
Besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be foolishly wasted .
For , thought Starbuck , I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living , and not to be killed by them for theirs ; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew .
With memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain superstitiousness , as has been said ; the courage of this Starbuck which could , nevertheless , still flourish , must indeed have been extreme .
But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance , the complete abasement of poor Starbuck ' s fortitude , scarce might I have the heart to write it ; for it is a thing most sorrowful , nay shocking , to expose the fall of valour in the soul .
Knights and Squires .
So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ; that in his poor opinion , the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse , or at least water - rat , requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil .
And since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a Gothic Knight of old , is always accompanied by his boat - steerer or harpooneer , who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or elbowed in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally subsists between the two , a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the Pequod ' s harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged .
To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs , you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans , and half - believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air .
Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them ring - bolts , and would talk of securing the top - sail halyards to them .
And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa , Nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues , and erect as a giraffe , moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks .
No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores , where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores .
CHAPTER 28
The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches , and for aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship ; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory , that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously .
It was one of those less lowering , but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition , when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity , that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch , so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail , foreboding shivers ran over me .
Nevertheless , ere long , the warm , warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant , holiday weather we came to , seemed gradually to charm him from his mood .
For , as when the red - cheeked , dancing girls , April and May , trip home to the wintry , misanthropic woods ; even the barest , ruggedest , most thunder - cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts , to welcome such glad - hearted visitants ; so Ahab did , in the end , a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air .
It was so with Ahab ; only that now , of late , he seemed so much to live in the open air , that truly speaking , his visits were more to the cabin , than from the cabin to the planks .
" Am I a cannon - ball , Stubb ," said Ahab , " that thou wouldst wad me that fashion ?
" Then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule , and an ass , and begone , or I ' ll clear the world of thee !"
It ' s queer ; very queer ; and he ' s queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he ' s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with .
How he flashed at me !-- his eyes like powder - pans !
A hot old man !
Damn me , it ' s worth a fellow ' s while to be born into the world , if only to fall right asleep .
But how ' s that ?
Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out .
how ?
hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone !
Here have I been unconsciously toiling , not pleasuring -- aye , and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while ; to windward , and with such nervous whiffs , as if , like the dying whale , my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble .
The fire hissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made .
CHAPTER 31
Yes ,' thinks I , ' it was only a playful cudgelling -- in fact , only a whaleboning that he gave me -- not a base kick .
man , but I was frightened .
But , somehow , next moment I was over the fright .
Says I , on second thoughts , ' I guess I won ' t kick you , old fellow .'
I snored ; rolled over ; and there I was in my hammock !
But it ' s made a wise man of me , Flask .
What ' s that he shouts ?
" Mast - head , there !
ain ' t there a small drop of something queer about that , eh ?
Stand by for it , Flask .
CHAPTER 32
Cetology .
Ere that come to pass ; ere the Pequod ' s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan ; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow .
" No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology ," says Captain Scoresby , A . D . 1820 .
" Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters ."
" Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea ."
I mean Captain Scoresby .
On the separate subject of the Greenland or right - whale , he is the best existing authority .
But the time has at last come for a new proclamation .
" Will he the ( leviathan ) make a covenant with thee ?
But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans ; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; I am in earnest ; and I will try .
However contracted , that definition is the result of expanded meditation .
By the above definition of what a whale is , I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien .
As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE ; of the OCTAVO , the GRAMPUS ; of the DUODECIMO , the PORPOISE .
FOLIOS .
He is , without doubt , the largest inhabitant of the globe ; the most formidable of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and lastly , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is obtained .
Philologically considered , it is absurd .
( RIGHT WHALE ).-- In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man .
What then is the whale , which I include in the second species of my Folios ?
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas ; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean , on the Brazil Banks , on the Nor ' West Coast , and various other parts of the world , designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds .
It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences , that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate .
From having the baleen in his mouth , the Fin - Back is sometimes included with the right whale , among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES , that is , whales with baleen .
Then , this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the similitude ceases .
BOOK I .
He has been frequently captured there , and towed into harbor .
I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn .
Of a retiring nature , he eludes both hunters and philosophers .
He is never chased ; he would run away with rope - walks of line .
Thus ends BOOK I .
( GRAMPUS ).-- Though this fish , whose loud sonorous breathing , or rather blowing , has furnished a proverb to landsmen , is so well known a denizen of the deep , yet is he not popularly classed among whales .
So , call him the Hyena Whale , if you please .
When not more profitably employed , the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale , to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment -- as some frugal housekeepers , in the absence of company , and quite alone by themselves , burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax .
But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct .
BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER IV .
From what I have seen of him at a distance , I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus .
He mounts the Folio whale ' s back , and as he swims , he works his passage by flogging him ; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process .
DUODECIMOES .-- These include the smaller whales .
The Huzza Porpoise .
They are the lads that always live before the wind .
But the next time you have a chance , watch him ; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature .
( ALGERINE PORPOISE ).-- A pirate .
I have lowered for him many times , but never yet saw him captured .
The only English name , by which he has hitherto been designated , is that of the fishers -- Right - Whale Porpoise , from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio .
In shape , he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise , being of a less rotund and jolly girth ; indeed , he is of quite a neat and gentleman - like figure .
Beyond the DUODECIMO , this system does not proceed , inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales .
From Icelandic , Dutch , and old English authorities , there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales , blessed with all manner of uncouth names .
This whole book is but a draught -- nay , but the draught of a draught .
The large importance attached to the harpooneer ' s vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old Dutch Fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder .
Indeed , many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter - deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot - cloth .
That certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship .
For be a man ' s intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base .
When the last echo of his sultan ' s step has died away , and Starbuck , the first Emir , has every reason to suppose that he is seated , then Starbuck rouses from his quietude , takes a few turns along the planks , and , after a grave peep into the binnacle , says , with some touch of pleasantness , " Dinner , Mr . Stubb ," and descends the scuttle .
But the third Emir , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter - deck , seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint ; for , tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions , and kicking off his shoes , he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk ' s head ; and then , by a dexterous sleight , pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf , he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck , reversing all other processions , by bringing up the rear with music .
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below , he pauses , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab ' s presence , in the character of Abjectus , or the Slave .
Least of all , did Flask presume to help himself to butter .
For hereby Flask ' s dinner was badly jammed in point of time .
They dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices .
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego , opposing his filed teeth to the Indian ' s : crosswise to them , Daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his hearse - plumed head to the low carlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin framework to shake , as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship .
Admiral Nelson , also , on a capstan of gun - metal , stands his mast - head in Trafalgar Square ; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire .
There you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes .
In one of those southern whalesmen , on a long three or four years ' voyage , as often happens , the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast - head would amount to several entire months .
Here , tossed about by the sea , the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull ' s horns .
To be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch - coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch - coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and cannot freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing ( like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter ); so a watch - coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you .
Concerning all this , it is much to be deplored that the mast - heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits , called CROW ' S - NESTS , in which the look - outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas .
On the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker underneath for umbrellas , comforters , and coats .
In front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , telescope , and other nautical conveniences .
When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast - head in this crow ' s - nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him ( also fixed in the rack ), together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing .
Let me make a clean breast of it here , and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard .
Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye ; given to unseasonable meditativeness ; and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head .
They have left their opera - glasses at home .
In this enchanted mood , thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came ; becomes diffused through time and space ; like Crammer ' s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes , forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over .
( ENTER AHAB : THEN , ALL )
" Sing out for him !"
" And what do ye next , men ?"
" All ye mast - headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale .
Mr . Starbuck , hand me yon top - maul ."
" Captain Ahab ," said Tashtego , " that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick ."
" Does he fan - tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ?"
and I ' ll chase him round Good Hope , and round the Horn , and round the Norway Maelstrom , and round perdition ' s flames before I give him up .
" Aye , aye !"
He tasks me ; he heaps me ; I see in him outrageous strength , with an inscrutable malice sinewing it .
But look ye , Starbuck , what is said in heat , that thing unsays itself .
Let it go .
The Pagan leopards -- the unrecking and unworshipping things , that live ; and seek , and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel !
Stand up amid the general hurricane , thy one tost sapling cannot , Starbuck !
the billow lifts thee !
Speak , but speak !-- Aye , aye !
" God keep me !-- keep us all !"
For again Starbuck ' s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before .
" The measure !
Then ranging them before him near the capstan , with their harpoons in their hands , while his three mates stood at his side with their lances , and the rest of the ship ' s company formed a circle round the group ; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew .
only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian .
Round with it , round !
boy , come back ?
So saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , radiating lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and nervously twitched them ; meanwhile , glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb ; from Stubb to Flask .
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright .
Perchance , too , it would have dropped ye dead .
Down lances !
Disdain the task ?
What , when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ?
take them ; hold them while I fill !"
drink and swear , ye men that man the deathful whaleboat ' s bow -- Death to Moby Dick !
The long , barbed steel goblets were lifted ; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale , the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss .
Yonder , by ever - brimming goblet ' s rim , the warm waves blush like wine .
The diver sun -- slow dived from noon -- goes down ; my soul mounts up !
this Iron Crown of Lombardy .
Yet is it bright with many a gem ; I the wearer , see not its far flashings ; but darkly feel that I wear that , that dazzlingly confounds .
This lovely light , it lights not me ; all loveliness is anguish to me , since I can ne ' er enjoy .
What I ' ve dared , I ' ve willed ; and what I ' ve willed , I ' ll do !
No , ye ' ve knocked me down , and I am up again ; but YE have run and hidden .
Over unsounded gorges , through the rifled hearts of mountains , under torrents ' beds , unerringly I rush !
But he drilled deep down , and blasted all my reason out of me !
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in , as the small gold - fish has its glassy globe .
Oh , God !
ye revellers , and set the watch !
and with the soft feeling of the human in me , yet will I try to fight ye , ye grim , phantom futures !
Fore - Top .
clear my throat !-- I ' ve been thinking over it ever since , and that ha , ha ' s the final consequence .
I twigged it , knew it ; had had the gift , might readily have prophesied it -- for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it .
I feel funny .

Fine prospects to ' em ; they ' re on the road to heaven .
and only this evening -- it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine -- that anaconda of an old man swore ' em in to hunt him !
Oh , thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness , have mercy on this small black boy down here ; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear !
Moby Dick .
In that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded .
And as for those who , previously hearing of the White Whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species .
But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work .
Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier ' s , were these or almost similar impressions effaced .
And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters .
That to attempt it , would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity .
On this head , there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted .
It is a thing well known to both American and English whale - ships , and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas .
More than all , his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else .
And then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle - shaped lower jaw beneath him , Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab ' s leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field .
The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung .
That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one - half of the worlds ; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ;-- Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it .
It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment .
Then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , passionate , corporal animosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration , but nothing more .
Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand -- however grand and wonderful , now quit it ;-- and take your way , ye nobler , sadder souls , to those vast Roman halls of Thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man ' s upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique buried beneath antiquities , and throned on torsoes !
So with a broken throne , the great gods mock that captive king ; so like a Caryatid , he patient sits , upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages .
Wind ye down there , ye prouder , sadder souls !
And so too , all the added moodiness which always afterwards , to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage , sat brooding on his brow .
Here , then , was this grey - headed , ungodly old man , chasing with curses a Job ' s whale round the world , at the head of a crew , too , chiefly made up of mongrel renegades , and castaways , and cannibals -- morally enfeebled also , by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right - mindedness in Starbuck , the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb , and the pervading mediocrity in Flask .
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me .
* With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast .
A goney , he replied .
never !
Whisper it not , and I will tell ; with a treacherous hook and line , as the fowl floated on the sea .
What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye , as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin !
The Albino is as well made as other men -- has no substantive deformity -- and yet this mere aspect of all - pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion .
Nor , in some things , does the common , hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue .
Though thousands of miles from Oregon , still when he smells that savage musk , the rending , goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies , which this instant they may be trampling into dust .
Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt ?
CHAPTER 43

Look to the bucket !"
" Say what ye will , shipmate ; I ' ve sharp ears ."

The Chart .
Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed - down table .
At intervals , he would refer to piles of old log - books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen .
*
By that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion ; and portions of it are presented in the circular .
" This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude ; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months ; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines ; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district , and the two others to show the number of days in which whales , sperm or right , have been seen ."
And hence not only at substantiated times , upon well known separate feeding - grounds , could Ahab hope to encounter his prey ; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could , by his art , so place and time himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting .
There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme .
Therefore , he must wait for the next ensuing season .
But granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white - bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople ?
So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book ; and , indeed , as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales , the foregoing chapter , in its earlier part , is as important a one as will be found in this volume ; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon , in order to be adequately understood , and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds , as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair .
I care not to perform this part of my task methodically ; but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items , practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman ; and from these citations , I take it -- the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself .
Meanwhile , the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels ; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe , brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa ; but to no purpose .
Here are three instances , then , which I personally know the truth of ; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach .
Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man , they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street , lest if they pursued the acquaintance further , they might receive a summary thump for their presumption .
But this is not all .
Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific , among many others we spoke thirty different ships , every one of which had had a death by a whale , some of them more than one , and three that had each lost a boat ' s crew .
One day she saw spouts , lowered her boats , and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales .
Again : " At all events , the whole circumstances taken together , all happening before my own eyes , and producing , at the time , impressions in my mind of decided , calculating mischief , on the part of the whale ( many of which impressions I cannot now recall ), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion ."
He peremptorily denied for example , that any whale could so smite his stout sloop - of - war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful .
I tell you , the sperm whale will stand no nonsense .
Langsdorff , you must know by the way , was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern ' s famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century .
Of what precise species this sea - monster was , is not mentioned .
In the Propontis , as far as I can learn , none of that peculiar substance called BRIT is to be found , the aliment of the right whale .
But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale -- squid or cuttle - fish -- lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface .
If , then , you properly put these statements together , and reason upon them a bit , you will clearly perceive that , according to all human reasoning , Procopius ' s sea - monster , that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor , must in all probability have been a sperm whale .
Surmises .
He knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the purely spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation .
Not only that , but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that , for the present , the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background ( for few men ' s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action ); that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick .
For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable -- they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness -- and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however promissory of life and passion in the end , it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash .
From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation , and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground , Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself .
Be all this as it may , his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast - heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look - out , and not omit reporting even a porpoise .
The straight warp of necessity , not to be swerved from its ultimate course -- its every alternating vibration , indeed , only tending to that ; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads ; and chance , though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its motions directed by free will , though thus prescribed to by both , chance by turns rules either , and has the last featuring blow at events .
High aloft in the cross - trees was that mad Gay - Header , Tashtego .
there !
there !
there !
" Time !
With a start all glared at dark Ahab , who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air .
CHAPTER 48
The phantoms , for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the deck , and , with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there .
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel - like lips .
But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban , the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head .
addressing his crew .
They are only five more hands come to help us -- never mind from where -- the more the merrier .
So , so ; there you are now ; that ' s the stroke for a thousand pounds ; that ' s the stroke to sweep the stakes !
Why don ' t you snap your oars , you rascals ?
So , so , so , then :-- softly , softly !
long and strong .
Give way there , give way !
The devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep .
Stop snoring , ye sleepers , and pull .
Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger - cakes don ' t ye pull ?-- pull and break something !
It ain ' t the White Whale to - day !
Meantime , Ahab , out of hearing of his officers , having sided the furthest to windward , was still ranging ahead of the other boats ; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him .
Will you mount ?"
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious ; for sustaining himself with a cool , indifferent , easy , unthought of , barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form .
He loaded it , and rammed home the loading with his thumb - end ; but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand , when Tashtego , his harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars , suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat , crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry , " Down , down all , and give way !-- there they are !"
But it bade fair to outstrip them ; it flew on and on , as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills .
" Sing out and say something , my hearties .
Lay me on -- lay me on !
yes , give him fits -- that ' s the very word -- pitch fits into ' em .
Only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more .
Take it easy -- why don ' t ye take it easy , I say , and burst all your livers and lungs !"
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger - yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land .
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words , when , with tornado brow , and eyes of red murder , and foam - glued lips , Ahab leaped after his prey .
The repeated specific allusions of Flask to " that whale ," as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat ' s bow with its tail -- these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life - like , that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder .
But this was against all rule ; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes , and ram a skewer through their necks ; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears , and no limbs but arms , in these critical moments .
It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe !
The jets of vapour no longer blended , but tilted everywhere to right and left ; the whales seemed separating their wakes .
Though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed .
Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places .
The wind increased to a howl ; the waves dashed their bucklers together ; the whole squall roared , forked , and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie , in which , unconsumed , we were burning ; immortal in these jaws of death !
The Hyena .
" Mr . Flask ," said I , turning to little King - Post , who was standing close by ; " you are experienced in these things , and I am not .
" Queequeg ," said I , " come along , you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee ."
I survived myself ; my death and burial were locked up in my chest .
Ahab ' s Boat and Crew .
Fedallah .
" Who would have thought it , Flask !"
Lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea .
And had you watched Ahab ' s face that night , you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring .
But calm , snow - white , and unvarying ; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried .
Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists .
Never could Starbuck forget the old man ' s aspect , when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood , he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor - screwed chair ; the rain and half - melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged , still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat .
His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand .
CHAPTER 52
South - eastward from the Cape , off the distant Crozetts , a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen , a sail loomed ahead , the Goney ( Albatross ) by name .
A wild sight it was to see her long - bearded look - outs at those three mast - heads .
They seemed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising .
Have ye seen the White Whale ?"
But as the strange captain , leaning over the pallid bulwarks , was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth , it somehow fell from his hand into the sea ; and the wind now rising amain , he in vain strove to make himself heard without it .
" Swim away from me , do ye ?"
There seemed but little in the words , but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced .
The Gam .
But even had this not been the case , he would not after all , perhaps , have boarded her -- judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -- if so it had been that , by the process of hailing , he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put .
Besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat .
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with Americans and English .
She has a " GAM ," a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about " spouters " and " blubber - boilers ," and such like pretty exclamations .
You might wear out your index - finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries , and never find the word .
There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here .
The Cape of Good Hope , and all the watery region round about there , is much like some noted four corners of a great highway , where you meet more travellers than in any other part .
It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward - bound whaleman , the Town - Ho ,* was encountered .
It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship , one of whom , it seems , communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy , but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep , and revealed so much of it in that way , that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest .
But the captain , having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very averse to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by , and not only was the leak yet undiscovered , but it sensibly increased .
Now , gentlemen , in square - sail brigs and three - masted ships , well - nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla ; this Lakeman , in the land - locked heart of our America , had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean .
At all events , he had proved so thus far ; but Radney was doomed and made mad , and Steelkilt -- but , gentlemen , you shall hear .
" Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings .
If old Rad were here now , I ' d tell him to jump overboard and scatter ' em .
' Thunder away at it !'
And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire - engines ; the men tossed their hats off to it , and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life ' s utmost energies .
Intolerably striding along the deck , the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks , and also a shovel , and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large .
" Now , gentlemen , sweeping a ship ' s deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening ; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time .
Such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea - usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces .
Besides , it was the stronger men in the Town - Ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades .
"' Canallers !'
"' Aye ?
Well then , Don , refill my cup .
There ' s your true Ashantee , gentlemen ; there howl your pagans ; where you ever find them , next door to you ; under the long - flung shadow , and the snug patronising lee of churches .
For by some curious fatality , as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice , so sinners , gentlemen , most abound in holiest vicinities .
"' Well for our northern friend , Dame Isabella ' s Inquisition wanes in Lima ,' laughed Don Sebastian .
Mark !-- St .
Your cup !
"' I see !
' No need to travel !
But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass , these sea - Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade .
"' Turn to !'
roared the Captain .
Down ye go .'
cried the ringleader to his men .
Most of them were against it ; but at length , in obedience to Steelkilt , they preceded him down into their dark den , growlingly disappearing , like bears into a cave .
he cried , at last ; ' but there is still rope enough left for you , my fine bantam , that wouldn ' t give up .
"' But I must ,'-- and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke .
But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing -- namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered .
" But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct , he kept his own counsel ( at least till all was over ) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart .
He was in Radney the chief mate ' s watch ; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom , after the scene at the rigging , he insisted , against the express counsel of the captain , upon resuming the head of his watch at night .
Shipmate , I haven ' t enough twine ,-- have you any ?'
"' You don ' t mean to go a begging to HIM !'
and going to the mate , he looked at him quietly , and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock .
It was Moby Dick .
Sir sailor , but do whales have christenings ?
' The White Whale -- the White Whale !'
The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate , and when fast to a fish , it was his duty to sit next him , while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or slacken the line , at the word of command .
After taking counsel with his officers , he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the poop ; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale - boat , steered straight before the wind for Tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew .
and for what are you bound ?'
"' A pretty scholar ,' laughed the Lakeman .
"' Then I entreat you , tell me if to the best of your own convictions , this your story is in substance really true ?
Bear with me if I seem to press .'
I see no need of this .'
I know it to be true ; it happened on this ball ; I trod the ship ; I knew the crew ; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney .'"
It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo , Egyptian , and Grecian sculptures .
The Hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the Matse Avatar .
Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that ?
It has a sort of howdah on its back , and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling , might be taken for the Traitors ' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower .
What shall be said of these ?
Though universally denominated a dolphin , I nevertheless call this book - binder ' s fish an attempt at a whale ; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced .
In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged " whale " and a " narwhale ."
I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys .
Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , Desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a Chinese drawing .
And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are , many queer cups and saucers inform us .
In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it .
And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him .
CHAPTER 56
I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale ; Colnett ' s , Huggins ' s , Frederick Cuvier ' s , and Beale ' s .
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to .
Huggins ' s is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , Beale ' s is the best .
His frontispiece , boats attacking Sperm Whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life - like in its general effect .
But , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some details not the most correct , presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large French engravings , well executed , and taken from paintings by one Garnery .
Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety - six fac - similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals .
I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager ( I honour him for a veteran ), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace .
But , in general , they toil with their jack - knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner ' s fancy .
Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours , is his wonderful patience of industry .
Some of them are done with much accuracy .
At some old gable - roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road - side door .
In bony , ribby regions of the earth , where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain , you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass , which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges .
Yea , foolish mortals , Noah ' s flood is not yet subsided ; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers .
Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews , when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever ; yet not a modern sun ever sets , but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews .
Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs , so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks , and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships .
Consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure .
Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes , as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks .
In the distance , a great white mass lazily rose , and rising higher and higher , and disentangling itself from the azure , at last gleamed before our prow like a snow - slide , new slid from the hills .
said Flask .
There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid .
With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , I have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale - line .
Hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of Indian ; but Manilla is as a golden - haired Circassian to behold .
CHAPTER 61
And lo !
close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an Ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun ' s rays like a mirror .
All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use .
All alive to his jeopardy , he was going " head out "; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed .
Though apparently the most massive , it is by far the most buoyant part about him .
Start her !"
Wa - hee !"
But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild .
And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea .
wet the line !"
* More turns were taken , so that the line began holding its place .
The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill .
His heart had burst !
CHAPTER 62
The Dart .
For one , I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time .
CHAPTER 63
Nevertheless , as the second iron is already connected with the line , and the line is running , hence that weapon must , at all events , be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat , somehow and somewhere ; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands .
Tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line ( mentioned in a preceding chapter ) making this feat , in most instances , prudently practicable .
Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment , he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night , and then handing his lantern to a seaman , went his way into the cabin , and did not come forward again until morning .
Though , in overseeing the pursuit of this whale , Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague dissatisfaction , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object .
Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod ' s decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port - holes .
If moody Ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on deck , Stubb , his second mate , flushed with conquest , betrayed an unusual but still good - natured excitement .
One small , helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb , was soon made strangely manifest .
You , Daggoo !
How at such an apparently unassailable surface , they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls , remains a part of the universal problem of all things .
Sullenly taking the offered lantern , old Fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks ; and then , with one hand dropping his light low over the sea , so as to get a good view of his congregation , with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs , and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks , while Stubb , softly crawling behind , overheard all that was said .
Den preach to him yourself ," sullenly turning to go .
" Well , den , Belubed fellow - critters :"-
" Right !"
" Do you is all sharks , and by natur wery woracious , yet I zay to you , fellow - critters , dat dat woraciousness --' top dat dam slappin ' ob de tail !
I know some o ' you has berry brig mout , brigger dan oders ; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies ; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid , but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks , dat can ' t get into de scrouge to help demselves ."
Upon this , Fleece , holding both hands over the fishy mob , raised his shrill voice , and cried --
In the first place , how old are you , cook ?"
" And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years , cook , and don ' t know yet how to cook a whale - steak ?"
he cried sharply .
" When dis old brack man dies ," said the negro slowly , changing his whole air and demeanor , " he hisself won ' t go nowhere ; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him ."
" You said up there , didn ' t you ?
But , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber ' s hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you don ' t get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging .
Do ye hear ?
" Wish , by gor !
Also , that in Henry VIIIth ' s time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale .
They had a great porpoise grant from the crown .
We all know how they live upon whales , and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil .
They have such an eatable look that the most self - denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off .
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish , is his exceeding richness .
Nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it .
The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn ( precisely resembling two large puddings ), they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves ' head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves ' brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf ' s head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination .
And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf ' s head before him , is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see .
And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars ?
CHAPTER 66
In its socket , a stiff pole , from twenty to thirty feet long , is inserted for a handle .
And thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the heavers singing , the blubber - room gentlemen coiling , the mates scarfing , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general friction .
I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore .
The question is , what and where is the skin of the whale ?
It is transparent , as I said before ; and being laid upon the printed page , I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence .
That same infinitely thin , isinglass substance , which , I admit , invests the entire body of the whale , is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature , as the skin of the skin , so to speak ; for it were simply ridiculous to say , that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new - born child .
Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale ; then , when this skin , as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale , will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil ; and , when it is considered that , in quantity , or rather weight , that oil , in its expressed state , is only three fourths , and not the entire substance of the coat ; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass , a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that .
For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an Indian poncho slipt over his head , and skirting his extremity .
It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body , that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers , in all seas , times , and tides .
What would become of a Greenland whale , say , in those shuddering , icy seas of the North , if unsupplied with his cosy surtout ?
How wonderful is it then -- except after explanation -- that this great monster , to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man ; how wonderful that he should be found at home , immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters !
Do thou , too , live in this world without being of it .
The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre ; though changed in hue , it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk .
In life but few of them would have helped the whale , I ween , if peradventure he had needed it ; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce .
Oh , horrible vultureism of earth !
Bear in mind , too , that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh ; and in that subterraneous manner , without so much as getting one single peep into the ever - contracting gash thus made , he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent , interdicted parts , and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull .
But , with a full grown leviathan this is impossible ; for the sperm whale ' s head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk , and completely to suspend such a burden as that , even by the immense tackles of a whaler , this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers ' scales .
Taking a few turns on the quarter - deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the main - chains he took Stubb ' s long spade -- still remaining there after the whale ' s Decapitation -- and striking it into the lower part of the half - suspended mass , placed its other end crutch - wise under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head .
Where unrecorded names and navies rust , and untold hopes and anchors rot ; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned ; there , in that awful water - land , there was thy most familiar home .
O head !
" Three points on the starboard bow , sir , and bringing down her breeze to us !

The Pequod ' s signal was at last responded to by the stranger ' s setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket .
He was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair .
His story was this :
They engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship ' s getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a freshet .
The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things ;-- the dark , daring play of his sleepless , excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium , united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness .
Moreover , they were afraid of him .
Gabriel !"
cried Captain Mayhew ; " thou must either --" But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead , and its seethings drowned all speech .
Beware of the horrible tail !"
Meantime , the hoisted sperm whale ' s head jogged about very violently , and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant .
When this interlude was over , Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick ; not , however , without frequent interruptions from Gabriel , whenever his name was mentioned , and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him .
But when , some year or two afterwards , Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast - heads , Macey , the chief mate , burned with ardour to encounter him ; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity , despite all the archangel ' s denunciations and forewarnings , Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat .
Meantime , Gabriel , ascending to the main - royal mast - head , was tossing one arm in frantic gestures , and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity .
Next instant , the luckless mate , so full of furious life , was smitten bodily into the air , and making a long arc in his descent , fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards .
It is well to parenthesize here , that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm - Whale Fishery , this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any .
As , after this interlude , the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale , many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair .
It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene .
It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale ' s back , the blubber - hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates .
But in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded .
On the occasion in question , Queequeg figured in the Highland costume -- a shirt and socks -- in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen .
True , you may say that , by exceeding caution , you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life .
hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water !
" Will you look at that kannakin , sir ; smell of it , if you please ."
" Ginger - jub !
and run along with ye to the lockers , and get something better .
I hope I do no wrong , Mr . Starbuck .
When Stubb reappeared , he came with a dark flask in one hand , and a sort of tea - caddy in the other .
But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it .
And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures ; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all , and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat ; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded , to the surprise of all , the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day , if opportunity offered .
But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain .
" Why , do ye see , the old man is hard bent after that White Whale , and the devil there is trying to come round him , and get him to swap away his silver watch , or his soul , or something of that sort , and then he ' ll surrender Moby Dick ."
" Pooh !
" I don ' t know , Flask , but the devil is a curious chap , and a wicked one , I tell ye .
The devil , switching his hoofs , up and says , ' I want John .'
But now , tell me , Stubb , do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now , was the same you say is now on board the Pequod ?"
" Am I the same man that helped kill this whale ?
Tell me that , Mr .
" How old do you suppose Fedallah is , Stubb ?"
Nor all the coopers in creation couldn ' t show hoops enough to make oughts enough ."
" Duck him again ; and keep ducking him ."
Sell it for an ox whip when we get home ;-- what else ?"
In good time , Flask ' s saying proved true .
So , when on one side you hoist in Locke ' s head , you go over that way ; but now , on the other side , hoist in Kant ' s and you come back again ; but in very poor plight .
throw all these thunder - heads overboard , and then you will float light and right .
The carcases of both whales had dropped astern ; and the head - laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers .
Meantime , Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale ' s head , and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand .
And Ahab chanced so to stand , that the Parsee occupied his shadow ; while , if the Parsee ' s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with , and lengthen Ahab ' s .
As the crew toiled on , Laplandish speculations were bandied among them , concerning all these passing things .
The Sperm Whale ' s Head -- Contrasted View .
If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with dagger uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind .
Man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry - box with two joined sashes for his window .
This peculiarity of the whale ' s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery ; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes .
Nevertheless , any one ' s experience will teach him , that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to examine any two things -- however large or however small -- at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other .
Subtilize it .
Let us now with whatever levers and steam - engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale ' s head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach .
But far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right - angles with his body , for all the world like a ship ' s jib - boom .
In most cases this lower jaw -- being easily unhinged by a practised artist -- is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth , and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles , including canes , umbrella - stocks , and handles to riding - whips .
With a long , weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board , as if it were an anchor ; and when the proper time comes -- some few days after the other work -- Queequeg , Daggoo , and Tashtego , being all accomplished dentists , are set to drawing teeth .
Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker ' s last .
If you stand on its summit and look at these two F - shaped spoutholes , you would take the whole head for an enormous bass - viol , and these spiracles , the apertures in its sounding - board .
Then , again , if you fix your eye upon this strange , crested , comb - like incrustation on the top of the mass -- this green , barnacled thing , which the Greenlanders call the " crown ," and the Southern fishers the " bonnet " of the Right Whale ; fixing your eyes solely on this , you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak , with a bird ' s nest in its crotch .
Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable , yet it has the savor of analogical probability .
At any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable .
One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous " whiskers " inside of the whale ' s mouth ;* another , " hogs ' bristles "; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language : " There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper CHOP , which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth ."
* This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker , or rather a moustache , consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw .
And as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like thoughtlessness , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection ; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone .
For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey -- the tongue , which is glued , as it were , to the floor of the mouth .
Ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with -- that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads .
Look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following .
Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale ' s there ?
The Battering - Ram .
So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad .
In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange .
When two large , loaded Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks , what do the sailors do ?
But supplementary to this , it has hypothetically occurred to me , that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them , capable , at will , of distension or contraction ; and as the Sperm Whale , as far as I know , has no such provision in him ; considering , too , the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface , and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water ; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope ; considering the unique interior of his head ; it has hypothetically occurred to me , I say , that those mystical lung - celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air , so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction .
Unerringly impelling this dead , impregnable , uninjurable wall , and this most buoyant thing within ; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life , only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is -- by the cord ; and all obedient to one volition , as the smallest insect .
For unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth .
But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter ; how small the chances for the provincials then ?
A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides .
By the time this cautious search is over , a stout iron - bound bucket , precisely like a well - bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands .
Carefully lowered from its height , the full - freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub .
Looking over the side , they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk .
At this instant , while Daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip -- which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles -- a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg .
We thought the tissued , infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale , was the lightest and most corky part about him ; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself .
And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale .
A nose to the whale would have been impertinent .
This aspect is sublime .
Human or animal , the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees .
Physiognomy , like every other human science , is but a passing fable .
Unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base .
Indeed , place this reversed skull ( scaled down to the human magnitude ) among a plate of men ' s skulls , and you would involuntarily confound it with them ; and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit , in phrenological phrase you would say -- This man had no self - esteem , and no veneration .
And by those negations , considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you can best form to yourself the truest , though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is .
But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale ' s proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then I have another idea for you .
Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale .
From its relative situation then , I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale .
The predestinated day arrived , and we duly met the ship Jungfrau , Derick De Deer , master , of Bremen .
At one time the greatest whaling people in the world , the Dutch and Germans are now among the least ; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude , you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific .
For some reason , the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects .
However curious it may seem for an oil - ship to be borrowing oil on the whale - ground , and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle , yet sometimes such a thing really happens ; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp - feeder as Flask did declare .
His necessities supplied , Derick departed ; but he had not gained his ship ' s side , when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast - heads of both vessels ; and so eager for the chase was Derick , that without pausing to put his oil - can and lamp - feeder aboard , he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp - feeders .
They left a great , wide wake , as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea .
Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him , boys .
" Give way , or the German will have him ."
" The ungracious and ungrateful dog !"
cried Starbuck ; " he mocks and dares me with the very poor - box I filled for him not five minutes ago !"
Halloo , here ' s grass growing in the boat ' s bottom -- and by the Lord , the mast there ' s budding .
" Oh !
Oh !
Hurrah for the white - ash breeze !
Now to this hand , now to that , he yawed in his faltering flight , and still at every billow that he broke , he spasmodically sank in the sea , or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin .
Hurrah !
Every keel a sunbeam !
this whale carries the everlasting mail !"
With a grating rush , the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them ; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines , that using all their dexterous might , they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on ; till at last -- owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead - lined chocks of the boats , whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue -- the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water , while the three sterns tilted high in the air .
Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows .
this he ?
Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head !
The next moment , relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards , as a small icefield will , when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea .
Not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non - valvular structure of the blood - vessels , so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams .
It was his death stroke .
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly healed around them , and no prominence of any kind to denote their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to .
It might have been darted by some Nor ' West Indian long before America was discovered .
However , Starbuck , who had the ordering of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been capsized , if still persisting in locking arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the immovable strain upon the timber - heads to which the fluke - chains and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off .
Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places , by the unnatural dislocation .
No use prying there ; avast , I say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen - knife , and cut the big chains ."
But it is not so .
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale ; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free .
Nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale .
CHAPTER 83
Another reason which Sag - Harbor ( he went by that name ) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale ' s gastric juices .
Poor Sag - Harbor , therefore , seems worsted all round .
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean , and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days , not to speak of the Tigris waters , near the site of Nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in .
For by a Portuguese Catholic priest , this very idea of Jonah ' s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle .
Pitchpoling .
As a general thing , therefore , you must first get fast to a whale , before any pitchpoling comes into play .
Instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood .
Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface .
Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world .
Anomalous as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who systematically lives , by intervals , his full hour and more ( when at the bottom ) without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air ; for , remember , he has no gills .
This is what I mean .
How obvious is it , too , that this necessity for the whale ' s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase .
Not so much thy skill , then , O hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee !
In man , breathing is incessantly going on -- one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will .
But the Sperm Whale ' s food is far beneath the surface , and there he cannot spout even if he would .
Besides , if you regard him very closely , and time him with your watch , you will find that when unmolested , there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration .
You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it , and bring it away .
For even when coming into slight contact with the outer , vapoury shreds of the jet , which will often happen , your skin will feverishly smart , from the acridness of the thing so touching it .
Wherefore , among whalemen , the spout is deemed poisonous ; they try to evade it .
The wisest thing the investigator can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone .
Still , we can hypothesize , even if we cannot prove and establish .
The invariable moisture of my hair , while plunged in deep thought , after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic , of an August noon ; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition .
The compact round body of its root expands into two broad , firm , flat palms or flukes , gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness .
At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale , the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across .
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews ; but cut into it , and you find that three distinct strata compose it :-- upper , middle , and lower .
As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe , he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man , that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch .
And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son , the soft , curled , hermaphroditical Italian pictures , in which his idea has been most successfully embodied ; these pictures , so destitute as they are of all brawniness , hint nothing of any power , but the mere negative , feminine one of submission and endurance , which on all hands it is conceded , form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings .
Second : It is a little significant , that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw , nevertheless , in his conflicts with man , he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail .
In striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil .
If it be made in the unobstructed air , especially if it descend to its mark , the stroke is then simply irresistible .
Some one strips off a frock , and the hole is stopped .
Third : I cannot demonstrate it , but it seems to me , that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail ; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant ' s trunk .
Fourth : Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas , you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity , and kitten - like , he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth .
So in dreams , have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell .
As it seemed to me at the time , such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld , even in Persia , the home of the fire worshippers .
It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk , and then elevating it , jet it forth in a stream .
But if I know not even the tail of this whale , how understand his head ?
In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra , Java , Bally , and Timor ; which , with many others , form a vast mole , or rampart , lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia , and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes .
This rampart is pierced by several sally - ports for the convenience of ships and whales ; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca .
Unlike the Danes , these Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top - sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind , which for centuries past , by night and by day , have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java , freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east .
Nay .
For a long time , now , the circus - running sun has raced within his fiery ring , and needs no sustenance but what ' s in himself .
Unlike the straight perpendicular twin - jets of the Right Whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward - slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward .
As with glass under arm , Ahab to - and - fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above seemed his .
But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures .
Best , therefore , withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us , for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men .
Though many of the whales , as has been said , were in violent motion , yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated , but collectively remained in one place .
For then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time .
But sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can .
And if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure .
The first and second were successfully darted , and we saw the whales staggeringly running off , fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg .
Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales , were heard but not felt .
Yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion .
And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles , and saw successive pods of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like multiplied spans of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a Titanic circus - rider might easily have over - arched the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs .
Keeping at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves ; the women and children of this routed host .
Floating on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us .
One of these little infants , that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old , might have measured some fourteen feet in length , and some six feet in girth .
And thus , though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights , did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments ; yea , serenely revelled in dalliance and delight .
But even so , amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being , do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm ; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me , deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy .
But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles , was nothing to what at last met our eyes .
But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the harpoon - line that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting - spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon - line round his tail , the cutting - spade itself had worked loose from his flesh .
Shove him off , you Queequeg -- the whale there !-- prick him !-- hit him !
The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks , leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths .
After many similar hair - breadth escapes , we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles , but now crossed by random whales , all violently making for one centre .
Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement ; for having clumped together at last in one dense body , they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness .
The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the Fishery ,-- the more whales the less fish .
CHAPTER 88
Like fashionables , they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety .
By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile , they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there , and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year .
As ashore , the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers ; just so with the whales , who sometimes come to deadly battle , and all for love .
In good time , nevertheless , as the ardour of youth declines ; as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors .
Like venerable moss - bearded Daniel Boone , he will have no one near him but Nature herself ; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters , and the best of wives she is , though she keeps so many moody secrets .
The Forty - barrel - bull schools are larger than the harem schools .
Like a mob of young collegians , they are full of fight , fun , and wickedness , tumbling round the world at such a reckless , rollicking rate , that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard .
CHAPTER 89
Fast - Fish and Loose - Fish .
The allusion to the waif and waif - poles in the last chapter but one , necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge .
For example ,-- after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and drifting far away to leeward , be retaken by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly tows it alongside , without risk of life or line .
Yes ; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne ' s forthing , or the barb of a harpoon , and worn round the neck , so small are they .
But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it , which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it .
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do .
Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale - trover litigated in England , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas ; and when indeed they ( the plaintiffs ) had succeeded in harpooning the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to forsake not only their lines , but their boat itself .
In the course of the defence , the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position , by alluding to a recent crim .
What to that redoubted harpooneer , John Bull , is poor Ireland , but a Fast - Fish ?
What to that apostolic lancer , Brother Jonathan , is Texas but a Fast - Fish ?
But if the doctrine of Fast - Fish be pretty generally applicable , the kindred doctrine of Loose - Fish is still more widely so .
What Greece to the Turk ?
What is the great globe itself but a Loose - Fish ?
And what are you , reader , but a Loose - Fish and a Fast - Fish , too ?
Heads or Tails .
" De balena vero sufficit , si rex habeat caput , et regina caudam ."
Latin from the books of the Laws of England , which taken along with the context , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the King , as Honourary Grand Harpooneer , must have the head , and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail .
this fish , my masters , is a Fast - Fish .
" The Duke ."
" Won ' t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half ?"
Thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration .
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign .
In his treatise on " Queen - Gold ," or Queen - pinmoney , an old King ' s Bench author , one William Prynne , thus discourseth : " Ye tail is ye Queen ' s , that ye Queen ' s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone ."
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers -- the whale and the sturgeon ; both royal property under certain limitations , and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown ' s ordinary revenue .
" In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan , insufferable fetor denying not inquiry ."
" WHAT whale ?"
" I wish it was broken , or that I didn ' t have any nose at all !"
But joking aside , though ; do you know , Rose - bud , that it ' s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales ?
All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib - booms .
He therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him , so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain , without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity .
He was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a sea - captain , with large whiskers and moustache , however ; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch - seals at his side .
Instantly the captain ran forward , and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting - tackles , and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship .
" He says , Monsieur , that he ' s very happy to have been of any service to us ."
By this time Stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the Guernsey - man to this effect ,-- that having a long tow - line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship ' s side .
Seizing his sharp boat - spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin .
CHAPTER 92
Now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in 1791 a certain Nantucket - born Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject .
Besides , amber is a hard , transparent , brittle , odorless substance , used for mouth - pieces to pipes , for beads and ornaments ; but ambergris is soft , waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in pastiles , precious candles , hair - powders , and pomatum .
But there is another thing to rebut .
But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless .
The truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company , by the nose .
Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air .
ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy - jolly .
For blacks , the year ' s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty - five Fourth of Julys and New Year ' s Days .
roared Stubb ; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved .
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller ' s trunk .
Alas !
Out from the centre of the sea , poor Pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest .
But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable .
But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ?
The thing is common in that fishery ; and in the sequel of the narrative , it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself .
That whale of Stubb ' s , so dearly purchased , was duly brought to the Pequod ' s side , where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed , were regularly gone through , even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun , or Case .
A sweet and unctuous duty !
such a delicious molifier !
squeeze !
all the morning long ; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it ; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me ; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co - laborers ' hands in it , mistaking their hands for the gentle globules .
Such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget ; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands , and looking up into their eyes sentimentally ; as much as to say ,-- Oh !
Spite of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it .
There is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe .
Edgewise moved along the oily deck , it operates like a leathern squilgee ; and by nameless blandishments , as of magic , allures along with it all impurities .
This spade is sharp as hone can make it ; the spademan ' s feet are shoeless ; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him , like a sledge .
Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this post - mortemizing of the whale ; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass , pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange , enigmatical object , which you would have seen there , lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers .
Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along , and assisted by two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus , as the mariners call it , and with bowed shoulders , staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field .
This done he turns the pelt inside out , like a pantaloon leg ; gives it a good stretching , so as almost to double its diameter ; and at last hangs it , well spread , in the rigging , to dry .
The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling .
Immemorial to all his order , this investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the peculiar functions of his office .
Arrayed in decent black ; occupying a conspicuous pulpit ; intent on bible leaves ; what a candidate for an archbishopric , what a lad for a Pope were this mincer !

CHAPTER 96
During the night - watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap .
It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation .
These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron .
Off hatch , then , and start her .
You cook , fire the works ."
Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try - works has to be fed for a time with wood .
for his smoke is horrible to inhale , and inhale it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time .
Wrapped , for that interval , in darkness myself , I but the better saw the redness , the madness , the ghastliness of others .
But , spite of all this , I could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card , by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it .
what is the matter with me ?
To - morrow , in the natural sun , the skies will be bright ; those who glared like devils in the forking flames , the morn will show in far other , at least gentler , relief ; the glorious , golden , glad sun , the only true lamp -- all others but liars !
He burns , too , the purest of oil , in its unmanufactured , and , therefore , unvitiated state ; a fluid unknown to solar , lunar , or astral contrivances ashore .
CHAPTER 98
Stowing Down and Clearing Up .
my friends , but this is man - killing !
Yet this is life .
the metempsychosis !
Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter - deck , taking regular turns at either limit , the binnacle and mainmast ; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks , when most plunged in his mood , he was wont to pause in turn at each spot , and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him .
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night , wondering whose it was to be at last , and whether he would ever live to spend it .
" No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil ' s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday ," murmured Starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks .
Signs and wonders ; and the sun , he ' s always among ' em .
You ' ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts .
Signs and wonders , eh ?
Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs , and significant in wonders !
Come , Almanack !
To begin : there ' s Aries , or the Ram -- lecherous dog , he begets us ; then , Taurus , or the Bull -- he bumps us the first thing ; then Gemini , or the Twins -- that is , Virtue and Vice ; we try to reach Virtue , when lo !
comes Cancer the Crab , and drags us back ; and here , going from Virtue , Leo , a roaring Lion , lies in the path -- he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw ; we escape , and hail Virgo , the Virgin !
he ' s muttering -- voice like an old worn - out coffee - mill .
As I live he ' s comparing notes ; looking at his thigh bone ; thinks the sun is in the thigh , or in the calf , or in the bowels , I suppose , as the old women talk Surgeon ' s Astronomy in the back country .
But , aside again !
Ah , only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself ; there is a sun on the coin -- fire worshipper , depend upon it .
This way comes Pip -- poor boy !
" And I , you , and he ; and we , ye , and they , are all bats ; and I ' m a crow , especially when I stand a ' top of this pine tree here .
Caw !
caw !
caw !
Then again , if it stays here , that is ugly , too , for when aught ' s nailed to the mast it ' s a sign that things grow desperate .
Hish !
and cook us !
As good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved blubber - hook , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end .
" Spin me the yarn ," said Ahab ; " how was it ?"
" I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time .
" It was he , it was he !"
" How it was exactly ," continued the one - armed commander , " I do not know ; but in biting the line , it got foul of his teeth , caught there somehow ; but we didn ' t know it then ; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line , bounce we came plump on to his hump !
But a combing sea dashed me off , and at the same instant , the fish , taking one good dart forwards , went down like a flash ; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here " ( clapping his hand just below his shoulder ); " yes , caught me just here , I say , and bore me down to Hell ' s flames , I was thinking ; when , when , all of a sudden , thank the good God , the barb ript its way along the flesh -- clear along the whole length of my arm -- came out nigh my wrist , and up I floated ;-- and that gentleman there will tell you the rest ( by the way , captain -- Dr . Bunger , ship ' s surgeon : Bunger , my lad ,-- the captain ).
But , at his superior ' s introduction of him to Ahab , he politely bowed , and straightway went on to do his captain ' s bidding .
Oh !
cried the captain ; " he never drinks it ; it ' s a sort of fits to him ; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia ; but go on -- go on with the arm story ."
He flies into diabolical passions sometimes .
Oh , you solemn rogue , you -- you Bunger !
Bunger , when you die , you ought to die in pickle , you dog ; you should be preserved to future ages , you rascal ."
" Oh !"
" Twice ."
" Well , then ," interrupted Bunger , " give him your left arm for bait to get the right .
So that what you take for the White Whale ' s malice is only his awkwardness .
But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow , formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon , that making believe swallow jack - knives , once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest , and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more ; when I gave him an emetic , and he heaved it up in small tacks , d ' ye see .
Which way heading ?"
In a moment he was standing in the boat ' s stern , and the Manilla men were springing to their oars .
The Decanter .
A short life to them , and a jolly death .
Did I say we had flip ?
The bread -- but that couldn ' t be helped ; besides , it was an anti - scorbutic ; in short , the bread contained the only fresh fare they had .
But all in all , taking her from truck to helm , considering the dimensions of the cook ' s boilers , including his own live parchment boilers ; fore and aft , I say , the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship ; of good fare and plenty ; fine flip and strong ; crack fellows all , and capital from boot heels to hat - band .
I will tell you .
Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research , when it has seemed needed .
The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders , Zealanders , and Danes ; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old fashions , touching plenty to eat and drink .
of beef .
150 , 000 lbs .
550 , 000 lbs .
of biscuit .
2 , 800 firkins of butter .
20 , 000 lbs .
cheese ( probably an inferior article ).
10 , 800 barrels of beer .
At the time , I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me , capable of a transcendental and Platonic application ; and , furthermore , I compiled supplementary tables of my own , touching the probable quantity of stock - fish , etc ., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery .
I impute it , though , to their naturally unctuous natures , being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas , on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil .
The quantity of beer , too , is very large , 10 , 800 barrels .
And this empties the decanter .
A Bower in the Arsacides .
How is it , that you , a mere oarsman in the fishery , pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale ?
Among many other fine qualities , my royal friend Tranquo , being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu , had brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent ; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices , chiselled shells , inlaid spears , costly paddles , aromatic canoes ; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders , the wonder - freighted , tribute - rendering waves had cast upon his shores .
Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale , which , after an unusually long raging gale , had been found dead and stranded , with his head against a cocoa - nut tree , whose plumage - like , tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet .
For even so it is in all material factories .
Thereby have villainies been detected .
then , be heedful ; for so , in all this din of the great world ' s loom , thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar .
Now , amid the green , life - restless loom of that Arsacidean wood , the great , white , worshipped skeleton lay lounging -- a gigantic idler !
Now , when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale , and saw the skull an altar , and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued , I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu .
I saw no living thing within ; naught was there but bones .
But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them , concerning feet and inches ; they cracked each other ' s sconces with their yard - sticks -- the great skull echoed -- and seizing that lucky chance , I quickly concluded my own admeasurements .
But as I was crowded for space , and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing -- at least , what untattooed parts might remain -- I did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale .
To me this vast ivory - ribbed chest , with the long , unrelieved spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new - laid upon the stocks , when only some twenty of her naked bow - ribs are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , disconnected timber .
The ribs were ten on a side .
In considering these ribs , I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so variously repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form .
How vain and foolish , then , thought I , for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood .
Only in the heart of quickest perils ; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes ; only on the profound unbounded sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out .
For that , the best way we can consider it is , with a crane , to pile its bones high up on end .
The largest , a middle one , is in width something less than three feet , and in depth more than four .
The smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in width , and looks something like a white billiard - ball .
Would you , you could not compress him .
Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail , and the yards he measures about the waist ; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines , where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop - deck of a line - of - battle - ship .
One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one .
For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan , they weary me , and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep , as if to include the whole circle of the sciences , and all the generations of whales , and men , and mastodons , past , present , and to come , with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth , and throughout the whole universe , not excluding its suburbs .
We expand to its bulk .
Likewise , by way of preliminary , I desire to remind the reader , that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct ; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting , or at any rate intercepted links , between the antichronical creatures , and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark ; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period , which is the last preceding the superficial formations .
Detached broken fossils of pre - adamite whales , fragments of their bones and skeletons , have within thirty years past , at various intervals , been found at the base of the Alps , in Lombardy , in France , in England , in Scotland , and in the States of Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama .
The awe - stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels .
But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre - adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature , and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust ; but upon Egyptian tablets , whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character , we find the unmistakable print of his fin .
But the truth of the Matter is , that on either side of the Temple , there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea , and wound the Whales when they light upon ' em .
This Rib ( says John Leo ) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it .
In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you , reader , and if you be a Nantucketer , and a whaleman , you will silently worship there .
But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods ; may it not be , that since Adam ' s time they have degenerated ?
Whether owing to the almost omniscient look - outs at the mast - heads of the whaleships , now penetrating even through Behring ' s straits , and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world ; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts ; the moot point is , whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase , and so remorseless a havoc ; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters , and the last whale , like the last man , smoke his last pipe , and then himself evaporate in the final puff .
Whereas , in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West , when the far west ( in whose sunset suns still rise ) was a wilderness and a virgin , the same number of moccasined men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more buffaloes ; a fact that , if need were , could be statistically stated .
Furthermore : concerning these last mentioned Leviathans , they have two firm fortresses , which , in all human probability , will for ever remain impregnable .
And what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by imagining all the grave - yards , cemeteries , and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive seventy - five years ago ; and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe .
He swam the seas before the continents broke water ; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries , and Windsor Castle , and the Kremlin .
Captain Peleg ' s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate ; though , indeed , as touching all Ahab ' s deeper part , every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light .
So that , through their zeal for him , they had all conspired , so far as in them lay , to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others ; and hence it was , that not till a considerable interval had elapsed , did it transpire upon the Pequod ' s decks .
CHAPTER 107
Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn , and take high abstracted man alone ; and he seems a wonder , a grandeur , and a woe .
Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation .
Yet was this half - horrible stolidity in him , involving , too , as it appeared , an all - ramifying heartlessness ;-- yet was it oddly dashed at times , with an old , crutch - like , antediluvian , wheezing humorousness , not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness ; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah ' s ark .
CHAPTER 108
SLABS OF IVORY , LEATHER STRAPS , PADS , SCREWS , AND VARIOUS TOOLS OF ALL SORTS LYING ABOUT THE BENCH .
FORWARD , THE RED FLAME OF THE FORGE IS SEEN , WHERE THE BLACKSMITH IS AT WORK .)
Aye , now , this works better ( SNEEZES ).
Halloa , this bone dust is ( SNEEZES )-- why it ' s ( SNEEZES )-- yes it ' s ( SNEEZES )-- bless my soul , it won ' t let me speak !
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber .
Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I ' ve seen in shop windows wouldn ' t compare at all .
Ha !
that ' s the heel ; we are in luck ; here he comes , or it ' s somebody else , that ' s certain .
AHAB ( ADVANCING )
About it !
This is a cogent vice thou hast here , carpenter ; let me feel its grip once .
I do deem it now a most meaning thing , that that old Greek , Prometheus , who made men , they say , should have been a blacksmith , and animated them with fire ; for what ' s made in fire must properly belong to fire ; and so hell ' s probable .
I thought , sir , that you spoke to carpenter .
Sir ?-- oh !
Look ye , carpenter , I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman , eh ?
Hold , don ' t speak !
Here I am , proud as Greek god , and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on !
What was that now about one leg standing in three places , and all three places standing in one hell -- how was that ?
What a leg this is !
CHAPTER 109
no inconsiderable oil came up with the water ; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak .
*
And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him ; and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands -- Niphon , Matsmai , and Sikoke .
We must up Burtons and break out ."
" So it is , so it is ; if we get it ."
" And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all .
Begone !
Owners , owners ?
Thou art always prating to me , Starbuck , about those miserly owners , as if the owners were my conscience .
And I do dare , sir -- to be forbearing !
" Thou art but too good a fellow , Starbuck ," he said lowly to the mate ; then raising his voice to the crew : " Furl the t ' gallant - sails , and close - reef the top - sails , fore and aft ; back the main - yard ; up Burton , and break out in the main - hold ."
CHAPTER 110
Tierce after tierce , too , of water , and bread , and beef , and shooks of staves , and iron bundles of hoops , were hoisted out , till at last the piled decks were hard to get about ; and the hollow hull echoed under foot , as if you were treading over empty catacombs , and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air - freighted demijohn .
Not a man of the crew but gave him up ; and , as for Queequeg himself , what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked .
" Ah !
The head part turned over with a leather hinge , and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view .
" Poor rover !
will ye never have done with all this weary roving ?
where go ye now ?
But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water - lilies , will ye do one little errand for me ?
Seek out one Pip , who ' s now been missing long : I think he ' s in those far Antilles .
Rig - a - dig , dig , dig !
Now , Queequeg , die ; and I ' ll beat ye your dying march ."
So , to my fond faith , poor Pip , in this strange sweetness of his lunacy , brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes .
Hark ye ; if ye find Pip , tell all the Antilles he ' s a runaway ; a coward , a coward , a coward !
I ' d never beat my tambourine over base Pip , and hail him General , if he were once more dying here .
CHAPTER 111
And meet it is , that over these sea - pastures , wide - rolling watery prairies and Potters ' Fields of all four continents , the waves should rise and fall , and ebb and flow unceasingly ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , somnambulisms , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like slumberers in their beds ; the ever - rolling waves but made so by their restlessness .
the White Whale spouts thick blood !"
Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this ; but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried ; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote , the Wild , the Watery , the Unshored ; therefore , to the death - longing eyes of such men , who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide , does the all - contributed and all - receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable , taking terrors , and wonderful , new - life adventures ; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics , the thousand mermaids sing to them --" Come hither , broken - hearted ; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death ; here are wonders supernatural , without dying for them .
put up THY gravestone , too , within the churchyard , and come hither , till we marry thee !"
While yet a little distance from the forge , moody Ahab paused ; till at last , Perth , withdrawing his iron from the fire , began hammering it upon the anvil -- the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights , some of which flew close to Ahab .
" Because I am scorched all over , Captain Ahab ," answered Perth , resting for a moment on his hammer ; " I am past scorching ; not easily can ' st thou scorch a scar ."
But , away with child ' s play ; no more gaffs and pikes to - day .
This done , Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one , when Ahab stayed his hand , and said he would weld his own iron .
" Pray God , not that ; yet I fear something , Captain Ahab .
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale ?"
" For the white fiend !
Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb ?"
Pressing his foot upon it , till the rope hummed like a harp - string , then eagerly bending over it , and seeing no strandings , Ahab exclaimed , " Good !
and now for the seizings ."
But ere he entered his cabin , light , unnatural , half - bantering , yet most piteous sound was heard .
The Gilder .
Where lies the final harbor , whence we unmoor no more ?
Where is the foundling ' s father hidden ?
And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind , some few weeks after Ahab ' s harpoon had been welded .
It was a Nantucket ship , the Bachelor , which had just wedged in her last cask of oil , and bolted down her bursting hatches ; and now , in glad holiday apparel , was joyously , though somewhat vain - gloriously , sailing round among the widely - separated ships on the ground , previous to pointing her prow for home .
Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling - wood ; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil - butt , lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece .
In the forecastle , the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests , and filled them ; it was humorously added , that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler , and filled it ; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee - pot and filled it ; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them ; that indeed everything was filled with sperm , except the captain ' s pantaloons pockets , and those he reserved to thrust his hands into , in self - complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction .
Meanwhile , others of the ship ' s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try - works , from which the huge pots had been removed .
You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille , such wild cries they raised , as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea .
And Ahab , he too was standing on his quarter - deck , shaggy and black , with a stubborn gloom ; and as the two ships crossed each other ' s wakes -- one all jubilations for things passed , the other all forebodings as to things to come -- their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene .
cried the gay Bachelor ' s commander , lifting a glass and a bottle in the air .
" Thou art too damned jolly .
Come along , will ye ( merry ' s the play ); a full ship and homeward - bound ."
Forward there !
For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying -- the turning sunwards of the head , and so expiring -- that strange spectacle , beheld of such a placid evening , somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before .
" He turns and turns him to it ,-- how slowly , but how steadfastly , his homage - rendering and invoking brow , with his last dying motions .
In vain , oh whale , dost thou seek intercedings with yon all - quickening sun , that only calls forth life , but gives it not again .
Born of earth , yet suckled by the sea ; though hill and valley mothered me , ye billows are my foster - brothers !"
Have I not said , old man , that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine ?"
" And who are hearsed that die on the sea ?"
It was hard upon high noon ; and Ahab , seated in the bows of his high - hoisted boat , was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude .
That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean ' s immeasurable burning - glass .
So , swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship , and with his astrological - looking instrument placed to his eye , he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian .
Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed , the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship ' s deck , and with face thrown up like Ahab ' s , was eyeing the same sun with him ; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs , and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness .
" I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow , full of its tormented flaming life ; and I have seen it wane at last , down , down , to dumbest dust .
" Aye ," cried Stubb , " but sea - coal ashes -- mind ye that , Mr . Starbuck -- sea - coal , not your common charcoal .
Holding by a shroud , Starbuck was standing on the quarter - deck ; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft , to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there ; while Stubb and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats .
But all their pains seemed naught .
But as for me , all the start I have to meet it , is just across the deck here .
" Here !"
But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth , that its end may avoid all contact with the hull ; and as moreover , if kept constantly towing there , it would be liable to many mishaps , besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging , and more or less impeding the vessel ' s way in the water ; because of all this , the lower parts of a ship ' s lightning - rods are not always overboard ; but are generally made in long slender links , so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside , or thrown down into the sea , as occasion may require .
drop them over , fore and aft .
" What thinkest thou now , man ; I heard thy cry ; it was not the same in the song ."
But do they only have mercy on long faces ?-- have they no bowels for a laugh ?
Yes , our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles -- that ' s the good promise we saw ."
So ."
" Oh !
No fearless fool now fronts thee .
" I own thy speechless , placeless power ; said I not so ?
There burn the flames !
now I do glory in my genealogy .
what hast thou done with her ?
I know that of me , which thou knowest not of thyself , oh , thou omnipotent .
Oh , thou foundling fire , thou hermit immemorial , thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle , thy unparticipated grief .
I leap with thee ; I burn with thee ; would fain be welded with thee ; defyingly I worship thee !"
Overhearing Starbuck , the panic - stricken crew instantly ran to the braces -- though not a sail was left aloft .
And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats ; look ye here ; thus I blow out the last fear !"
And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame .
The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch .
Shall I strike it , sir ?"
" Strike nothing ; lash it .
If I had sky - sail poles , I ' d sway them up now ."
Send down my main - top - sail yard !
I would e ' en take it for sublime , did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady .
Midnight .-- The Forecastle Bulwarks .
No , Stubb ; you may pound that knot there as much as you please , but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying .
And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary ?
Here are hydrants , Flask .
" Yes , when a fellow ' s soaked through , it ' s hard to be sensible , that ' s a fact .
Never mind ; catch the turn there , and pass it .
These are your iron fists , hey ?
Thank ye .
Halloa !
" Um , um , um .
Stop that thunder !
We don ' t want thunder ; we want rum ; give us a glass of rum .
The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there , though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements .
Aye , aye ; and powder in the pan ;-- that ' s not good .
and in these same perilous seas , gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error - abounding log ?
and in this very Typhoon , did he not swear that he would have no lightning - rods ?
I can ' t withstand thee , then , old man .
What , then , remains ?
A touch , and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again .-- Oh Mary !
boy !-- But if I wake thee not to death , old man , who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck ' s body this day week may sink , with all the crew !
Shall I ?
thou mightest well be taken now for the sea - chariot of the sun .
But suddenly reined back by some counter thought , he hurried towards the helm , huskily demanding how the ship was heading .
It has happened before .
Meanwhile , whatever were his own secret thoughts , Starbuck said nothing , but quietly he issued all requisite orders ; while Stubb and Flask -- who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings -- likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced .
" Thou poor , proud heaven - gazer and sun ' s pilot !
Mr . Starbuck -- a lance without a pole ; a top - maul , and the smallest of the sail - maker ' s needles .
Besides , the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles , though clumsily practicable , was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors , without some shudderings and evil portents .
Then , with the maul , after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod , he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it , and less strongly hammered that , several times , the mate still holding the rod as before .
The sun is East , and that compass swears it !"
While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage , the log and line had but very seldom been in use .
Rains and spray had damped it ; sun and wind had warped it ; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly .
They went towards the extreme stern , on the ship ' s lee side , where the deck , with the oblique energy of the wind , was now almost dipping into the creamy , sidelong - rushing sea .
With these grey hairs of mine ' tis not worth while disputing , ' specially with a superior , who ' ll ne ' er confess ."
" What ' s that ?
" In the little rocky Isle of Man , sir ."
Up with the reel !
Up with it !
" There he goes now ; to him nothing ' s happened ; but to me , the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world .
Let ' s see now if ye haven ' t fished him up here , fisherman .
A hatchet !
Pip !
Here , boy ; Ahab ' s cabin shall be Pip ' s home henceforth , while Ahab lives .
Thou touchest my inmost centre , boy ; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart - strings .
Come , let ' s down ."
Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters , descrying no ships , and ere long , sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds , over waves monotonously mild ; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene .
In the sea , under certain circumstances , seals have more than once been mistaken for men .
They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before .
" A life - buoy of a coffin !"
" Rig it , carpenter ; do not look at me so -- the coffin , I mean .
moving his hand as with a hammer .
Make a life - buoy of the coffin , and no more .-- Mr .
I know an old woman of sixty - five who ran away with a bald - headed young tinker once .
Cruppered with a coffin !
But never mind .
We workers in woods make bridal - bedsteads and card - tables , as well as coffins and hearses .
Hem !
I ' ll have me -- let ' s see -- how many in the ship ' s company , all told ?
Let ' s to it ."
" Life - buoy , sir .
oh !
But art thou not also the undertaker ?"
Hast thou ever helped carry a bier , and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate , going in ?
Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself ?
Look at thy bosom !
I ' ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle , one of the Gallipagos , is cut by the Equator right in the middle .
Here we go again .
There ' s a sound !
A most malicious wag , that fellow .
how immaterial are all materials !
What things real are there , but imponderable thoughts ?
So far gone am I in the dark side of earth , that its other side , the theoretic bright one , seems but uncertain twilight to me .
I go below ; let me not see that thing here when I return again .
Next day , a large ship , the Rachel , was descried , bearing directly down upon the Pequod , all her spars thickly clustering with men .
A few keen pulls , and his boat - hook soon clinched the Pequod ' s main - chains , and he sprang to the deck .
The recall signals were placed in the rigging ; darkness came on ; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats -- ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction -- the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight , but , for the time , to increase her distance from it .
" Avast ," cried Ahab --" touch not a rope - yarn "; then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word --" Captain Gardiner , I will not do it .
Even now I lose time .
Mr . Starbuck , look at the binnacle watch , and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers : then brace forward again , and let the ship sail as before ."
The Cabin .
( AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK ; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW .)
" No , no , no !
" Oh !
But I will never desert ye , sir , as Stubb did him .
Listen , and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck , and still know that I am there .
True art thou , lad , as the circumference to its centre .
" Here he this instant stood ; I stand in his air ,-- but I ' m alone .
Pip !
What ?
Like machines , they dumbly moved about the deck , ever conscious that the old man ' s despot eye was on them .
Such an added , gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now ; such ceaseless shudderings shook him ; that the men looked dubious at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being ' s body .
For not by night , even , had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber , or go below .
Nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck , unless Ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits ,-- the main - mast and the mizen ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin - scuttle ,-- his living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat , they could never tell unerringly whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether he was still intently scanning them ; no matter , though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the unheeded night - damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone - carved coat and hat .
But if these suspicions were really his , he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them , however his actions might seem to hint them .
And thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles ,-- ahead , astern , this side , and that ,-- within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height .
Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then spiralized downwards , and went eddying again round his head .
But already the sable wing was before the old man ' s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize .
" Brace forward !
Up helm !"
cried Ahab like lightning to his men .
yonder !
But though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the sex , as it were , that distinguished them .
Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us !
But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha , laughing - eyed elves , heedlessly gambol around their old sire ; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt - out crater of his brain .
" Sir ."
Why this strife of the chase ?
God !-- crack my heart !-- stave my brain !-- mockery !
bitter , biting mockery of grey hairs , have I lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus intolerably old ?
Close !
No , no ; stay on board , on board !-- lower not when I do ; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick .
No , no !
" They have , they have .
we head for Nantucket !
Come , my Captain , study out the course , and let us away !
By heaven , man , we are turned round and round in this world , like yonder windlass , and Fate is the handspike .
that smiling sky , and this unsounded sea !
Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail .
CHAPTER 133
He declared that a whale must be near .
Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck , Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle , so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands .
alow and aloft , and on both sides !"
All sail being set , he now cast loose the life - line , reserved for swaying him to the main royal - mast head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main - top - sail and top - gallant - sail , he raised a gull - like cry in the air .
" And did none of ye see it before ?"
cried Ahab , hailing the perched men all around him .
There she blows !-- there she blows !-- there she blows !
There again !-- there again !"
" Be dumb , man !
Hard down the helm !-- brace up !
The breeze now freshened ; the sea began to swell .
In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse .
With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the tiger - yellow crew were tumbling over each other ' s heads to gain the uttermost stern .
* This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale .
But soon resuming his horizontal attitude , Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault .
Far inland , nameless wails came from him , as desolate sounds from out ravines .
And so , such hearts , though summary in each one suffering ; still , if the gods decree it , in their life - time aggregate a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous intensities ; for even in their pointless centres , those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls .
there !
going to leeward still ; what a leaping spout !-- Hands off from me !
" Aye , sir ," said Starbuck drawing near , "' tis a solemn sight ; an omen , and an ill one ."
Cold , cold -- I shiver !-- How now ?
Stubb , send a fresh hand to the fore - mast head , and see it manned till morning ."
The Chase -- Second Day .
cried Stubb , " but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one ' s legs and tingles at the heart .
" Aye , aye !"
The wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race .
" Sway me up , men ; ye have been deceived ; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way , and then disappears ."
down all of ye , but one man at the fore .
As with Fedallah the day before , so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat ' s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day ' s mishap .
" Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir ."
By heaven it cannot be !-- missing ?-- quick !
But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found .
steady , steady for your life !
But in this matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand -- a lipless , unfeatured blank .
that thou obeyest mine .-- Stand round me , men .
So with Moby Dick -- two days he ' s floated -- tomorrow will be the third .
" And as mechanical ," muttered Ahab .
When dusk descended , the whale was still in sight to leeward .
The Chase .-- Third Day .
What a lovely day again !
were it a new - made world , and made for a summer - house to the angels , and this morning the first of its throwing open to them , a fairer day could not dawn upon that world .
to think ' s audacity .
And yet , I ' ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm -- frozen calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents turned to ice , and shiver it .
Were I the wind , I ' d blow no more on such a wicked , miserable world .
I ' d crawl somewhere to a cave , and slink there .
And yet , ' tis a noble and heroic thing , the wind !
And yet , I say again , and swear it now , that there ' s something all glorious and gracious in the wind .
And by the eternal Poles !
" Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw ," murmured Starbuck to himself , as he coiled the new - hauled main - brace upon the rail .
" Stand by to sway me up !"
A whole hour now passed ; gold - beaten out to ages .
The same !-- the same !-- the same to Noah as to me .
They must lead somewhere -- to something else than common land , more palmy than the palms .
Aye , minus a leg , that ' s all .
What ' s that he said ?
In due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his shallop ' s stern , Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent , he waved to the mate ,-- who held one of the tackle - ropes on deck -- and bade him pause .
" Truth , sir : saddest truth ."
Their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; Starbuck ' s tears the glue .
" Lower away !"
Mary , girl !
See ye my boy ' s hand on the hill ?-- Crazed ;-- aloft there !-- keep thy keenest eye upon the boats :-- mark well the whale !-- Ho !
again !-- drive off that hawk !
he soars away with it !-- Where ' s the old man now ?
to their uttermost heads drive them in !
those boats are useless now ; repair them if ye can in time , and return to me ; if not , Ahab is enough to die -- Down , men !
the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in , that thing I harpoon .
Ye are not other men , but my arms and my legs ; and so obey me .-- Where ' s the whale ?
It is thou , thou , that madly seekest him !"
And at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel , so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck ' s face as he leaned over the rail , he hailed him to turn the vessel about , and follow him , not too swiftly , at a judicious interval .
And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the main - mast - head , he shouted to Tashtego , who had just gained that perch , to descend again for another flag , and a hammer and nails , and so nail it to the mast .
As it was , three of the oarsmen -- who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart , and were therefore unprepared for its effects -- these were flung out ; but so fell , that , in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again , and rising to its level on a combing wave , hurled themselves bodily inboard again ; the third man helplessly dropping astern , but still afloat and swimming .
oars !
I see : the ship !
the ship !
He turns to meet us !
My God , stand by me now !"
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !
For me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let Stubb die in his drawers !
Like dislodged trucks , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull - like necks .
" The ship !
Ho , ho !
THUS , I give up the spear !"
Great God , where is the ship ?"
But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible , together with long streaming yards of the flag , which calmly undulated , with ironical coincidings , over the destroying billows they almost touched ;-- at that instant , a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air , in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar .
Round and round , then , and ever contracting towards the button - like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another Ixion I did revolve .
Book I
Him the Almighty Power Hurled headlong flaming from th ' ethereal sky , With hideous ruin and combustion , down To bottomless perdition , there to dwell In adamantine chains and penal fire , Who durst defy th ' Omnipotent to arms .
At once , as far as Angels ken , he views The dismal situation waste and wild .
To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee , and deify his power Who , from the terror of this arm , so late Doubted his empire -- that were low indeed ; That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall ; since , by fate , the strength of Gods , And this empyreal sybstance , cannot fail ; Since , through experience of this great event , In arms not worse , in foresight much advanced , We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal war , Irreconcilable to our grand Foe , Who now triumphs , and in th ' excess of joy Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven ."
Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool His mighty stature ; on each hand the flames Driven backward slope their pointing spires , and , rolled In billows , leave i ' th ' midst a horrid vale .
" Is this the region , this the soil , the clime ," Said then the lost Archangel , " this the seat That we must change for Heaven ?-- this mournful gloom For that celestial light ?
They heard , and were abashed , and up they sprung Upon the wing , as when men wont to watch On duty , sleeping found by whom they dread , Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake .
Him the Ammonite Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain , In Argob and in Basan , to the stream Of utmost Arnon .
Next Chemos , th ' obscene dread of Moab ' s sons , From Aroar to Nebo and the wild Of southmost Abarim ; in Hesebon And Horonaim , Seon ' s real , beyond The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines , And Eleale to th ' Asphaltic Pool : Peor his other name , when he enticed Israel in Sittim , on their march from Nile , To do him wanton rites , which cost them woe .
To him no temple stood Or altar smoked ; yet who more oft than he In temples and at altars , when the priest Turns atheist , as did Eli ' s sons , who filled With lust and violence the house of God ?
In courts and palaces he also reigns , And in luxurious cities , where the noise Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers , And injury and outrage ; and , when night Darkens the streets , then wander forth the sons Of Belial , flown with insolence and wine .
He , above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent , Stood like a tower .
O Powers Matchless , but with th ' Almighth !-- and that strife Was not inglorious , though th ' event was dire , As this place testifies , and this dire change , Hateful to utter .
By him first Men also , and by his suggestion taught , Ransacked the centre , and with impious hands Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth For treasures better hid .
Let none admire That riches grow in Hell ; that soil may best Deserve the precious bane .
His hand was known In Heaven by many a towered structure high , Where sceptred Angels held their residence , And sat as Princes , whom the supreme King Exalted to such power , and gave to rule , Each in his Hierarchy , the Orders bright .
Their summons called From every band and squared regiment By place or choice the worthiest : they anon With hundreds and with thousands trooping came Attended .
But far within , And in their own dimensions like themselves , The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat , A thousand demi - gods on golden seats , Frequent and full .
Where there is , then , no good For which to strive , no strife can grow up there From faction : for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence ; none whose portion is so small Of present pain that with ambitious mind Will covet more !
Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The vassals of his anger , when the scourge Inexorably , and the torturing hour , Calls us to penance ?
On th ' other side up rose Belial , in act more graceful and humane .
Yet he pleased the ear , And with persuasive accent thus began :-- " I should be much for open war , O Peers , As not behind in hate , if what was urged Main reason to persuade immediate war Did not dissuade me most , and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success ; When he who most excels in fact of arms , In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful , grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution , as the scope Of all his aim , after some dire revenge .
First , what revenge ?
What when we fled amain , pursued and struck With Heaven ' s afflicting thunder , and besought The Deep to shelter us ?
Better these than worse , By my advice ; since fate inevitable Subdues us , and omnipotent decree , The Victor ' s will .
This is now Our doom ; which if we can sustain and bear , Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit His anger , and perhaps , thus far removed , Not mind us not offending , satisfied With what is punished ; whence these raging fires Will slacken , if his breath stir not their flames .
Mustering their rage , and Heaven resembles Hell !
This desert soil Wants not her hidden lustre , gems and gold ; Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise Magnificence ; and what can Heaven show more ?
or these titles now Must we renounce , and , changing style , be called Princes of Hell ?
while we dream , And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed This place our dungeon , not our safe retreat Beyond his potent arm , to live exempt From Heaven ' s high jurisdiction , in new league Banded against his throne , but to remain In strictest bondage , though thus far removed , Under th ' inevitable curb , reserved His captive multitude .
whom shall we find Sufficient ?
who shall tempt with wandering feet The dark , unbottomed , infinite Abyss , And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way , or spread his airy flight , Upborne with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt , ere he arrive The happy Isle ?
Nor failed they to express how much they praised That for the general safety he despised His own : for neither do the Spirits damned Lose all their virtue ; lest bad men should boast Their specious deeds on earth , which glory excites , Or close ambition varnished o ' er with zeal .
Others , with vast Typhoean rage , more fell , Rend up both rocks and hills , and ride the air In whirlwind ; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar :-- As when Alcides , from Oechalia crowned With conquest , felt th ' envenomed robe , and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines , And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th ' Euboic sea .
Of good and evil much they argued then , Of happiness and final misery , Passion and apathy , and glory and shame : Vain wisdom all , and false philosophy !-- Yet , with a pleasing sorcery , could charm Pain for a while or anguish , and excite Fallacious hope , or arm th ' obdured breast With stubborn patience as with triple steel .
Beyond this flood a frozen continent Lies dark and wild , beat with perpetual storms Of whirlwind and dire hail , which on firm land Thaws not , but gathers heap , and ruin seems Of ancient pile ; all else deep snow and ice , A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old , Where armies whole have sunk : the parching air Burns frore , and cold performs th ' effect of fire .
Retire ; or taste thy folly , and learn by proof , Hell - born , not to contend with Spirits of Heaven ."
She spake , and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore : then these to her Satan returned :-- " So strange thy outcry , and thy words so strange Thou interposest , that my sudden hand , Prevented , spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends , till first I know of thee What thing thou art , thus double - formed , and why , In this infernal vale first met , thou call ' st Me father , and that phantasm call ' st my son .
T ' whom thus the Portress of Hell - gate replied :-- " Hast thou forgot me , then ; and do I seem Now in thine eye so foul ?-- once deemed so fair In Heaven , when at th ' assembly , and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combined In bold conspiracy against Heaven ' s King , All on a sudden miserable pain Surprised thee , dim thine eyes and dizzy swum In darkness , while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth , till on the left side opening wide , Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright , Then shining heavenly fair , a goddess armed , Out of thy head I sprung .
Amazement seized All th ' host of Heaven ; back they recoiled afraid At first , and called me Sin , and for a sign Portentous held me ; but , familiar grown , I pleased , and with attractive graces won The most averse -- thee chiefly , who , full oft Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing , Becam ' st enamoured ; and such joy thou took ' st With me in secret that my womb conceived A growing burden .
Thou art my father , thou my author , thou My being gav ' st me ; whom should I obey But thee ?
She opened ; but to shut Excelled her power : the gates wide open stood , That with extended wings a bannered host , Under spread ensigns marching , mibht pass through With horse and chariots ranked in loose array ; So wide they stood , and like a furnace - mouth Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame .
Thither he plies Undaunted , to meet there whatever Power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside , of whom to ask Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies Bordering on light ; when straight behold the throne Of Chaos , and his dark pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep !
But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears , and from the walls of Heaven Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn .
before the sun , Before the Heavens thou wert , and at the voice Of God , as with a mantle , didst invest *** The rising world of waters dark and deep , Won from the void and formless infinite .
they therefore , as to right belong $ ' d , So were created , nor can justly accuse Their Maker , or their making , or their fate , As if predestination over - rul ' d Their will dispos ' d by absolute decree Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed Their own revolt , not I ; if I foreknew , Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault , Which had no less proved certain unforeknown .
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be question ' d and blasphem ' d without defence .
And I will place within them as a guide , My umpire Conscience ; whom if they will hear , Light after light , well us ' d , they shall attain , And to the end , persisting , safe arrive .
This my long sufferance , and my day of grace , They who neglect and scorn , shall never taste ; But hard be harden ' d , blind be blinded more , That they may stumble on , and deeper fall ; And none but such from mercy I exclude .
But yet all is not done ; Man disobeying , Disloyal , breaks his fealty , and sins Against the high supremacy of Heaven , Affecting God - head , and , so losing all , To expiate his treason hath nought left , But to destruction sacred and devote , He , with his whole posterity , must die , Die he or justice must ; unless for him Some other able , and as willing , pay The rigid satisfaction , death for death .
As in him perish all men , so in thee , As from a second root , shall be restored As many as are restored , without thee none .
Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by , For regal scepter then no more shall need , God shall be all in all .
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending , bands Of guardians bright , when he from Esau fled To Padan - Aram , in the field of Luz Dreaming by night under the open sky And waking cried , This is the gate of Heaven .
As when a scout , Through dark ?
; nd desart ways with ? oeril gone All ? might ,?
I saw when at his word the formless mass , This world ' s material mould , came to a heap : Confusion heard his voice , and wild uproar Stood ruled , stood vast infinitude confined ; Till at his second bidding Darkness fled , Light shone , and order from disorder sprung : Swift to their several quarters hasted then The cumbrous elements , earth , flood , air , fire ; And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven Flew upward , spirited with various forms , That rolled orbicular , and turned to stars Numberless , as thou seest , and how they move ; Each had his place appointed , each his course ; The rest in circuit walls this universe .
Thus said , he turned ; and Satan , bowing low , As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven , Where honour due and reverence none neglects , Took leave , and toward the coast of earth beneath , Down from the ecliptick , sped with hoped success , Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel ; Nor staid , till on Niphates ' top he lights .
O , for that warning voice , which he , who saw The Apocalypse , heard cry in Heaven aloud , Then when the Dragon , put to second rout , Came furious down to be revenged on men , Woe to the inhabitants on earth !
Be then his love accursed , since love or hate , To me alike , it deals eternal woe .
But say I could repent , and could obtain , By act of grace , my former state ; how soon Would highth recall high thoughts , how soon unsay What feigned submission swore ?
For heavenly minds from such distempers foul Are ever clear .
Whereof he soon aware , Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm , Artificer of fraud ; and was the first That practised falsehood under saintly show , Deep malice to conceal , couched with revenge : Yet not enough had practised to deceive Uriel once warned ; whose eye pursued him down The way he went , and on the Assyrian mount Saw him disfigured , more than could befall Spirit of happy sort ; his gestures fierce He marked and mad demeanour , then alone , As he supposed , all unobserved , unseen .
As when to them who fail Beyond the Cape of Hope , and now are past Mozambick , off at sea north - east winds blow Sabean odours from the spicy shore Of Araby the blest ; with such delay Well pleased they slack their course , and many a league Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles : So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend , Who came their bane ; though with them better pleased Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume That drove him , though enamoured , from the spouse Of Tobit ' s son , and with a vengeance sent From Media post to Egypt , there fast bound .
Not that fair field Of Enna , where Proserpine gathering flowers , Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis Was gathered , which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world ; nor that sweet grove Of Daphne by Orontes , and the inspired Castalian spring , might with this Paradise Of Eden strive ; nor that Nyseian isle Girt with the river Triton , where old Cham , Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove , Hid Amalthea , and her florid son Young Bacchus , from his stepdame Rhea ' s eye ; Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard , Mount Amara , though this by some supposed True Paradise under the Ethiop line By Nilus ' head , enclosed with shining rock , A whole day ' s journey high , but wide remote From this Assyrian garden , where the Fiend Saw , undelighted , all delight , all kind Of living creatures , new to sight , and strange Two of far nobler shape , erect and tall , Godlike erect , with native honour clad In naked majesty seemed lords of all : And worthy seemed ; for in their looks divine The image of their glorious Maker shone , Truth , wisdom , sanctitude severe and pure , ( Severe , but in true filial freedom placed ,) Whence true authority in men ; though both Not equal , as their sex not equal seemed ; For contemplation he and valour formed ; For softness she and sweet attractive grace ; He for God only , she for God in him : His fair large front and eye sublime declared Absolute rule ; and hyacinthine locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustering , but not beneath his shoulders broad : She , as a veil , down to the slender waist Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dishevelled , but in wanton ringlets waved As the vine curls her tendrils , which implied Subjection , but required with gentle sway , And by her yielded , by him best received , Yielded with coy submission , modest pride , And sweet , reluctant , amorous delay .
So passed they naked on , nor shunned the sight Of God or Angel ; for they thought no ill : So hand in hand they passed , the loveliest pair , That ever since in love ' s embraces met ; Adam the goodliest man of men since born His sons , the fairest of her daughters Eve .
About them frisking played All beasts of the earth , since wild , and of all chase In wood or wilderness , forest or den ; Sporting the lion ramped , and in his paw Dandled the kid ; bears , tigers , ounces , pards , Gambolled before them ; the unwieldy elephant , To make them mirth , used all his might , and wreathed His ? kithetmroboscis ; close the serpent sly , Insinuating , wove with Gordian twine His braided train , and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded ; others on the grass Couched , and now filled with pasture gazing sat , Or bedward ruminating ; for the sun , Declined , was hasting now with prone career To the ocean isles , and in the ascending scale Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose : When Satan still in gaze , as first he stood , Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad .
Into our room of bliss thus high advanced Creatures of other mould , earth - born perhaps , Not Spirits , yet to heavenly Spirits bright Little inferiour ; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder , and could love , so lively shines In them divine resemblance , and such grace The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured .
what thou hast said is just and right .
For we to him indeed all praises owe , And daily thanks ; I chiefly , who enjoy So far the happier lot , enjoying thee Pre - eminent by so much odds , while thou Like consort to thyself canst no where find .
Can it be sin to know ?
Is that their happy state , The proof of their obedience and their faith ?
hence I will excite their minds With more desire to know , and to reject Envious commands , invented with design To keep them low , whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods : aspiring to be such , They taste and die : What likelier can ensue But first with narrow search I must walk round This garden , and no corner leave unspied ; A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side , Or in thick shade retired , from him to draw What further would be learned .
Uriel , no wonder if thy perfect sight , Amid the sun ' s bright circle where thou sitst , See far and wide : In at this gate none pass The vigilance here placed , but such as come Well known from Heaven ; and since meridian hour No creature thence : If Spirit of other sort , So minded , have o ' er - leaped these earthly bounds On purpose , hard thou knowest it to exclude Spiritual substance with corporeal bar .
But if within the circuit of these walks , In whatsoever shape he lurk , of whom Thou tellest , by morrow dawning I shall know .
To - morrow , ere fresh morning streak the east With first approach of light , we must be risen , And at our pleasant labour , to reform Yon flowery arbours , yonder alleys green , Our walk at noon , with branches overgrown , That mock our scant manuring , and require More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth : Those blossoms also , and those dropping gums , That lie bestrown , unsightly and unsmooth , Ask riddance , if we mean to tread with ease ; Mean while , as Nature wills , night bids us rest .
Sweet is the breath of Morn , her rising sweet , With charm of earliest birds : pleasant the sun , When first on this delightful land he spreads His orient beams , on herb , tree , fruit , and flower , Glistering with dew ; fragrant the fertile earth After soft showers ; and sweet the coming on Of grateful Evening mild ; then silent Night , With this her solemn bird , and this fair moon , And these the gems of Heaven , her starry train : But neither breath of Morn , when she ascends With charm of earliest birds ; nor rising sun On this delightful land ; nor herb , fruit , flower , Glistering with dew ; nor fragrance after showers ; Nor grateful Evening mild ; nor silent Night , With this her solemn bird , nor walk by moon , Or glittering star - light , without thee is sweet .
But wherefore all night long shine these ?
Daughter of God and Man , accomplished Eve , These have their course to finish round the earth , By morrow evening , and from land to land In order , though to nations yet unborn , Ministring light prepared , they set and rise ; Lest total Darkness should by night regain Her old possession , and extinguish life In Nature and all things ; which these soft fires Not only enlighten , but with kindly heat Of various influence foment and warm , Temper or nourish , or in part shed down Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow On earth , made hereby apter to receive Perfection from the sun ' s more potent ray .
too like In sad event , when to the unwiser son Of Japhet brought by Hermes , she ensnared Mankind with her fair looks , to be avenged On him who had stole Jove ' s authentick fire .
But thou hast promised from us two a race To fill the earth , who shall with us extol Thy goodness infinite , both when we wake , And when we seek , as now , thy gift of sleep .
By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men Among the bestial herds to range ; by thee Founded in reason , loyal , just , and pure , Relations dear , and all the charities Of father , son , and brother , first were known .
This evening from the sun ' s decline arrived , Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen Hitherward bent ( who could have thought ?)
I hear the tread of nimble feet Hasting this way , and now by glimpse discern Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade ; And with them comes a third of regal port , But faded splendour wan ; who by his gait And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell , Not likely to part hence without contest ; Stand firm , for in his look defiance lours .
Who would not , finding way , break loose from Hell , Though thither doomed !
But wherefore thou alone ?
To which the Fiend thus answered , frowning stern .
To say and straight unsay , pretending first Wise to fly pain , professing next the spy , Argues no leader but a liear traced , Satan , and couldst thou faithful add ?
to thy rebellious crew ?
Army of Fiends , fit body to fit head .
So threatened he ; but Satan to no threats Gave heed , but waxing more in rage replied .
On the other side , Satan , alarmed , Collecting all his might , dilated stood , Like Teneriff or Atlas , unremoved : His stature reached the sky , and on his crest Sat Horrour plumed ; nor wanted in his grasp What seemed both spear and shield : Now dreadful deeds Might have ensued , nor only Paradise In this commotion , but the starry cope Of Heaven perhaps , or all the elements At least had gone to wrack , disturbed and torn With violence of this conflict , had not soon The Eternal , to prevent such horrid fray , Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales , yet seen Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign , Wherein all things created first he weighed , The pendulous round earth with balanced air In counterpoise , now ponders all events , Battles and realms : In these he put two weights , The sequel each of parting and of fight : The latter quick up flew , and kicked the beam , Which Gabriel spying , thus bespake the Fiend .
since thine no more Than Heaven permits , nor mine , though doubled now To trample thee as mire : For proof look up , And read thy lot in yon celestial sign ; Where thou art weighed , and shown how light , how weak , If thou resist .
Book V
I rose as at thy call , but found thee not ; To find thee I directed then my walk ; And on , methought , alone I passed through ways That brought me on a sudden to the tree Of interdicted knowledge : fair it seemed , Much fairer to my fancy than by day : And , as I wondering looked , beside it stood One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven By us oft seen ; his dewy locks distilled Ambrosia ; on that tree he also gazed ; And ' O fair plant ,' said he , ' with fruit surcharged , ' Deigns none to ease thy load , and taste thy sweet , ' Nor God , nor Man ?
Moon , that now meetest the orient sun , now flyest , With the fixed Stars , fixed in their orb that flies ; And ye five other wandering Fires , that move In mystick dance not without song , resound His praise , who out of darkness called up light .
His praise , ye Winds , that from four quarters blow , Breathe soft or loud ; and , wave your tops , ye Pines , With every plant , in sign of worship wave .
So spake the Eternal Father , and fulfilled All justice : Nor delayed the winged Saint After his charge received ; but from among Thousand celestial Ardours , where he stood Veiled with his gorgeous wings , up springing light , Flew through the midst of Heaven ; the angelick quires , On each hand parting , to his speed gave way Through all the empyreal road ; till , at the gate Of Heaven arrived , the gate self - opened wide On golden hinges turning , as by work Divine the sovran Architect had framed .
Down thither prone in flight He speeds , and through the vast ethereal sky Sails between worlds and worlds , with steady wing Now on the polar winds , then with quick fan Winnows the buxom air ; till , within soar Of towering eagles , to all the fowls he seems A phoenix , gazed by all as that sole bird , When , to enshrine his reliques in the Sun ' s Bright temple , to Egyptian Thebes he flies .
small store will serve , where store , All seasons , ripe for use hangs on the stalk ; Save what by frugal storing firmness gains To nourish , and superfluous moist consumes : But I will haste , and from each bough and brake , Each plant and juciest gourd , will pluck such choice To entertain our Angel - guest , as he Beholding shall confess , that here on Earth God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven .
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild .
A while discourse they hold ; No fear lest dinner cool ; when thus began Our author .
Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed , Not burdened nature , sudden mind arose In Adam , not to let the occasion pass Given him by this great conference to know Of things above his world , and of their being Who dwell in Heaven , whose excellence he saw Transcend his own so far ; whose radiant forms , Divine effulgence , whose high power , so far Exceeded human ; and his wary speech Thus to the empyreal minister he framed .
To whom the Angel .
yet for thy good This is dispensed ; and what surmounts the reach Of human sense , I shall delineate so , By likening spiritual to corporal forms , As may express them best ; though what if Earth Be but a shadow of Heaven , and things therein Each to other like , more than on earth is thought ?
That day , as other solemn days , they spent In song and dance about the sacred hill ; Mystical dance , which yonder starry sphere Of planets , and of fixed , in all her wheels Resembles nearest , mazes intricate , Eccentrick , intervolved , yet regular Then most , when most irregular they seem ; And in their motions harmony divine So smooths her charming tones , that God ' s own ear Listens delighted .
On flowers reposed , and with fresh flowerets crowned , They eat , they drink , and in communion sweet Quaff immortality and joy , secure Of surfeit , where full measure only bounds Excess , before the all - bounteous King , who showered With copious hand , rejoicing in their joy .
and rememberest what decree Of yesterday , so late hath passed the lips Of Heaven ' s Almighty .
New laws thou seest imposed ; New laws from him who reigns , new minds may raise In us who serve , new counsels to debate What doubtful may ensue : More in this place To utter is not safe .
Regions they passed , the mighty regencies Of Seraphim , and Potentates , and Thrones , In their triple degrees ; regions to which All thy dominion , Adam , is no more Than what this garden is to all the earth , And all the sea , from one entire globose Stretched into longitude ; which having passed , At length into the limits of the north They came ; and Satan to his royal seat High on a hill , far blazing , as a mount Raised on a mount , with pyramids and towers From diamond quarries hewn , and rocks of gold ; The palace of great Lucifer , ( so call That structure in the dialect of men Interpreted ,) which not long after , he Affecting all equality with God , In imitation of that mount whereon Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven , The Mountain of the Congregation called ; For thither he assembled all his train , Pretending so commanded to consult About the great reception of their King , Thither to come , and with calumnious art Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears .
much less for this to be our Lord , And look for adoration , to the abuse Of those imperial titles , which assert Our being ordained to govern , not to serve .
Shalt thou give law to God ?
Cease then this impious rage , And tempt not these ; but hasten to appease The incensed Father , and the incensed Son , While pardon may be found in time besought .
Our puissance is our own ; our own right hand Shall teach us highest deeds , by proof to try Who is our equal : Then thou shalt behold Whether by supplication we intend Address , and to begirt the almighty throne Beseeching or besieging .
So spake the Seraph Abdiel , faithful found Among the faithless , faithful only he ; Among innumerable false , unmoved , Unshaken , unseduced , unterrified , His loyalty he kept , his love , his zeal ; Nor number , nor example , with him wrought To swerve from truth , or change his constant mind , Though single .
On they move Indissolubly firm ; nor obvious hill , Nor straitening vale , nor wood , nor stream , divides Their perfect ranks ; for high above the ground Their march was , and the passive air upbore Their nimble tread ; as when the total kind Of birds , in orderly array on wing , Came summoned over Eden to receive Their names of thee ; so over many a tract Of Heaven they marched , and many a province wide , Tenfold the length of this terrene : At last , Far in the horizon to the north appeared From skirt to skirt a fiery region , stretched In battailous aspect , and nearer view Bristled with upright beams innumerable Of rigid spears , and helmets thronged , and shields Various , with boastful argument portrayed , The banded Powers of Satan hasting on With furious expedition ; for they weened That self - same day , by fight or by surprise , To win the mount of God , and on his throne To set the Envier of his state , the proud Aspirer ; but their thoughts proved fond and vain In the mid way : Though strange to us it seemed At first , that Angel should with Angel war , And in fierce hosting meet , who wont to meet So oft in festivals of joy and love Unanimous , as sons of one great Sire , Hymning the Eternal Father : But the shout Of battle now began , and rushing sound Of onset ended soon each milder thought .
that such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain , where faith and realty Remain not : Wherefore should not strength and might There fail where virtue fails , or weakest prove Where boldest , though to fight unconquerable ?
So pondering , and from his armed peers Forth stepping opposite , half - way he met His daring foe , at this prevention more Incensed , and thus securely him defied .
Author of evil , unknown till thy revolt , Unnamed in Heaven , now plenteous as thou seest These acts of hateful strife , hateful to all , Though heaviest by just measure on thyself , And thy adherents : How hast thou disturbed Heaven ' s blessed peace , and into nature brought Misery , uncreated till the crime Of thy rebellion !
how hast thou instilled Thy malice into thousands , once upright And faithful , now proved false !
err not , that so shall end The strife which thou callest evil , but we style The strife of glory ; which we mean to win , Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell Thou fablest ; here however to dwell free , If not to reign : Mean while thy utmost force , And join him named Almighty to thy aid , I fly not , but have sought thee far and nigh .
I might relate of thousands , and their names Eternize here on earth ; but those elect Angels , contented with their fame in Heaven , Seek not the praise of men : The other sort , In might though wonderous and in acts of war , Nor of renown less eager , yet by doom Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory , Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell .
but what we more affect , Honour , dominion , glory , and renown ; Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight , ( And if one day , why not eternal days ?)
Deliverer from new Lords , leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods ; yet hard For Gods , and too unequal work we find , Against unequal arms to fight in pain , Against unpained , impassive ; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue ; for what avails Valour or strength , though matchless , quelled with pain Which all subdues , and makes remiss the hands Of mightiest ?
Sense of pleasure we may well Spare out of life perhaps , and not repine , But live content , which is the calmest life : But pain is perfect misery , the worst Of evils , and , excessive , overturns All patience .
At interview both stood A while ; but suddenly at head appeared Satan , and thus was heard commanding loud .
Heaven , witness thou anon !
O Friends !
why come not on these victors proud Ere while they fierce were coming ; and when we , To entertain them fair with open front And breast , ( what could we more ?)
war seemed a civil game To this uproar ; horrid confusion heaped Upon confusion rose : And now all Heaven Had gone to wrack , with ruin overspread ; Had not the Almighty Father , where he sits Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure , Consulting on the sum of things , foreseen This tumult , and permitted all , advised : That his great purpose he might so fulfil , To honour his anointed Son avenged Upon his enemies , and to declare All power on him transferred : Whence to his Son , The Assessour of his throne , he thus began .
Effulgence of my glory , Son beloved , Son , in whose face invisible is beheld Visibly , what by Deity I am ; And in whose hand what by decree I do , Second Omnipotence !
Into thee such virtue and grace Immense I have transfused , that all may know In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare ; And , this perverse commotion governed thus , To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things ; to be Heir , and to be King By sacred unction , thy deserved right .
Go then , Thou Mightiest , in thy Father ' s might ; Ascend my chariot , guide the rapid wheels That shake Heaven ' s basis , bring forth all my war , My bow and thunder , my almighty arms Gird on , and sword upon thy puissant thigh ; Pursue these sons of darkness , drive them out From all Heaven ' s bounds into the utter deep : There let them learn , as likes them , to despise God , and Messiah his anointed King .
O Father , O Supreme of heavenly Thrones , First , Highest , Holiest , Best ; thou always seek ' st To glorify thy Son , I always thee , As is most just : This I my glory account , My exaltation , and my whole delight , That thou , in me well pleased , declarest thy will Fulfilled , which to fulfil is all my bliss .
Scepter and power , thy giving , I assume , And gladlier shall resign , when in the end Thou shalt be all in all , and I in thee For ever ; and in me all whom thou lovest : But whom thou hatest , I hate , and can put on Thy terrours , as I put thy mildness on , Image of thee in all things ; and shall soon , Armed with thy might , rid Heaven of these rebelled ; To their prepared ill mansion driven down , To chains of darkness , and the undying worm ; That from thy just obedience could revolt , Whom to obey is happiness entire .
Mean while inhabit lax , ye Powers of Heaven ; And thou my Word , begotten Son , by thee This I perform ; speak thou , and be it done !
Again , God said , Let there be firmament Amid the waters , and let it divide The waters from the waters ; and God made The firmament , expanse of liquid , pure , Transparent , elemental air , diffused In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great round ; partition firm and sure , The waters underneath from those above Dividing : for as earth , so he the world Built on circumfluous waters calm , in wide Crystalline ocean , and the loud misrule Of Chaos far removed ; lest fierce extremes Contiguous might distemper the whole frame : And Heaven he named the Firmament : So even And morning chorus sung the second day .
The Earth was formed , but in the womb as yet Of waters , embryon immature involved , Appeared not : over all the face of Earth Main ocean flowed , not idle ; but , with warm Prolifick humour softening all her globe , Fermented the great mother to conceive , Satiate with genial moisture ; when God said , Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven Into one place , and let dry land appear .
Here finished he , and all that he had made Viewed , and behold all was entirely good ; So even and morn accomplished the sixth day : Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting , though unwearied , up returned , Up to the Heaven of Heavens , his high abode ; Thence to behold this new created world , The addition of his empire , how it showed In prospect from his throne , how good , how fair , Answering his great idea .
infinite Thy power !
what thought can measure thee , or tongue Relate thee !
When I behold this goodly frame , this world , Of Heaven and Earth consisting ; and compute Their magnitudes ; this Earth , a spot , a grain , An atom , with the firmament compared And all her numbered stars , that seem to roll Spaces incomprehensible , ( for such Their distance argues , and their swift return Diurnal ,) merely to officiate light Round this opacous Earth , this punctual spot , One day and night ; in all her vast survey Useless besides ; reasoning I oft admire , How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions , with superfluous hand So many nobler bodies to create , Greater so manifold , to this one use , For aught appears , and on their orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated ; while the sedentary Earth , That better might with far less compass move , Served by more noble than herself , attains Her end without least motion , and receives , As tribute , such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed , her warmth and light ; Speed , to describe whose swiftness number fails .
God , to remove his ways from human sense , Placed Heaven from Earth so far , that earthly sight , If it presume , might err in things too high , And no advantage gain .
But whether thus these things , or whether not ; But whether the sun , predominant in Heaven , Rise on the earth ; or earth rise on the sun ; He from the east his flaming road begin ; Or she from west her silent course advance , With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft axle , while she paces even , And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along ; Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid ; Leave them to God above ; him serve , and fear !
And , freed from intricacies , taught to live The easiest way ; nor with perplexing thoughts To interrupt the sweet of life , from which God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares , And not molest us ; unless we ourselves Seek them with wandering thoughts , and notions vain .
I named them , as they passed , and understood Their nature , with such knowledge God endued My sudden apprehension : But in these I found not what methought I wanted still ; And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed .
Knowest thou not Their language and their ways ?
They also know , And reason not contemptibly : With these Find pastime , and bear rule ; thy realm is large .
Let not my words offend thee , Heavenly Power ; My Maker , be propitious while I speak .
Which must be mutual , in proportion due Given and received ; but , in disparity The one intense , the other still remiss , Cannot well suit with either , but soon prove Tedious alike : Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek , fit to participate All rational delight : wherein the brute Cannot be human consort : They rejoice Each with their kind , lion with lioness ; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined : Much less can bird with beast , or fish with fowl So well converse , nor with the ox the ape ; Worse then can man with beast , and least of all .
Whereto the Almighty answered , not displeased .
and wilt taste No pleasure , though in pleasure , solitary .
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed Of happiness , or not ?
I , overjoyed , could not forbear aloud .
Thus have I told thee all my state , and brought My story to the sum of earthly bliss , Which I enjoy ; and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed , but such As , used or not , works in the mind no change , Nor vehement desire ; these delicacies I mean of taste , sight , smell , herbs , fruits , and flowers , Walks , and the melody of birds : but here Far otherwise , transported I behold , Transported touch ; here passion first I felt , Commotion strange !
But , first of all , Him , whom to love is to obey , and keep His great command ; take heed lest passion sway Thy judgement to do aught , which else free will Would not admit : thine , and of all thy sons , The weal or woe in thee is placed ; beware !
So saying , he arose ; whom Adam thus Followed with benediction .
Him after long debate , irresolute Of thoughts revolved , his final sentence chose Fit vessel , fittest imp of fraud , in whom To enter , and his dark suggestions hide From sharpest sight : for , in the wily snake Whatever sleights , none would suspicious mark , As from his wit and native subtlety Proceeding ; which , in other beasts observed , Doubt might beget of diabolick power Active within , beyond the sense of brute .
Terrestrial Heaven , danced round by other Heavens That shine , yet bear their bright officious lamps , Light above light , for thee alone , as seems , In thee concentring all their precious beams Of sacred influence !
As God in Heaven Is center , yet extends to all ; so thou , Centring , receivest from all those orbs : in thee , Not in themselves , all their known virtue appears Productive in herb , plant , and nobler birth Of creatures animate with gradual life Of growth , sense , reason , all summed up in Man .
Subjected to his service angel - wings , And flaming ministers to watch and tend Their earthly charge : Of these the vigilance I dread ; and , to elude , thus wrapt in mist Of midnight vapour glide obscure , and pry In every bush and brake , where hap may find The serpent sleeping ; in whose mazy folds To hide me , and the dark intent I bring .
O foul descent !
Sole Eve , associate sole , to me beyond Compare above all living creatures dear !
His fraud is then thy fear ; which plain infers Thy equal fear , that my firm faith and love Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced ; Thoughts , which how found they harbour in thy breast , Adam , mis - thought of her to thee so dear ?
For such thou art ; from sin and blame entire : Not diffident of thee do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight , but to avoid The attempt itself , intended by our foe .
For he who tempts , though in vain , at least asperses The tempted with dishonour foul ; supposed Not incorruptible of faith , not proof Against temptation : Thou thyself with scorn And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong , Though ineffectual found : misdeem not then , If such affront I labour to avert From thee alone , which on us both at once The enemy , though bold , will hardly dare ; Or daring , first on me the assault shall light .
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel When I am present , and thy trial choose With me , best witness of thy virtue tried ?
But harm precedes not sin : only our foe , Tempting , affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integrity : his foul esteem Sticks no dishonour on our front , but turns Foul on himself ; then wherefore shunned or feared By us ?
Firm we subsist , yet possible to swerve ; Since Reason not impossibly may meet Some specious object by the foe suborned , And fall into deception unaware , Not keeping strictest watch , as she was warned .
But , if thou think , trial unsought may find Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest , Go ; for thy stay , not free , absents thee more ; Go in thy native innocence , rely On what thou hast of virtue ; summon all !
With thy permission then , and thus forewarned Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words Touched only ; that our trial , when least sought , May find us both perhaps far less prepared , The willinger I go , nor much expect A foe so proud will first the weaker seek ; So bent , the more shall shame him his repulse .
Thou never from that hour in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast , or sound repose ; Such ambush , hid among sweet flowers and shades , Waited with hellish rancour imminent To intercept thy way , or send thee back Despoiled of innocence , of faith , of bliss !
For now , and since first break of dawn , the Fiend , Mere serpent in appearance , forth was come ; And on his quest , where likeliest he might find The only two of mankind , but in them The whole included race , his purposed prey .
As one who long in populous city pent , Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air , Forth issuing on a summer ' s morn , to breathe Among the pleasant villages and farms Adjoined , from each thing met conceives delight ; The smell of grain , or tedded grass , or kine , Or dairy , each rural sight , each rural sound ; If chance , with nymph - like step , fair virgin pass , What pleasing seemed , for her now pleases more ; She most , and in her look sums all delight : Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold This flowery plat , the sweet recess of Eve Thus early , thus alone : Her heavenly form Angelick , but more soft , and feminine , Her graceful innocence , her every air Of gesture , or least action , overawed His malice , and with rapine sweet bereaved His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought : That space the Evil - one abstracted stood From his own evil , and for the time remained Stupidly good ; of enmity disarmed , Of guile , of hate , of envy , of revenge : But the hot Hell that always in him burns , Though in mid Heaven , soon ended his delight , And tortures him now more , the more he sees Of pleasure , not for him ordained : then soon Fierce hate he recollects , and all his thoughts Of mischief , gratulating , thus excites .
hate , not love ; nor hope Of Paradise for Hell , hope here to taste Of pleasure ; but all pleasure to destroy , Save what is in destroying ; other joy To me is lost .
The first , at least , of these I thought denied To beasts ; whom God , on their creation - day , Created mute to all articulate sound : The latter I demur ; for in their looks Much reason , and in their actions , oft appears .
Empress of this fair world , resplendent Eve !
now I feel thy power Within me clear ; not only to discern Things in their causes , but to trace the ways Of highest agents , deemed however wise .
and wherein lies The offence , that Man should thus attain to know ?
In the day we eat Of this fair fruit , our doom is , we shall die !
For us alone Was death invented ?
or to us denied This intellectual food , for beasts reserved ?
For beasts it seems : yet that one beast which first Hath tasted envies not , but brings with joy The good befallen him , author unsuspect , Friendly to man , far from deceit or guile .
So saying , from the tree her step she turned ; But first low reverence done , as to the Power That dwelt within , whose presence had infused Into the plant sciential sap , derived From nectar , drink of Gods .
Great joy he promised to his thoughts , and new Solace in her return , so long delayed : Yet oft his heart , divine of something ill , Misgave him ; he the faltering measure felt ; And forth to meet her went , the way she took That morn when first they parted : by the tree Of knowledge he must pass ; there he her met , Scarce from the tree returning ; in her hand A bough of fairest fruit , that downy smiled , New gathered , and ambrosial smell diffused .
Hast thou not wondered , Adam , at my stay ?
Rather , how hast thou yielded to transgress The strict forbiddance , how to violate The sacred fruit forbidden !
Some cursed fraud Of enemy hath beguiled thee , yet unknown , And me with thee hath ruined ; for with thee Certain my resolution is to die : How can I live without thee !
So Adam ; and thus Eve to him replied .
Much pleasure we have lost , while we abstained From this delightful fruit , nor known till now True relish , tasting ; if such pleasure be In things to us forbidden , it might be wished , For this one tree had been forbidden ten .
So rose the Danite strong , Herculean Samson , from the harlot - lap Of Philistean Dalilah , and waked Shorn of his strength .
Thus fenced , and , as they thought , their shame in part Covered , but not at rest or ease of mind , They sat them down to weep ; nor only tears Rained at their eyes , but high winds worse within Began to rise , high passions , anger , hate , Mistrust , suspicion , discord ; and shook sore Their inward state of mind , calm region once And full of peace , now tost and turbulent : For Understanding ruled not , and the Will Heard not her lore ; both in subjection now To sensual Appetite , who from beneath Usurping over sovran Reason claimed Superiour sway : From thus distempered breast , Adam , estranged in look and altered style , Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed .
Imputest thou that to my default , or will Of wandering , as thou callest it , which who knows But might as ill have happened thou being by , Or to thyself perhaps ?
Too facile then , thou didst not much gainsay ; Nay , didst permit , approve , and fair dismiss .
the penalty ; And , manifold in sin , deserved to fall .
About the new - arrived , in multitudes The ethereal people ran , to hear and know How all befel : They towards the throne supreme , Accountable , made haste , to make appear , With righteous plea , their utmost vigilance And easily approved ; when the Most High Eternal Father , from his secret cloud , Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice .
To thee I have transferred All judgement , whether in Heaven , or Earth , or Hell .
Down he descended straight ; the speed of Gods Time counts not , though with swiftest minutes winged .
He came ; and with him Eve , more loth , though first To offend ; discountenanced both , and discomposed ; Love was not in their looks , either to God , Or to each other ; but apparent guilt , And shame , and perturbation , and despair , Anger , and obstinacy , and hate , and guile .
in evil strait this day I stand Before my Judge ; either to undergo Myself the total crime , or to accuse My other self , the partner of my life ; Whose failing , while her faith to me remains , I should conceal , and not expose to blame By my complaint : but strict necessity Subdues me , and calamitous constraint ; Lest on my head both sin and punishment , However insupportable , be all Devolved ; though should I hold my peace , yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceal .-- This Woman , whom thou madest to be my help , And gavest me as thy perfect gift , so good , So fit , so acceptable , so divine , That from her hand I could suspect no ill , And what she did , whatever in itself , Her doing seemed to justify the deed ; She gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied .
Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply By thy conception ; children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth ; and to thy husband ' s will Thine shall submit ; he over thee shall rule .
Satan , in likeness of an Angel bright , Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering His zenith , while the sun in Aries rose : Disguised he came ; but those his children dear Their parent soon discerned , though in disguise .
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair Too soon arrived ; Sin , there in power before , Once actual ; now in body , and to dwell Habitual habitant ; behind her Death , Close following pace for pace , not mounted yet On his pale horse : to whom Sin thus began .
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure To sanctity , that shall receive no stain : Till then , the curse pronounced on both precedes .
Who of all ages to succeed , but , feeling The evil on him brought by me , will curse My head ?
Can he make deathless death ?
So disinherited , how would you bless Me , now your curse !
How can they then acquitted stand In sight of God ?
O Conscience !
into what abyss of fears And horrours hast thou driven me ; out of which I find no way , from deep to deeper plunged !
That name best Befits thee with him leagued , thyself as false And hateful ; nothing wants , but that thy shape , Like his , and colour serpentine , may show Thy inward fraud ; to warn all creatures from thee Henceforth ; lest that too heavenly form , pretended To hellish falshood , snare them !
But rise ;-- let us no more contend , nor blame Each other , blamed enough elsewhere ; but strive In offices of love , how we may lighten Each other ' s burden , in our share of woe ; Since this day ' s death denounced , if aught I see , Will prove no sudden , but a slow - paced evil ; A long day ' s dying , to augment our pain ; And to our seed ( O hapless seed !)
derived .
Childless thou art , childless remain : so Death Shall be deceived his glut , and with us two Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw .
So spake our father penitent ; nor Eve Felt less remorse : they , forthwith to the place Repairing where he judged them , prostrate fell Before him reverent ; and both confessed Humbly their faults , and pardon begged ; with tears Watering the ground , and with their sighs the air Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign Of sorrow unfeigned , and humiliation meek .
Mean while , To re - salute the world with sacred light , Leucothea waked ; and with fresh dews imbalmed The earth ; when Adam and first matron Eve Had ended now their orisons , and found Strength added from above ; new hope to spring Out of despair ; joy , but with fear yet linked ; Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed .
For since I sought By prayer the offended Deity to appease ; Kneeled , and before him humbled all my heart ; Methought I saw him placable and mild , Bending his ear ; persuasion in me grew That I was heard with favour ; peace returned Home to my breast , and to my memory His promise , that thy seed shall bruise our foe ; Which , then not minded in dismay , yet now Assures me that the bitterness of death Is past , and we shall live .
Adam , Heaven ' s high behest no preface needs : Sufficient that thy prayers are heard ; and Death , Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress , Defeated of his seisure many days Given thee of grace ; wherein thou mayest repent , And one bad act with many deeds well done Mayest cover : Well may then thy Lord , appeased , Redeem thee quite from Death ' s rapacious claim ; But longer in this Paradise to dwell Permits not : to remove thee I am come , And send thee from the garden forth to till The ground whence thou wast taken , fitter soil .
how shall we breathe in other air Less pure , accustomed to immortal fruits ?
all places else Inhospitable appear , and desolate ; Nor knowing us , nor known : And , if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of Him who all things can , I would not cease To weary him with my assiduous cries : But prayer against his absolute decree No more avails than breath against the wind , Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth : Therefore to his great bidding I submit .
Ascend , I follow thee , safe Guide , the path Thou leadest me ; and to the hand of Heaven submit , However chastening ; to the evil turn My obvious breast ; arming to overcome By suffering , and earn rest from labour won , If so I may attain .
His eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern fame , the seat Of mightiest empire , from the destined walls Of Cambalu , seat of Cathaian Can , And Samarchand by Oxus , Temir ' s throne , To Paquin of Sinaean kings ; and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul , Down to the golden Chersonese ; or where The Persian in Ecbatan sat , or since In Hispahan ; or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco ; or the Sultan in Bizance , Turchestan - born ; nor could his eye not ken The empire of Negus to his utmost port Ercoco , and the less maritim kings Mombaza , and Quiloa , and Melind , And Sofala , thought Ophir , to the realm Of Congo , and Angola farthest south ; Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount The kingdoms of Almansor , Fez and Sus , Morocco , and Algiers , and Tremisen ; On Europe thence , and where Rome was to sway The world : in spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico , the seat of Montezume , And Cusco in Peru , the richer seat Of Atabalipa ; and yet unspoiled Guiana , whose great city Geryon ' s sons Call El Dorado .
His eyes he opened , and beheld a field , Part arable and tilth , whereon were sheaves New reaped ; the other part sheep - walks and folds ; I ' the midst an altar as the land - mark stood , Rustick , of grassy sord ; thither anon A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought First fruits , the green ear , and the yellow sheaf , Unculled , as came to hand ; a shepherd next , More meek , came with the firstlings of his flock , Choicest and best ; then , sacrificing , laid The inwards and their fat , with incense strowed , On the cleft wood , and all due rights performed : His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven Consumed with nimble glance , and grateful steam ; The other ' s not , for his was not sincere ; Whereat he inly raged , and , as they talked , Smote him into the midriff with a stone That beat out life ; he fell ; and , deadly pale , Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused .
These two are brethren , Adam , and to come Out of thy loins ; the unjust the just hath slain , For envy that his brother ' s offering found From Heaven acceptance ; but the bloody fact Will be avenged ; and the other ' s faith , approved , Lose no reward ; though here thou see him die , Rolling in dust and gore .
Alas !
both for the deed , and for the cause !
Death thou hast seen In his first shape on Man ; but many shapes Of Death , and many are the ways that lead To his grim cave , all dismal ; yet to sense More terrible at the entrance , than within .
Some , as thou sawest , by violent stroke shall die ; By fire , flood , famine , by intemperance more In meats and drinks , which on the earth shall bring Diseases dire , of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear ; that thou mayest know What misery the inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on Men .
Adam could not , but wept , Though not of woman born ; compassion quelled His best of man , and gave him up to tears A space , till firmer thoughts restrained excess ; And , scarce recovering words , his plaint renewed .
O miserable mankind , to what fall Degraded , to what wretched state reserved !
In other part stood one who , at the forge Labouring , two massy clods of iron and brass Had melted , ( whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale , Down to the veins of earth ; thence gliding hot To some cave ' s mouth ; or whether washed by stream From underground ;) the liquid ore he drained Into fit moulds prepared ; from which he formed First his own tools ; then , what might else be wrought Fusil or graven in metal .
After these , But on the hither side , a different sort From the high neighbouring hills , which was their seat , Down to the plain descended ; by their guise Just men they seemed , and all their study bent To worship God aright , and know his works Not hid ; nor those things last , which might preserve Freedom and peace to Men ; they on the plain Long had not walked , when from the tents , behold !
Such happy interview , and fair event Of love and youth not lost , songs , garlands , flowers , And charming symphonies , attached the heart Of Adam , soon inclined to admit delight , The bent of nature ; which he thus expressed .
Judge not what is best By pleasure , though to nature seeming meet ; Created , as thou art , to nobler end Holy and pure , conformity divine .
Those tents thou sawest so pleasant , were the tents Of wickedness , wherein shall dwell his race Who slew his brother ; studious they appear Of arts that polish life , inventers rare ; Unmindful of their Maker , though his Spirit Taught them ; but they his gifts acknowledged none .
From Man ' s effeminate slackness it begins , Said the Angel , who should better hold his place By wisdom , and superiour gifts received .
But now prepare thee for another scene .
To whom thus Michael .
At length a reverend sire among them came , And of their doings great dislike declared , And testified against their ways ; he oft Frequented their assemblies , whereso met , Triumphs or festivals ; and to them preached Conversion and repentance , as to souls In prison , under judgements imminent : But all in vain : which when he saw , he ceased Contending , and removed his tents far off ; Then , from the mountain hewing timber tall , Began to build a vessel of huge bulk ; Measured by cubit , length , and breadth , and highth ; Smeared round with pitch ; and in the side a door Contrived ; and of provisions laid in large , For man and beast : when lo , a wonder strange !
How comes it thus ?
To whom thus Michael .
Whereat the heart of Adam , erst so sad , Greatly rejoiced ; and thus his joy broke forth .
Or serve they , as a flowery verge , to bind The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud , Lest it again dissolve , and shower the earth ?
Book XII
He with a crew , whom like ambition joins With him or under him to tyrannize , Marching from Eden towards the west , shall find The plain , wherein a black bituminous gurge Boils out from under ground , the mouth of Hell : Of brick , and of that stuff , they cast to build A city and tower , whose top may reach to Heaven ; And get themselves a name ; lest , far dispersed In foreign lands , their memory be lost ; Regardless whether good or evil fame .
O execrable son !
This yet I apprehend not , why to those Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth So many and so various laws are given ; So many laws argue so many sins Among them ; how can God with such reside ?
Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on earth , than certain times to appear To his disciples , men who in his life Still followed him ; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learned And his salvation ; them who shall believe Baptizing in the profluent stream , the sign Of washing them from guilt of sin to life Pure , and in mind prepared , if so befall , For death , like that which the Redeemer died .
O Goodness infinite , Goodness immense !
To whom thus also the Angel last replied .
He ended , and they both descend the hill ; Descended , Adam to the bower , where Eve Lay sleeping , ran before ; but found her waked ; And thus with words not sad she him received .

Truly sir , all that I liue by , is with the Aule : I meddle with no Tradesmans matters , nor womens matters ; but withal I am indeed Sir , a Surgeon to old shooes : when they are in great danger , I recouer them .
But indeede sir , we make Holyday to see Caesar , and to reioyce in his Triumph
You Blockes , you stones , you worse then senslesse things : O you hard hearts , you cruell men of Rome , Knew you not Pompey many a time and oft ?
It is no matter , let no Images Be hung with Caesars Trophees : Ile about , And driue away the Vulgar from the streets ; So do you too , where you perceiue them thicke .
Enter Caesar , Antony for the Course , Calphurnia , Portia , Decius , Cicero , Brutus , Cassius , Caska , a Soothsayer : after them Murellus and Flauius .
Peace ho , Caesar speakes
Calphurnia
Heere my Lord
Stand you directly in Antonio ' s way , When he doth run his course .

If it be ought toward the generall good , Set Honor in one eye , and Death i ' th other , And I will looke on both indifferently : For let the Gods so speed mee , as I loue The name of Honor , more then I feare death
Cassi .
The Torrent roar ' d , and we did buffet it With lusty Sinewes , throwing it aside , And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie .
I ( as Aeneas , our great Ancestor , Did from the Flames of Troy , vpon his shoulder The old Anchyses beare ) so , from the waues of Tyber Did I the tyred Caesar : And this Man , Is now become a God , and Cassius is A wretched Creature , and must bend his body , If Caesar carelesly but nod on him .
Cassi .
Men at sometime , are Masters of their Fates .

Caes Let me haue men about me , that are fat , Sleeke - headed men , and such as sleepe a - nights : Yond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke , He thinkes too much : such men are dangerous
He reades much , He is a great Obseruer , and he lookes Quite through the Deeds of men .

Was the Crowne offer ' d him thrice ?
I marry was ' t , and hee put it by thrice , euerie time gentler then other ; and at euery putting by , mine honest Neighbors showted
Cask .
He fell downe in the Market - place , and foam ' d at mouth , and was speechlesse
And after that , he came thus sad away
Did Cicero say any thing ?
Cassi .
To what effect ?
I could tell you more newes too : Murrellus and Flauius , for pulling Scarffes off Caesars Images , are put to silence .
Fare you well .
Will you suppe with me to Night , Caska ?
Cask .
What a blunt fellow is this growne to be ?
Why are you breathlesse , and why stare you so ?
Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen , Or else the World , too sawcie with the Gods , Incenses them to send destruction

For my part , I haue walk ' d about the streets , Submitting me vnto the perillous Night ; And thus vnbraced , Caska , as you see , Haue bar ' d my Bosome to the Thunder - stone : And when the crosse blew Lightning seem ' d to open The Brest of Heauen , I did present my selfe Euen in the ayme , and very flash of it
Let it be who it is : for Romans now Haue Thewes , and Limbes , like to their Ancestors ; But woe the while , our Fathers mindes are dead , And we are gouern ' d with our Mothers spirits , Our yoake , and sufferance , shew vs Womanish
Indeed , they say , the Senators to morrow Meane to establish Caesar as a King : And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea , and Land , In euery place , saue here in Italy
Thunder still .

Hold , my Hand : Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes , And I will set this foot of mine as farre , As who goes farthest

What Lucius , hoe ?
I would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly .
When Lucius , when ?
awake , I say : what Lucius ?
I will , my Lord .
He would be crown ' d : How that might change his nature , there ' s the question ?
It is the bright day , that brings forth the Adder , And that craues warie walking : Crowne him that , And then I graunt we put a Sting in him , That at his will he may doe danger with .
But ' tis a common proofe , That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder , Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face : But when he once attaines the vpmost Round , He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe , Lookes in the Clouds , scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend : so Caesar may ; Then least he may , preuent .
Luc .
Opens the Letter , and reades .
Brutus thou sleep ' st ; awake , and see thy selfe : Shall Rome , & c . speake , strike , redresse .
Brutus , thou sleep ' st : awake .
Am I entreated To speake , and strike ?
I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest : Good morrow Brutus , doe we trouble you ?
They are all welcome .
O pardon , Sir , it doth ; and yon grey Lines , That fret the Clouds , are Messengers of Day
You shall confesse , that you are both deceiu ' d : Heere , as I point my Sword , the Sunne arises , Which is a great way growing on the South , Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare .
Giue me your hands all ouer , one by one
Bru .
And you know , his meanes If he improue them , may well stretch so farre As to annoy vs all : which to preuent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together

Yet Caesar shall go forth : for these Predictions Are to the world in generall , as to Caesar
What say the Augurers ?
Deci .
Most mighty Caesar , let me know some cause , Lest I be laught at when I tell them so
This by Calphurnia ' s Dreame is signified
I haue , when you haue heard what I can say : And know it now , the Senate haue concluded To giue this day , a Crowne to mighty Caesar .
If Caesar hide himselfe , shall they not whisper Loe Caesar is affraid ?
Pardon me Caesar , for my deere deere loue To your proceeding , bids me tell you this : And reason to my loue is liable
Good morrow Caska : Caius Ligarius , Caesar was ne ' re so much your enemy , As that same Ague which hath made you leane .

Metel .
Is there no voyce more worthy then my owne , To sound more sweetly in great Caesars eare , For the repealing of my banish ' d Brother ?

But heere ' s a Parchment , with the Seale of Caesar , I found it in his Closset , ' tis his Will : Let but the Commons heare this Testament : ( Which pardon me ) I do not meane to reade , And they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds , And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood ; Yea , begge a haire of him for Memory , And dying , mention it within their Willes , Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie Vnto their issue

As thou art to thy selfe , Such was the very Armour he had on , When th ' Ambitious Norwey combatted : So frown ' d he once , when in an angry parle He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice .
' Tis strange
Good now sit downe , & tell me he that knowes Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch , So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land , And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre : Why such impresse of Ship - wrights , whose sore Taske Do ' s not diuide the Sunday from the weeke , What might be toward , that this sweaty hast Doth make the Night ioynt - Labourer with the day : Who is ' t that can informe me ?
Enter Ghost againe .
If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate ( Which happily foreknowing may auoyd ) Oh speake .

Hor .
And of the truth heerein , This present Obiect made probation
Let do ' t I pray , and I this morning know Where we shall finde him most conueniently .
Exeunt .
King .
Now for our selfe , and for this time of meeting Thus much the businesse is .
In that the Leuies , The Lists , and full proportions are all made Out of his subiect : and we heere dispatch You good Cornelius , and you Voltemand , For bearing of this greeting to old Norway , Giuing to you no further personall power To businesse with the King , more then the scope Of these dilated Articles allow : Farewell , and let your hast commend your duty
In that , and all things , will we shew our duty
You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane , And loose your voyce .
Haue you your Fathers leaue ?
Seemes Madam ?

Ham .
Ham .
O God , O God !
Oh fie , fie , ' tis an vnweeded Garden That growes to Seed : Things rank , and grosse in Nature Possesse it meerely .

Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes , She married .
The same my Lord , And your poore Seruant euer
Hor .
Ham .
Oh where my Lord ?
In my minds eye ( Horatio ) Hor .
I saw him once ; he was a goodly King
This to me In dreadfull secrecie impart they did , And I with them the third Night kept the Watch , Whereas they had deliuer ' d both in time , Forme of the thing ; each word made true and good , The Apparition comes .
Ham .
Hold you the watch to Night ?
We doe my Lord
Ham .
Then saw you not his face ?
And fixt his eyes vpon you ?
Hor .
Longer , longer
no
Ham .
Our duty to your Honour .
Your loue , as mine to you : farewell .
Laer .
Doe you doubt that ?
For Hamlet , and the trifling of his fauours , Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude ; A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature ; Froward , not permanent ; sweet not lasting The suppliance of a minute ?
The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough , If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone : Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes , The Canker Galls , the Infants of the Spring Too oft before the buttons be disclos ' d , And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth , Contagious blastments are most imminent .
Polon .
Aboord , aboord for shame , The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile , And you are staid for there : my blessing with you ; And these few Precepts in thy memory , See thou Character .
Giue thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any vnproportion ' d thoughts his Act : Be thou familiar ; but by no meanes vulgar : The friends thou hast , and their adoption tride , Grapple them to thy Soule , with hoopes of Steele : But doe not dull thy palme , with entertainment Of each vnhatch ' t , vnfledg ' d Comrade .
Most humbly doe I take my leaue , my Lord
Marry , well bethought : Tis told me he hath very oft of late Giuen priuate time to you ; and you your selfe Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous .
Affection , puh .
Polon .
Marry Ile teach you ; thinke your selfe a Baby , That you haue tane his tenders for true pay , Which are not starling .
Tender your selfe more dearly ; Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase , Roaming it thus , you ' l tender me a foole
For Lord Hamlet , Beleeue so much in him , that he is young , And with a larger tether may he walke , Then may be giuen you .
I shall obey my Lord .
Enter Hamlet , Horatio , Marcellus .
What hower now ?
I thinke it lacks of twelue
No , it is strooke
Is it a custome ?
Ham .
I marry ist ; And to my mind , though I am natiue heere , And to the manner borne : It is a Custome More honour ' d in the breach , then the obseruance .
Mar .
Hor .
It will not speake : then will I follow it
Hor .
What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord ?
It wafts me still : goe on , Ile follow thee
Let ' s follow ; ' tis not fit thus to obey him
Heauen will direct it
Enter Ghost and Hamlet .
Gho .
I will
Gho .
Ghost .
O my Propheticke soule : mine Vncle ?
But Vertue , as it neuer wil be moued , Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen : So Lust , though to a radiant Angell link ' d , Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed , & prey on Garbage .
Thus was I , sleeping , by a Brothers hand , Of Life , of Crowne , and Queene at once dispatcht ; Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne , Vnhouzzled , disappointed , vnnaneld , No reckoning made , but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head ; Oh horrible Oh horrible , most horrible : If thou hast nature in thee beare it not ; Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest .
Heauen secure him
What newes , my Lord ?
Oh wonderfull !
Not I , my Lord , by Heauen
How say you then , would heart of man once think it ?
Both .

There are more things in Heauen and Earth , Horatio , Then are dream ' t of in our Philosophy .

My Lord , I did intend it
My Lord that would dishonour him
According to the Phrase and the Addition , Of man and Country
He does : what was I about to say ?
God buy you ; fare you well
I shall my Lord
Enter Ophelia .
Ophe .
Ophe .
Long staid he so , At last , a little shaking of mine Arme : And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe ; He rais ' d a sigh , so pittious and profound , That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke , And end his being .
That done , he lets me goe , And with his head ouer his shoulders turn ' d , He seem ' d to finde his way without his eyes , For out adores he went without their helpe ; And to the last , bended their light on me
No my good Lord : but as you did command , I did repell his Letters , and deny ' de His accesse to me
Pol .
I feare he did but trifle , And meant to wracke thee : but beshrew my iealousie : It seemes it is as proper to our Age , To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions , As it is common for the yonger sort To lacke discretion .
Something haue you heard Of Hamlets transformation : so I call it , Since not th ' exterior , nor the inward man Resembles that it was .

Welcome good Frends : Say Voltumand , what from our Brother Norwey ?
Pol .
Madam , I sweare I vse no Art at all : That he is mad , ' tis true : ' Tis true ' tis pittie , And pittie it is true : A foolish figure , But farewell it : for I will vse no Art .
O deere Ophelia , I am ill at these Numbers : I haue not Art to reckon my grones ; but that I loue thee best , oh most Best beleeue it .

At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him , Be you and I behinde an Arras then , Marke the encounter : If he loue her not , And be not from his reason falne thereon ; Let me be no Assistant for a State , And keepe a Farme and Carters

For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge , being a good kissing Carrion - Haue you a daughter ?

Oh , Rosincrane ; good Lads : How doe ye both ?

Why then ' tis none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so : to me it is a prison
That you must teach me : but let mee coniure you by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the Obligation of our euer - preserued loue , and by what more deare , a better proposer could charge you withall ; be euen and direct with me , whether you were sent for or no
Nay then I haue an eye of you : if you loue me hold not off
My Lord , we were sent for

The Spirit that I haue seene May be the Diuell , and the Diuel hath power T ' assume a pleasing shape , yea and perhaps Out of my Weaknesse , and my Melancholly , As he is very potent with such Spirits , Abuses me to damne me .
Enter King , Queene , Polonius , Ophelia , Rosincrance , Guildenstern , and Lords .
Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded , But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe : When we would bring him on to some Confession Of his true state
Qu .
Rosin .
But with much forcing of his disposition
Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply
Madam , it so fell out , that certaine Players We ore - wrought on the way : of these we told him , And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy To heare of it : They are about the Court , And ( as I thinke ) they haue already order This night to play before him
Good Gentlemen , Giue him a further edge , and driue his purpose on To these delights
I shall obey you , And for your part Ophelia , I do wish That your good Beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlets wildenesse : so shall I hope your Vertues Will bring him to his wonted way againe , To both your Honors
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all , And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution Is sicklied o ' re , with the pale cast of Thought , And enterprizes of great pith and moment , With this regard their Currants turne away , And loose the name of Action .

My Lord , do as you please , But if you hold it fit after the Play , Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him To shew his Greefes : let her be round with him , And Ile be plac ' d so , please you in the eare Of all their Conference .
If she finde him not , To England send him : Or confine him where Your wisedome best shall thinke

Come hither my good Hamlet , sit by me

So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone Make vs againe count o ' re , ere loue be done .
But woe is me , you are so sicke of late , So farre from cheere , and from your former state , That I distrust you : yet though I distrust , Discomfort you ( my Lord ) it nothing must : For womens Feare and Loue , holds quantitie , In neither ought , or in extremity : Now what my loue is , proofe hath made you know , And as my Loue is siz ' d , my Feare is so
King .
Nor Earth to giue me food , nor Heauen light , Sport and repose locke from me day and night : Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy , Meet what I would haue well , and it destroy : Both heere , and hence , pursue me lasting strife , If once a Widdow , euer I be Wife
If she should breake it now
The Lady protests to much me thinkes
Pox , leaue thy damnable Faces , and begin .
Exeunt .
Why let the strucken Deere go weepe , The Hart vngalled play : For some must watch , while some must sleepe ; So runnes the world away .

Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer , to signifie this to his Doctor : for for me to put him to his Purgation , would perhaps plundge him into farre more Choller
Good my Lord put your discourse into some frame , and start not so wildely from my affayre
The Queene your Mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you

But sir , such answers as I can make , you shal command : or rather you say , my Mother : therfore no more but to the matter .

Why do you thinke , that I am easier to bee plaid on , then a Pipe ?

Whereto serues mercy , But to confront the visage of Offence ?
Then Ile looke vp , My fault is past .

Why look you there : looke how it steals away : My Father in his habite , as he liued , Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall .

But if not , Be you content to lend your patience to vs , And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule To giue it due content

Shall I redeliuer you ee ' n so ?
To this effect Sir , after what flourish your nature will
Nay , good my Lord
It is but foolery ; but it is such a kinde of gain - giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman
This presence knowes , And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht With sore distraction ?

So please you , it is true : our Thane is comming : One of my fellowes had the speed of him ; Who almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Then would make vp his Message
Giue him tending , He brings great newes ,

Heere , But heere , vpon this Banke and Schoole of time , Wee ' ld iumpe the life to come .
Besides , this Duncane Hath borne his Faculties so meeke ; hath bin So cleere in his great Office , that his Vertues Will pleade like Angels , Trumpet - tongu ' d against The deepe damnation of his taking off : And Pitty , like a naked New - borne - Babe , Striding the blast , or Heauens Cherubin , hors ' d Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre , Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye , That teares shall drowne the winde .

} One ' s - Self I Sing
Be it so , then I answer ' d , I too haughty Shade also sing war , and a longer and greater one than any , Waged in my book with varying fortune , with flight , advance and retreat , victory deferr ' d and wavering , ( Yet methinks certain , or as good as certain , at the last ,) the field the world , For life and death , for the Body and for the eternal Soul , Lo , I too am come , chanting the chant of battles , I above all promote brave soldiers .
thou centre !
The ostent evanescent , The substance of an artist ' s mood or savan ' s studies long , Or warrior ' s , martyr ' s , hero ' s toils , To fashion his eidolon .
And thee my soul , Joys , ceaseless exercises , exaltations , Thy yearning amply fed at last , prepared to meet , Thy mates , eidolons .
} Beginning My Studies
} Beginners
On journeys through the States we start , ( Ay through the world , urged by these songs , Sailing henceforth to every land , to every sea ,) We willing learners of all , teachers of all , and lovers of all .

} I Hear America Singing
I hear America singing , the varied carols I hear , Those of mechanics , each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong , The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam , The mason singing his as he makes ready for work , or leaves off work , The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat , the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck , The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench , the hatter singing as he stands , The wood - cutter ' s song , the ploughboy ' s on his way in the morning , or at noon intermission or at sundown , The delicious singing of the mother , or of the young wife at work , or of the girl sewing or washing , Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else , The day what belongs to the day -- at night the party of young fellows , robust , friendly , Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs .
for you must justify me .
} To You
} Starting from Paumanok
3 Americanos !
omnes !
I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be their religion , Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur ; ( Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion , Nor land nor man or woman without religion .)
Are you so earnest , so given up to literature , science , art , amours ?
My comrade !
O such themes -- equalities !
near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing .
13 Was somebody asking to see the soul ?
Of your real body and any man ' s or woman ' s real body , Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse - cleaners and pass to fitting spheres , Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death .
Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet ?
Toward the male of the States , and toward the female of the States , Exulting words , words to Democracy ' s lands .
Land of wheat , beef , pork !
land of wool and hemp !
the feminine !
O all and each well - loved by me !
Must not Nature be persuaded many times ?)
O music wild !
} Song of Myself
2 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes , the shelves are crowded with perfumes , I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it , The distillation would intoxicate me also , but I shall not let it .
The atmosphere is not a perfume , it has no taste of the distillation , it is odorless , It is for my mouth forever , I am in love with it , I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked , I am mad for it to be in contact with me .
The sound of the belch ' d words of my voice loos ' d to the eddies of the wind , A few light kisses , a few embraces , a reaching around of arms , The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag , The delight alone or in the rush of the streets , or along the fields and hill - sides , The feeling of health , the full - noon trill , the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun .
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems ?
Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems , You shall possess the good of the earth and sun , ( there are millions of suns left ,) You shall no longer take things at second or third hand , nor look through the eyes of the dead , nor feed on the spectres in books , You shall not look through my eyes either , nor take things from me , You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self .
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning , How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn ' d over upon me , And parted the shirt from my bosom - bone , and plunged your tongue to my bare - stript heart , And reach ' d till you felt my beard , and reach ' d till you held my feet .
And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves .
Undrape !
The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom , I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair , I note where the pistol has fallen .
The boatmen and clam - diggers arose early and stopt for me , I tuck ' d my trowser - ends in my boots and went and had a good time ; You should have been with us that day round the chowder - kettle .
for I see you , You splash in the water there , yet stay stock still in your room .
Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil , Each has his main - sledge , they are all out , there is a great heat in the fire .
I behold the picturesque giant and love him , and I do not stop there , I go with the team also .
14 The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night , Ya - honk he says , and sounds it down to me like an invitation , The pert may suppose it meaningless , but I listening close , Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky .
I am enamour ' d of growing out - doors , Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods , Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls , and the drivers of horses , I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out .
What is a man anyhow ?
All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own , Else it were time lost listening to me .
why should I venerate and be ceremonious ?
I know I am deathless , I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter ' s compass , I know I shall not pass like a child ' s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night .
Still nodding night -- mad naked summer night .
I resign myself to you also -- I guess what you mean , I behold from the beach your crooked fingers , I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me , We must have a turn together , I undress , hurry me out of sight of the land , Cushion me soft , rock me in billowy drowse , Dash me with amorous wet , I can repay you .
What behaved well in the past or behaves well to - day is not such wonder , The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel .
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs !
Through me the afflatus surging and surging , through me the current and index .
I do not press my fingers across my mouth , I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart , Copulation is no more rank to me than death is .
Root of wash ' d sweet - flag !
it shall be you !
Sun so generous it shall be you !
Winds whose soft - tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you !
To behold the day - break !
We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun , We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak .
Writing and talk do not prove me , I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face , With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic .
I hear the violoncello , (' tis the young man ' s heart ' s complaint ,) I hear the key ' d cornet , it glides quickly in through my ears , It shakes mad - sweet pangs through my belly and breast .
I hear the train ' d soprano ( what work with hers is this ?)
Mine is no callous shell , I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop , They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me .
28 Is this then a touch ?
quivering me to a new identity , Flames and ether making a rush for my veins , Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them , My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself , On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs , Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip , Behaving licentious toward me , taking no denial , Depriving me of my best as for a purpose , Unbuttoning my clothes , holding me by the bare waist , Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture - fields , Immodestly sliding the fellow - senses away , They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me , No consideration , no regard for my draining strength or my anger , Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while , Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me .
what are you doing ?
( Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so , Only what nobody denies is so .)
So they show their relations to me and I accept them , They bring me tokens of myself , they evince them plainly in their possession .
34 Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth , ( I tell not the fall of Alamo , Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo , The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo ,) ' Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men .
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars ?
We closed with him , the yards entangled , the cannon touch ' d , My captain lash ' d fast with his own hands .
Not a moment ' s cease , The leaks gain fast on the pumps , the fire eats toward the powder - magazine .
Not a mutineer walks handcuff ' d to jail but I am handcuff ' d to him and walk by his side , ( I am less the jolly one there , and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips .)
You light surfaces only , I force surfaces and depths also .
you seem to look for something at my hands , Say , old top - knot , what do you want ?
Man or woman , I might tell how I like you , but cannot , And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you , but cannot , And might tell that pining I have , that pulse of my nights and days .
( This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics .)
To any one dying , thither I speed and twist the knob of the door .
Turn the bed - clothes toward the foot of the bed , Let the physician and the priest go home .
41 I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs , And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help .
I heard what was said of the universe , Heard it and heard it of several thousand years ; It is middling well as far as it goes -- but is that all ?
hoot !
The black ship mail ' d with iron , her mighty guns in her turrets -- but the pluck of the captain and engineers ?
The sky up there -- yet here or next door , or across the way ?
Down - hearted doubters dull and excluded , Frivolous , sullen , moping , angry , affected , dishearten ' d , atheistical , I know every one of you , I know the sea of torment , doubt , despair and unbelief .
It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried , Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side , Nor the little child that peep ' d in at the door , and then drew back and was never seen again , Nor the old man who has lived without purpose , and feels it with bitterness worse than gall , Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder , Nor the numberless slaughter ' d and wreck ' d , nor the brutish koboo call ' d the ordure of humanity , Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in , Nor any thing in the earth , or down in the oldest graves of the earth , Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres , nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them , Nor the present , nor the least wisp that is known .
What is known I strip away , I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown .
ever - push ' d elasticity !
O welcome , ineffable grace of dying days !
There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage , If I , you , and the worlds , and all beneath or upon their surfaces , were this moment reduced back to a pallid float , it would not avail the long run , We should surely bring up again where we now stand , And surely go as much farther , and then farther and farther .
A few quadrillions of eras , a few octillions of cubic leagues , do not hazard the span or make it impatient , They are but parts , any thing is but a part .
I tramp a perpetual journey , ( come listen all !)
My signs are a rain - proof coat , good shoes , and a staff cut from the woods , No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair , I have no chair , no church , no philosophy , I lead no man to a dinner - table , library , exchange , But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll , My left hand hooking you round the waist , My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road .
Long enough have you dream ' d contemptible dreams , Now I wash the gum from your eyes , You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life .
The boy I love , the same becomes a man not through derived power , but in his own right , Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear , Fond of his sweetheart , relishing well his steak , Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts , First - rate to ride , to fight , to hit the bull ' s eye , to sail a skiff , to sing a song or play on the banjo , Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small - pox over all latherers , And those well - tann ' d to those that keep out of the sun .
To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes , I see the elder - hand pressing receiving supporting , I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors , And mark the outlet , and mark the relief and escape .
Do you see O my brothers and sisters ?
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future .
Who has done his day ' s work ?
I too am not a bit tamed , I too am untranslatable , I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world .
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean , But I shall be good health to you nevertheless , And filter and fibre your blood .
The oath of the inseparableness of two together , of the woman that loves me and whom I love more than my life , that oath swearing , ( O I willingly stake all for you , O let me be lost if it must be so !
only that we enjoy each other and exhaust each other if it must be so ;) From the master , the pilot I yield the vessel to , The general commanding me , commanding all , from him permission taking , From time the programme hastening , ( I have loiter ' d too long as it is ,) From sex , from the warp and from the woof , From privacy , from frequent repinings alone , From plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near , From the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers through my hair and beard , From the long sustain ' d kiss upon the mouth or bosom , From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk , fainting with excess , From what the divine husband knows , from the work of fatherhood , From exultation , victory and relief , from the bedfellow ' s embrace in the night , From the act - poems of eyes , hands , hips and bosoms , From the cling of the trembling arm , From the bending curve and the clinch , From side by side the pliant coverlet off - throwing , From the one so unwilling to have me leave , and me just as unwilling to leave , ( Yet a moment O tender waiter , and I return ,) From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews , From the night a moment I emerging flitting out , Celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for , And you stalwart loins .

5 This is the female form , A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot , It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction , I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor , all falls aside but myself and it , Books , art , religion , time , the visible and solid earth , and what was expected of heaven or fear ' d of hell , are now consumed , Mad filaments , ungovernable shoots play out of it , the response likewise ungovernable , Hair , bosom , hips , bend of legs , negligent falling hands all diffused , mine too diffused , Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb , love - flesh swelling and deliciously aching , Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous , quivering jelly of love , white - blow and delirious nice , Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn , Undulating into the willing and yielding day , Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet - flesh ' d day .
This the nucleus -- after the child is born of woman , man is born of woman , This the bath of birth , this the merge of small and large , and the outlet again .
As I see my soul reflected in Nature , As I see through a mist , One with inexpressible completeness , sanity , beauty , See the bent head and arms folded over the breast , the Female I see .
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well - off , just as much as you , Each has his or her place in the procession .
Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant ?
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight , and he or she has no right to a sight ?
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float , and the soil is on the surface , and water runs and vegetation sprouts , For you only , and not for him and her ?
Gentlemen look on this wonder , Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it , For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant , For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll ' d .
Exquisite senses , life - lit eyes , pluck , volition , Flakes of breast - muscle , pliant backbone and neck , flesh not flabby , good - sized arms and legs , And wonders within there yet .
How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries ?
Have you ever loved the body of a woman ?
For they do not conceal themselves , and cannot conceal themselves .
O furious !
O bashful and feminine !
To find a new unthought - of nonchalance with the best of Nature !
To have the feeling to - day or any day I am sufficient as I am .
With one brief hour of madness and joy .
Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me , Whispering I love you , before long I die , I have travel ' d a long way merely to look on you to touch you , For I could not die till I once look ' d on you , For I fear ' d I might afterward lose you .
But as for me , for you , the irresistible sea is to separate us , As for an hour carrying us diverse , yet cannot carry us diverse forever ; Be not impatient -- a little space -- know you I salute the air , the ocean and the land , Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love .
} O Hymen !
O Hymenee !
O why sting me for a swift moment only ?
} I Heard You Solemn - Sweet Pipes of the Organ
Scented herbage of my breast , Leaves from you I glean , I write , to be perused best afterwards , Tomb - leaves , body - leaves growing up above me above death , Perennial roots , tall leaves , O the winter shall not freeze you delicate leaves , Every year shall you bloom again , out from where you retired you shall emerge again ; O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale your faint odor , but I believe a few will ; O slender leaves !
I permit you to tell in your own way of the heart that is under you , O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves , you are not happiness , You are often more bitter than I can bear , you burn and sting me , Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots , you make me think of death , Death is beautiful from you , ( what indeed is finally beautiful except death and love ?)
grow up out of my breast !
Who is he that would become my follower ?
Or else by stealth in some wood for trial , Or back of a rock in the open air , ( For in any roof ' d room of a house I emerge not , nor in company , And in libraries I lie as one dumb , a gawk , or unborn , or dead ,) But just possibly with you on a high hill , first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares , Or possibly with you sailing at sea , or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island , Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you , With the comrade ' s long - dwelling kiss or the new husband ' s kiss , For I am the new husband and I am the comrade .
Not heaving from my ribb ' d breast only , Not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself , Not in those long - drawn , ill - supprest sighs , Not in many an oath and promise broken , Not in my wilful and savage soul ' s volition , Not in the subtle nourishment of the air , Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists , Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease , Not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only , Not in cries , laughter , defiancies , thrown from me when alone far in the wilds , Not in husky pantings through clinch ' d teeth , Not in sounded and resounded words , chattering words , echoes , dead words , Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep , Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day , Nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss you continually -- not there , Not in any or all of them O adhesiveness !
} The Base of All Metaphysics
When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv ' d with plaudits in the capitol , still it was not a happy night for me that follow ' d , And else when I carous ' d , or when my plans were accomplish ' d , still I was not happy , But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health , refresh ' d , singing , inhaling the ripe breath of autumn , When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light , When I wander ' d alone over the beach , and undressing bathed , laughing with the cool waters , and saw the sun rise , And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming , O then I was happy , O then each breath tasted sweeter , and all that day my food nourish ' d me more , and the beautiful day pass ' d well , And the next came with equal joy , and with the next at evening came my friend , And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores , I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me , For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night , In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me , And his arm lay lightly around my breast -- and that night I was happy .
To begin with take warning , I am surely far different from what you suppose ; Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal ?
Do you see no further than this facade , this smooth and tolerant manner of me ?
Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya , illusion ?
Roots and leaves themselves alone are these , Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pond - side , Breast - sorrel and pinks of love , fingers that wind around tighter than vines , Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the sun is risen , Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living sea , to you O sailors !
Frost - mellow ' d berries and Third - month twigs offer ' d fresh to young persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up , Love - buds put before you and within you whoever you are , Buds to be unfolded on the old terms , If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bring form , color , perfume , to you , If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers , fruits , tall branches and trees .
} City of Orgies
City of orgies , walks and joys , City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make Not the pageants of you , not your shifting tableaus , your spectacles , repay me , Not the interminable rows of your houses , nor the ships at the wharves , Nor the processions in the streets , nor the bright windows with goods in them , Nor to converse with learn ' d persons , or bear my share in the soiree or feast ; Not those , but as I pass O Manhattan , your frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me love , Offering response to my own -- these repay me , Lovers , continual lovers , only repay me .
} This Moment Yearning and Thoughtful
} When I Persue the Conquer ' d Fame
} Here the Frailest Leaves of Me
A glimpse through an interstice caught , Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar - room around the stove late of a winter night , and I unremark ' d seated in a corner , Of a youth who loves me and whom I love , silently approaching and seating himself near , that he may hold me by the hand , A long while amid the noises of coming and going , of drinking and oath and smutty jest , There we two , content , happy in being together , speaking little , perhaps not a word .
You on the Mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of the Mississippi !

} Sometimes with One I Love
Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse unreturn ' d love , But now I think there is no unreturn ' d love , the pay is certain one way or another , ( I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return ' d , Yet out of that I have written these songs .)
O woman I love !
That shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood , chattering , chaffering , How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits , How often I question and doubt whether that is really me ; But among my lovers and caroling these songs , O I never doubt whether that is really me .
Such join ' d unended links , each hook ' d to the next , Each answering all , each sharing the earth with all .
Who are the infants , some playing , some slumbering ?
Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about each other ' s necks ?
What rivers are these ?
What myriads of dwellings are they fill ' d with dwellers ?
Who are they you salute , and that one after another salute you ?
I behold the mariners of the world , Some are in storms , some in the night with the watch on the lookout , Some drifting helplessly , some with contagious diseases .
I see the nameless masonries , venerable messages of the unknown events , heroes , records of the earth .
I see all the menials of the earth , laboring , I see all the prisoners in the prisons , I see the defective human bodies of the earth , The blind , the deaf and dumb , idiots , hunchbacks , lunatics , The pirates , thieves , betrayers , murderers , slave - makers of the earth , The helpless infants , and the helpless old men and women .

I will be honest with you , I do not offer the old smooth prizes , but offer rough new prizes , These are the days that must happen to you : You shall not heap up what is call ' d riches , You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve , You but arrive at the city to which you were destin ' d , you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call ' d by an irresistible call to depart , You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you , What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with passionate kisses of parting , You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach ' d hands toward you .

All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems , The words of true poems do not merely please , The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty ; The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and fathers , The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science .

O the joy of my spirit -- it is uncaged -- it darts like lightning !
The saddle , the gallop , the pressure upon the seat , the cool gurgling by the ears and hair .
( O something pernicious and dread !
O to resume the joys of the soldier !
To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work , To plough land in the fall for winter - sown crops , To plough land in the spring for maize , To train orchards , to graft the trees , to gather apples in the fall .
The plenteousness of all , that there are no bounds , To emerge and be of the sky , of the sun and moon and flying clouds , as one with them .
Joy of the glad light - beaming day , joy of the wide - breath ' d games ?
O to attract by more than attraction !
How it is I know not -- yet behold !
To leave this steady unendurable land , To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets , the sidewalks and the houses , To leave you O you solid motionless land , and entering a ship , To sail and sail and sail !
Strong shapes and attributes of strong shapes , masculine trades , sights and sounds .
What invigorates life invigorates death , And the dead advance as much as the living advance , And the future is no more uncertain than the present , For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as the delicatesse of the earth and of man , And nothing endures but personal qualities .
Or a teeming manufacturing state ?

Than this nothing has better served , it has served all , Served the fluent - tongued and subtle - sensed Greek , and long ere the Greek , Served in building the buildings that last longer than any , Served the Hebrew , the Persian , the most ancient Hindustanee , Served the mound - raiser on the Mississippi , served those whose relics remain in Central America , Served Albic temples in woods or on plains , with unhewn pillars and the druids , Served the artificial clefts , vast , high , silent , on the snow - cover ' d hills of Scandinavia , Served those who time out of mind made on the granite walls rough sketches of the sun , moon , stars , ships , ocean waves , Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths , served the pastoral tribes and nomads , Served the long distant Kelt , served the hardy pirates of the Baltic , Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of Ethiopia , Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the making of those for war , Served all great works on land and all great works on the sea , For the mediaeval ages and before the mediaeval ages , Served not the living only then as now , but served the dead .

Away with old romance !
Away with novels , plots and plays of foreign courts , Away with love - verses sugar ' d in rhyme , the intrigues , amours of idlers , Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late music slide , The unhealthy pleasures , extravagant dissipations of the few , With perfumes , heat and wine , beneath the dazzling chandeliers .
I say I bring thee Muse to - day and here , All occupations , duties broad and close , Toil , healthy toil and sweat , endless , without cessation , The old , old practical burdens , interests , joys , The family , parentage , childhood , husband and wife , The house - comforts , the house itself and all its belongings , Food and its preservation , chemistry applied to it , Whatever forms the average , strong , complete , sweet - blooded man or woman , the perfect longeve personality , And helps its present life to health and happiness , and shapes its soul , For the eternal real life to come .

1 A California song , A prophecy and indirection , a thought impalpable to breathe as air , A chorus of dryads , fading , departing , or hamadryads departing , A murmuring , fateful , giant voice , out of the earth and sky , Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense .
The choppers heard not , the camp shanties echoed not , The quick - ear ' d teamsters and chain and jack - screw men heard not , As the wood - spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to join the refrain , But in my soul I plainly heard .
In them these skies and airs , these mountain peaks , Shasta , Nevadas , These huge precipitous cliffs , this amplitude , these valleys , far Yosemite , To be in them absorb ' d , assimilated .

or the lines of the arches and cornices ?)
Does all sit there with you , with the mystic unseen soul ?
6 Will you seek afar off ?
you surely come back at last , In things best known to you finding the best , or as good as the best , In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest , strongest , lovingest , Happiness , knowledge , not in another place but this place , not for another hour but this hour , Man in the first you see or touch , always in friend , brother , nighest neighbor -- woman in mother , sister , wife , The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems or anywhere , You workwomen and workmen of these States having your own divine and strong life , And all else giving place to men and women like you .

Embracing man , embracing all , proceed the three hundred and sixty - five resistlessly round the sun ; Embracing all , soothing , supporting , follow close three hundred and sixty - five offsets of the first , sure and necessary as they .
Tumbling on steadily , nothing dreading , Sunshine , storm , cold , heat , forever withstanding , passing , carrying , The soul ' s realization and determination still inheriting , The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing , No balk retarding , no anchor anchoring , on no rock striking , Swift , glad , content , unbereav ' d , nothing losing , Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account , The divine ship sails the divine sea .
Say on , sayers !
Work on , age after age , nothing is to be lost , It may have to wait long , but it will certainly come in use , When the materials are all prepared and ready , the architects shall appear .
Day full - blown and splendid - day of the immense sun , action , ambition , laughter , The Night follows close with millions of suns , and sleep and restoring darkness .
the soul , above all science , For it has history gather ' d like husks around the globe , For it the entire star - myriads roll through the sky .
In spiral routes by long detours , ( As a much - tacking ship upon the sea ,) For it the partial to the permanent flowing , For it the real to the ideal tends .
4 And thou America , For the scheme ' s culmination , its thought and its reality , For these ( not for thyself ) thou hast arrived .

I do not know whether others behold what I behold , In the procession along with the nobles of Niphon , the errand - bearers , Bringing up the rear , hovering above , around , or in the ranks marching , But I will sing you a song of what I behold Libertad .
When million - footed Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements , When the thunder - cracking guns arouse me with the proud roar love , When the round - mouth ' d guns out of the smoke and smell I love spit their salutes , When the fire - flashing guns have fully alerted me , and heaven - clouds canopy my city with a delicate thin haze , When gorgeous the countless straight stems , the forests at the wharves , thicken with colors , When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak , When pennants trail and street - festoons hang from the windows , When Broadway is entirely given up to foot - passengers and foot - standers , when the mass is densest , When the facades of the houses are alive with people , when eyes gaze riveted tens of thousands at a time , When the guests from the islands advance , when the pageant moves forward visible , When the summons is made , when the answer that waited thousands of years answers , I too arising , answering , descend to the pavements , merge with the crowd , and gaze with them .

} Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking
Yes my brother I know , The rest might not , but I have treasur ' d every note , For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding , Silent , avoiding the moonbeams , blending myself with the shadows , Recalling now the obscure shapes , the echoes , the sounds and sights after their sorts , The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing , I , with bare feet , a child , the wind wafting my hair , Listen ' d long and long .
Listen ' d to keep , to sing , now translating the notes , Following you my brother .
O night !
do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers ?
High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves , Surely you must know who is here , is here , You must know who I am , my love .
What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow ?
O rising stars !
Pierce the woods , the earth , Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want .
Shake out carols !
But soft !

O I am very sick and sorrowful
O throat !
O happy life !

I mean tenderly by you and all , I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead , and following me and mine .

Ship of the body , ship of the soul , voyaging , voyaging , voyaging .
Weep not , child , Weep not , my darling , With these kisses let me remove your tears , The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious , They shall not long possess the sky , they devour the stars only in apparition , Jupiter shall emerge , be patient , watch again another night , the Pleiades shall emerge , They are immortal , all those stars both silvery and golden shall shine out again , The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again , they endure , The vast immortal suns and the long - enduring pensive moons shall again shine .

} Song for All Seas , All Ships
Of sea - captains young or old , and the mates , and of all intrepid sailors , Of the few , very choice , taciturn , whom fate can never surprise nor death dismay .
Wild , wild the storm , and the sea high running , Steady the roar of the gale , with incessant undertone muttering , Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing , Waves , air , midnight , their savagest trinity lashing , Out in the shadows there milk - white combs careering , On beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting , Where through the murk the easterly death - wind breasting , Through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing , ( That in the distance !
A fog follows , antiques of the same come limping , Some appear wooden - legged , and some appear bandaged and bloodless .
Why this is indeed a show -- it has called the dead out of the earth !
Cock ' d hats of mothy mould -- crutches made of mist !
Does the ague convulse your limbs ?
do you mistake your crutches for firelocks and level them ?
Worse and worse -- can ' t you stand it ?
But there is one thing that belongs here -- shall I tell you what it is , gentlemen of Boston ?

Over the traffic of cities -- over the rumble of wheels in the streets ; Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses ?
no sleepers must sleep in those beds , No bargainers ' bargains by day -- no brokers or speculators -- would they continue ?
Would the talkers be talking ?
Then rattle quicker , heavier drums -- you bugles wilder blow .
Words !
Words no more , for hearken and see , My song is there in the open air , and I must sing , With the banner and pennant a - flapping .
Pennant : Come up here , bard , bard , Come up here , soul , soul , Come up here , dear little child , To fly in the clouds and winds with me , and play with the measureless light .
How envied by all the earth .
Poet : Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high , On floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels , On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward land , The great steady wind from west or west - by - south , Floating so buoyant with milk - white foam on the waters .
But I am not the sea nor the red sun , I am not the wind with girlish laughter , Not the immense wind which strengthens , not the wind which lashes , Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death , But I am that which unseen comes and sings , sings , sings , Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land , Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings , And the shore - sands know and the hissing wave , and that banner and pennant , Aloft there flapping and flapping .
With passions of demons , slaughter , premature death ?
Not houses of peace indeed are you , nor any nor all their prosperity , ( if need be , you shall again have every one of those houses to destroy them , You thought not to destroy those valuable houses , standing fast , full of comfort , built with money , May they stand fast , then ?
was the sea risen ?
( Yet a mournful wall and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark , In a lull of the deafening confusion .)
And do you rise higher than ever yet O days , O cities !
you have done me good , My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment , Long had I walk ' d my cities , my country roads through farms , only half satisfied , One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake , crawl ' d on the ground before me , Continually preceding my steps , turning upon me oft , ironically hissing low ; The cities I loved so well I abandon ' d and left , I sped to the certainties suitable to me , Hungering , hungering , hungering , for primal energies and Nature ' s dauntlessness , I refresh ' d myself with it only , I could relish it only , I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire -- on the water and air waited long ; But now I no longer wait , I am fully satisfied , I am glutted , I have witness ' d the true lightning , I have witness ' d my cities electric , I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise , Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds , No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea .
The noble son on sinewy feet advancing , I saw , out of the land of prairies , land of Ohio ' s waters and of Indiana , To the rescue the stalwart giant hurry his plenteous offspring , Drest in blue , bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders .
City of ships !
O the fierce ships !
O the beautiful sharp - bow ' d steam - ships and sail - ships !)
city of hurried and glittering tides !
Proud and passionate city -- mettlesome , mad , extravagant city !
Rest , while I tell what the crowd around us means , On the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising , There is the camp , one regiment departs to - morrow , Do you hear the officers giving their orders ?
hear what a clapping !
I tell not now the whole of the battle , But one brigade early in the forenoon order ' d forward to engage the red - coats , Of that brigade I tell , and how steadily it march ' d , And how long and well it stood confronting death .
Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing ?)
A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim , As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless , As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent , Three forms I see on stretchers lying , brought out there untended lying , Over each the blanket spread , ample brownish woolen blanket , Gray and heavy blanket , folding , covering all .
Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port , though beaten back and many times baffled ; Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long , By deserts parch ' d , snows chill ' d , rivers wet , perseveres till he reaches his destination , More than I have charged myself , heeded or unheeded , to compose march for these States , For a battle - call , rousing to arms if need be , years , centuries hence .
of curious panics , Of hard - fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains ?
I never knew you , Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you , if that would save you .
In mercy come quickly .)
4 Thus in silence in dreams ' projections , Returning , resuming , I thread my way through the hospitals , The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand , I sit by the restless all the dark night , some are so young , Some suffer so much , I recall the experience sweet and sad , ( Many a soldier ' s loving arms about this neck have cross ' d and rested , Many a soldier ' s kiss dwells on these bearded lips .)
( The soldiers in companies or regiments -- some starting away , flush ' d and reckless , Some , their time up , returning with thinn ' d ranks , young , yet very old , worn , marching , noticing nothing ;) Give me the shores and wharves heavy - fringed with black ships !
Lo , the moon ascending , Up from the east the silvery round moon , Beautiful over the house - tops , ghastly , phantom moon , Immense and silent moon .
O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me !
No danger shall balk Columbia ' s lovers , If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one .
One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian ' s comrade , From Maine and from hot Carolina , and another an Oregonese , shall be friends triune , More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth .

Lo , Victress on the peaks , Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world , ( The world O Libertad , that vainly conspired against thee ,) Out of its countless beleaguering toils , after thwarting them all , Dominant , with the dazzling sun around thee , Flauntest now unharm ' d in immortal soundness and bloom -- lo , in these hours supreme , No poem proud , I chanting bring to thee , nor mastery ' s rapturous verse , But a cluster containing night ' s darkness and blood - dripping wounds , And psalms of the dead .
} Spirit Whose Work Is Done [ Washington City , 1865 ]
Spirit whose work is done -- spirit of dreadful hours !
Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets ; Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts , ( yet onward ever unfaltering pressing ,) Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene -- electric spirit , That with muttering voice through the war now closed , like a tireless phantom flitted , Rousing the land with breath of flame , while you beat and beat the drum , Now as the sound of the drum , hollow and harsh to the last , reverberates round me , As your ranks , your immortal ranks , return , return from the battles , As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders , As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders , As those slanted bayonets , whole forests of them appearing in the distance , approach and pass on , returning homeward , Moving with steady motion , swaying to and fro to the right and left , Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time ; Spirit of hours I knew , all hectic red one day , but pale as death next day , Touch my mouth ere you depart , press my lips close , Leave me your pulses of rage -- bequeath them to me -- fill me with currents convulsive , Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone , Let them identify you to the future in these songs .
} To the Leaven ' d Soil They Trod
To the leaven ' d soil they trod calling I sing for the last , ( Forth from my tent emerging for good , loosing , untying the tent - ropes ,) In the freshness the forenoon air , in the far - stretching circuits and vistas again to peace restored , To the fiery fields emanative and the endless vistas beyond , to the South and the North , To the leaven ' d soil of the general Western world to attest my songs , To the Alleghanian hills and the tireless Mississippi , To the rocks I calling sing , and all the trees in the woods , To the plains of the poems of heroes , to the prairies spreading wide , To the far - off sea and the unseen winds , and the sane impalpable air ; And responding they answer all , ( but not in words ,) The average earth , the witness of war and peace , acknowledges mutely , The prairie draws me close , as the father to bosom broad the son , The Northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the end , But the hot sun of the South is to fully ripen my songs .
MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN ]
9 Sing on there in the swamp , O singer bashful and tender , I hear your notes , I hear your call , I hear , I come presently , I understand you , But a moment I linger , for the lustrous star has detain ' d me , The star my departing comrade holds and detains me .
13 Sing on , sing on you gray - brown bird , Sing from the swamps , the recesses , pour your chant from the bushes , Limitless out of the dusk , out of the cedars and pines .
O liquid and free and tender !
And the singer so shy to the rest receiv ' d me , The gray - brown bird I know receiv ' d us comrades three , And he sang the carol of death , and a verse for him I love .
Prais ' d be the fathomless universe , For life and joy , and for objects and knowledge curious , And for love , sweet love -- but praise !
praise !
Over the tree - tops I float thee a song , Over the rising and sinking waves , over the myriad fields and the prairies wide , Over the dense - pack ' d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways , I float this carol with joy , with joy to thee O death .
While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed , As to long panoramas of visions .
my Captain !
heart !
O the bleeding drops of red , Where on the deck my Captain lies , Fallen cold and dead .
My Captain does not answer , his lips are pale and still , My father does not feel my arm , he has no pulse nor will , The ship is anchor ' d safe and sound , its voyage closed and done , From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won ; Exult O shores , and ring O bells !

} This Dust Was Once the Man
This dust was once the man , Gentle , plain , just and resolute , under whose cautious hand , Against the foulest crime in history known in any land or age , Was saved the Union of these States .
2 A Nation announcing itself , I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated , I reject none , accept all , then reproduce all in my own forms .

Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world !
10 Of these States the poet is the equable man , Not in him but off from him things are grotesque , eccentric , fail of their full returns , Nothing out of its place is good , nothing in its place is bad , He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion , neither more nor less , He is the arbiter of the diverse , he is the key , He is the equalizer of his age and land , He supplies what wants supplying , he checks what wants checking , In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace , large , rich , thrifty , building populous towns , encouraging agriculture , arts , commerce , lighting the study of man , the soul , health , immortality , government , In war he is the best backer of the war , he fetches artillery as good as the engineer ' s , he can make every word he speaks draw blood , The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith , He is no arguer , he is judgment , ( Nature accepts him absolutely ,) He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun failing round helpless thing , As he sees the farthest he has the most faith , His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things , In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent , He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement , He sees eternity in men and women , he does not see men and women as dreams or dots .
For the great Idea , the idea of perfect and free individuals , For that , the bard walks in advance , leader of leaders , The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots .
Songs of stern defiance ever ready , Songs of the rapid arming and the march , The flag of peace quick - folded , and instead the flag we know , Warlike flag of the great Idea .
Have you possess ' d yourself of the Federal Constitution ?
Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them , and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy ?

Is it not something that has been better told or done before ?
Does it answer universal needs ?
Will it absorb into me as I absorb food , air , to appear again in my strength , gait , face ?
What does it mean to American persons , progresses , cities ?
after death you shall be superb , Justice , health , self - esteem , clear the way with irresistible power ; How dare you place any thing before a man ?
Underneath all , individuals , I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals , The American compact is altogether with individuals , The only government is that which makes minute of individuals , The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single individual -- namely to You .
( Mother !
Underneath the lessons of things , spirits , Nature , governments , ownerships , I swear I perceive other lessons , Underneath all to me is myself , to you yourself , ( the same monotonous old song .)
I am for those that have never been master ' d , For men and women whose tempers have never been master ' d , For those whom laws , theories , conventions , can never master .
I will not be outfaced by irrational things , I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me , I will make cities and civilizations defer to me , This is what I have learnt from America -- it is the amount , and it I teach again .
I know now why the earth is gross , tantalizing , wicked , it is for my sake , I take you specially to be mine , you terrible , rude forms .

Pass -- then rattle drums again , For an army heaves in sight , O another gathering army , Swarming , trailing on the rear , O you dread accruing army , O you regiments so piteous , with your mortal diarrhoea , with your fever , O my land ' s maim ' d darlings , with the plenteous bloody bandage and the crutch , Lo , your pallid army follows .)
Melt , melt away ye armies -- disperse ye blue - clad soldiers , Resolve ye back again , give up for good your deadly arms , Other the arms the fields henceforth for you , or South or North , With saner wars , sweet wars , life - giving wars .
Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All , With dilated form and lambent eyes watch ' d you .
Well - pleased America thou beholdest , Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters , The human - divine inventions , the labor - saving implements ; Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the revolving hay - rakes , The steam - power reaping - machines and the horse - power machines The engines , thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain , well separating the straw , the nimble work of the patent pitchfork , Beholdest the newer saw - mill , the southern cotton - gin , and the rice - cleanser .
Beneath thy look O Maternal , With these and else and with their own strong hands the heroes harvest .
The streets themselves and the facades of houses , and goods in the windows , Vehicles , teams , the heavy - plank ' d wharves , the huge crossing at the ferries , The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset , the river between , Shadows , aureola and mist , the light falling on roofs and gables of white or brown two miles off , The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide , the little boat slack - tow ' d astern , The hurrying tumbling waves , quick - broken crests , slapping , The strata of color ' d clouds , the long bar of maroon - tint away solitary by itself , the spread of purity it lies motionless in , The horizon ' s edge , the flying sea - crow , the fragrance of salt marsh and shore mud , These became part of that child who went forth every day , and who now goes , and will always go forth every day .
The grass of spring covers the prairies , The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden , The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward , The apple - buds cluster together on the apple - branches , The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves , The tinge awakes over the willow - tree and the mulberry - tree , The he - birds carol mornings and evenings while the she - birds sit on their nests , The young of poultry break through the hatch ' d eggs , The new - born of animals appear , the calf is dropt from the cow , the colt from the mare , Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato ' s dark green leaves , Out of its hill rises the yellow maize - stalk , the lilacs bloom in the dooryards , The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour dead .
Then courage European revolter , revoltress !
Afar they stand , yet near to me they stand , Some with oval countenances learn ' d and calm , Some naked and savage , some like huge collections of insects , Some in tents , herdsmen , patriarchs , tribes , horsemen , Some prowling through woods , some living peaceably on farms , laboring , reaping , filling barns , Some traversing paved avenues , amid temples , palaces , factories , libraries , shows , courts , theatres , wonderful monuments .
I believe of all those men and women that fill ' d the unnamed lands , every one exists this hour here or elsewhere , invisible to us .
In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life , and out of what he or she did , felt , became , loved , sinn ' d , in life .
Manhattan ' s streets I saunter ' d pondering , On Time , Space , Reality -- on such as these , and abreast with them Prudence .
The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence , Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that suits immortality .
The indirect is just as much as the direct , The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body , if not more .
The world does not so exist , no parts palpable or impalpable so exist , No consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation , and that from some other , Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the beginning than any .
Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time , space , reality , That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own .
O fearful thought -- a convict soul .
A soul confined by bars and bands , Cries , help !
and wrings her hands , Blinded her eyes , bleeding her breast , Nor pardon finds , nor balm of rest .
It was not I that sinn ' d the sin , The ruthless body dragg ' d me in ; Though long I strove courageously , The body was too much for me .

Warble me now for joy of lilac - time , ( returning in reminiscence ,) Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature ' s sake , souvenirs of earliest summer , Gather the welcome signs , ( as children with pebbles or stringing shells ,) Put in April and May , the hylas croaking in the ponds , the elastic air , Bees , butterflies , the sparrow with its simple notes , Blue - bird and darting swallow , nor forget the high - hole flashing his golden wings , The tranquil sunny haze , the clinging smoke , the vapor , Shimmer of waters with fish in them , the cerulean above , All that is jocund and sparkling , the brooks running , The maple woods , the crisp February days and the sugar - making , The robin where he hops , bright - eyed , brown - breasted , With musical clear call at sunrise , and again at sunset , Or flitting among the trees of the apple - orchard , building the nest of his mate , The melted snow of March , the willow sending forth its yellow - green sprouts , For spring - time is here !

Inside these breast - bones I lie smutch ' d and choked , Beneath this face that appears so impassive hell ' s tides continually run , Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me , I walk with delinquents with passionate love , I feel I am of them -- I belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself , And henceforth I will not deny them -- for how can I deny myself ?
All must have reference to the ensemble of the world , and the compact truth of the world , There shall be no subject too pronounced -- all works shall illustrate the divine law of indirections .

I am she who adorn ' d herself and folded her hair expectantly , My truant lover has come , and it is dark .

Peace is always beautiful , The myth of heaven indicates peace and night .
The myth of heaven indicates the soul , The soul is always beautiful , it appears more or it appears less , it comes or it lags behind , It comes from its embower ' d garden and looks pleasantly on itself and encloses the world , Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting , and perfect and clean the womb cohering , The head well - grown proportion ' d and plumb , and the bowels and joints proportion ' d and plumb .

Softly I lay my right hand upon you , you ' ust feel it , I do not argue , I bend my head close and half envelop it , I sit quietly by , I remain faithful , I am more than nurse , more than parent or neighbor , I absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily , that is eternal , you yourself will surely escape , The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious .

This face is an epilepsy , its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry , Its veins down the neck distend , its eyes roll till they show nothing but their whites , Its teeth grit , the palms of the hands are cut by the turn ' d - in nails , The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground , while he speculates well .
This face is bitten by vermin and worms , And this is some murderer ' s knife with a half - pull ' d scabbard .
4 The Lord advances , and yet advances , Always the shadow in front , always the reach ' d hand bringing up the laggards .
Out of this face emerge banners and horses -- O superb !
These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake , They show their descent from the Master himself .
She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse , The sun just shines on her old white head .
} The Mystic Trumpeter
and for my sensuous eyes , Bring the old pageants , show the feudal world .
What charm thy music works !
O how the immortal phantoms crowd around me !
6 Blow again trumpeter -- conjure war ' s alarums .
Swift to thy spell a shuddering hum like distant thunder rolls , Lo , where the arm ' d men hasten -- lo , mid the clouds of dust the glint of bayonets , I see the grime - faced cannoneers , I mark the rosy flash amid the smoke , I hear the cracking of the guns ; Nor war alone -- thy fearful music - song , wild player , brings every sight of fear , The deeds of ruthless brigands , rapine , murder -- I hear the cries for help !
7 O trumpeter , methinks I am myself the instrument thou playest , Thou melt ' st my heart , my brain -- thou movest , drawest , changest them at will ; And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me , Thou takest away all cheering light , all hope , I see the enslaved , the overthrown , the hurt , the opprest of the whole earth , I feel the measureless shame and humiliation of my race , it becomes all mine , Mine too the revenges of humanity , the wrongs of ages , baffled feuds and hatreds , Utter defeat upon me weighs -- all lost -- the foe victorious , ( Yet ' mid the ruins Pride colossal stands unshaken to the last , Endurance , resolution to the last .)
A reborn race appears -- a perfect world , all joy !
Women and men in wisdom innocence and health -- all joy !
joy !
Enough to merely be !
all over joy !
O glistening perfumed South !
my South !
good and evil !
O dear to me my birth - things -- all moving things and the trees where I was born -- the grains , plants , rivers , Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow , distant , over flats of slivery sands or through swamps , Dear to me the Roanoke , the Savannah , the Altamahaw , the Pedee , the Tombigbee , the Santee , the Coosa and the Sabine , O pensive , far away wandering , I return with my soul to haunt their banks again , Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes , I float on the Okeechobee , I cross the hummock - land or through pleasant openings or dense forests , I see the parrots in the woods , I see the papaw - tree and the blossoming titi ; Again , sailing in my coaster on deck , I coast off Georgia , I coast up the Carolinas , I see where the live - oak is growing , I see where the yellow - pine , the scented bay - tree , the lemon and orange , the cypress , the graceful palmetto , I pass rude sea - headlands and enter Pamlico sound through an inlet , and dart my vision inland ; O the cotton plant !
O tender and fierce pangs , I can stand them not , I will depart ; O to be a Virginian where I grew up !
I was asking for something specific and perfect for my city , Whereupon lo !
upsprang the aboriginal name .
City nested in bays !
In looks of fair unconscious babes , Or strangely in the coffin ' d dead , Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night , As some dissolving delicate film of dreams , Hiding yet lingering .
Two little breaths of words comprising it , Two words , yet all from first to last comprised in it .
How ardently for it !
for I would be more cautious , And who has been happiest ?
for I would be the boldest and truest being of the universe , And who benevolent ?
for I would show more benevolence than all the rest , And who has receiv ' d the love of the most friends ?
for I know what it is to receive the passionate love of many friends , And who possesses a perfect and enamour ' d body ?
for I would surround those thoughts , And who has made hymns fit for the earth ?
} Thoughts
} Weave in , My Hardy Life
By broad Potomac ' s shore , again old tongue , ( Still uttering , still ejaculating , canst never cease this babble ?)
Lave subtly with your waters every line Potomac !
Long have they pass ' d , faces and trenches and fields , Where through the carnage I moved with a callous composure , or away from the fallen , Onward I sped at the time -- but now of their forms at night , I dream , I dream , I dream .
I see the ships , ( they will last a few years ,) The vast factories with their foremen and workmen , And hear the indorsement of all , and do not object to it .
This is thy hour O Soul , thy free flight into the wordless , Away from books , away from art , the day erased , the lesson done , Thee fully forth emerging , silent , gazing , pondering the themes thou lovest best , Night , sleep , death and the stars .
As the time draws nigh glooming a cloud , A dread beyond of I know not what darkens me .
O book , O chants !
Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us ?
} Years of the Modern
Your horizon rises , I see it parting away for more august dramas , I see not America only , not only Liberty ' s nation but other nations preparing , I see tremendous entrances and exits , new combinations , the solidarity of races , I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world ' s stage , ( Have the old forces , the old wars , played their parts ?
Noiseless as mists and vapors , From their graves in the trenches ascending , From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee , From every point of the compass out of the countless graves , In wafted clouds , in myriads large , or squads of twos or threes or single ones they come , And silently gather round me .
My handsome tan - faced horsemen !
what life , what joy and pride , With all the perils were yours .)
Nor you drummers , neither at reveille at dawn , Nor the long roll alarming the camp , nor even the muffled beat for burial , Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums .
But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade , Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless , The slain elate and alive again , the dust and debris alive , I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers .
Perfume all -- make all wholesome , Make these ashes to nourish and blossom , O love , solve all , fructify all with the last chemistry .
( Surely there is something more in each of the trees , some living soul .)
O strain musical flowing through ages and continents , now reaching me and America !
I too carol the sun , usher ' d or at noon , or as now , setting , I too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the growths of the earth , I too have felt the resistless call of myself .
} As at Thy Portals Also Death
Pensive on her dead gazing I heard the Mother of All , Desperate on the torn bodies , on the forms covering the battlefields gazing , ( As the last gun ceased , but the scent of the powder - smoke linger ' d ,) As she call ' d to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk ' d , Absorb them well O my earth , she cried , I charge you lose not my sons , lose not an atom , And you streams absorb them well , taking their dear blood , And you local spots , and you airs that swim above lightly impalpable , And all you essences of soil and growth , and you my rivers ' depths , And you mountain sides , and the woods where my dear children ' s blood trickling redden ' d , And you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future trees , My dead absorb or South or North -- my young men ' s bodies absorb , and their precious precious blood , Which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me many a year hence , In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass , centuries hence , In blowing airs from the fields back again give me my darlings , give my immortal heroes , Exhale me them centuries hence , breathe me their breath , let not an atom be lost , O years and graves !
Nor alone those camps of white , old comrades of the wars , When as order ' d forward , after a long march , Footsore and weary , soon as the light lessens we halt for the night , Some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack , dropping asleep in our tracks , Others pitching the little tents , and the fires lit up begin to sparkle , Outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark , And a word provided for countersign , careful for safety , Till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the drums , We rise up refresh ' d , the night and sleep pass ' d over , and resume our journey , Or proceed to battle .
is it too only halting awhile , Till night and sleep pass over ?)
} So Long !
And take the young woman ' s hand and the young man ' s hand for the last time .
I announce a life that shall be copious , vehement , spiritual , bold , I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its translation .
Hasten throat and sound your last , Salute me -- salute the days once more .
My songs cease , I abandon them , From behind the screen where I hid I advance personally solely to you .
SANDS AT SEVENTY ]
I stand as on some mighty eagle ' s beak , Eastward the sea absorbing , viewing , ( nothing but sea and sky ,) The tossing waves , the foam , the ships in the distance , The wild unrest , the snowy , curling caps -- that inbound urge and urge of waves , Seeking the shores forever .
Wilt stir the waters yet ?
Or leave me here as now , Dull , parrot - like and old , with crack ' d voice harping , screeching ?

}[ I ] The Pilot in the Mist
Steaming the northern rapids --( an old St . Lawrence reminiscence , A sudden memory - flash comes back , I know not why , Here waiting for the sunrise , gazing from this hill ;) Again ' tis just at morning -- a heavy haze contends with daybreak , Again the trembling , laboring vessel veers me -- I press through foam - dash ' d rocks that almost touch me , Again I mark where aft the small thin Indian helmsman Looms in the mist , with brow elate and governing hand .
You unseen force , centripetal , centrifugal , through space ' s spread , Rapport of sun , moon , earth , and all the constellations , What are the messages by you from distant stars to us ?
what Sirius '?
What central heart -- and you the pulse -- vivifies all ?
}[ V ] And Yet Not You Alone
Then last of all , caught from these shores , this hill , Of you O tides , the mystic human meaning : Only by law of you , your swell and ebb , enclosing me the same , The brain that shapes , the voice that chants this song .
If I should need to name , O Western World , your powerfulest scene and show , ' Twould not be you , Niagara -- nor you , ye limitless prairies -- nor your huge rifts of canyons , Colorado , Nor you , Yosemite -- nor Yellowstone , with all its spasmic geyser - loops ascending to the skies , appearing and disappearing , Nor Oregon ' s white cones -- nor Huron ' s belt of mighty lakes -- nor Mississippi ' s stream : -- This seething hemisphere ' s humanity , as now , I ' d name -- the still small voice vibrating -- America ' s choosing day , ( The heart of it not in the chosen -- the act itself the main , the quadriennial choosing ,) The stretch of North and South arous ' d -- sea - board and inland -- Texas to Maine -- the Prairie States -- Vermont , Virginia , California , The final ballot - shower from East to West -- the paradox and conflict , The countless snow - flakes falling --( a swordless conflict , Yet more than all Rome ' s wars of old , or modern Napoleon ' s :) the peaceful choice of all , Or good or ill humanity -- welcoming the darker odds , the dross : -- Foams and ferments the wine ?
} Of That Blithe Throat of Thine
Of that blithe throat of thine from arctic bleak and blank , I ' ll mind the lesson , solitary bird -- let me too welcome chilling drifts , E ' en the profoundest chill , as now -- a torpid pulse , a brain unnerv ' d , Old age land - lock ' d within its winter bay --( cold , cold , O cold !)
Small the theme of my Chant , yet the greatest -- namely , One ' s - Self -- a simple , separate person .
Nor cease at the theme of One ' s - Self .
And thus upon our journey , footing the road , and more than once , and link ' d together let us go .)
} True Conquerors
Old farmers , travelers , workmen ( no matter how crippled or bent ,) Old sailors , out of many a perilous voyage , storm and wreck , Old soldiers from campaigns , with all their wounds , defeats and scars ; Enough that they ' ve survived at all -- long life ' s unflinching ones !
The two old , simple problems ever intertwined , Close home , elusive , present , baffled , grappled .
By each successive age insoluble , pass ' d on , To ours to - day -- and we pass on the same .
} Soon Shall the Winter ' s Foil Be Here
} A Prairie Sunset
Not meagre , latent boughs alone , O songs !
To - day , with bending head and eyes , thou , too , Columbia , Less for the mighty crown laid low in sorrow -- less for the Emperor , Thy true condolence breathest , sendest out o ' er many a salt sea mile , Mourning a good old man -- a faithful shepherd , patriot .

Kosmos , Quicksand Years , or Thoughts , Thou Mother with thy Equal Brood ," and many , many more unspecified , From fibre heart of mine -- from throat and tongue --( My life ' s hot pulsing blood , The personal urge and form for me -- not merely paper , automatic type and ink ,) Each song of mine -- each utterance in the past -- having its long , long history , Of life or death , or soldier ' s wound , of country ' s loss or safety , ( O heaven !
Heave the anchor short !
We know not whence , ( was the answer ,) We only know that we drift here with the rest , That we linger ' d and lagg ' d -- but were wafted at last , and are now here , To make the passing shower ' s concluding drops .
The soothing sanity and blitheness of completion , The pomp and hurried contest - glare and rush are done ; Now triumph !
} To the Pending Year
( Have I fought out and done indeed the battle ?)
Nor for myself -- my own rebellious self in thee ?
Down , down , proud gorge !-- though choking thee ; Thy bearded throat and high - borne forehead to the gutter ; Crouch low thy neck to eleemosynary gifts .
I doubt it not -- then more , far more ; In each old song bequeath ' d -- in every noble page or text , ( Different -- something unreck ' d before -- some unsuspected author ,) In every object , mountain , tree , and star -- in every birth and life , As part of each -- evolv ' d from each -- meaning , behind the ostent , A mystic cipher waits infolded .
Law ' s , all Astronomy ' s last refinement ?
( Of many debts incalculable , Haply our New World ' s chieftest debt is to old poems .)
( Let the future care for itself , where it reveals its troubles , impedimentas , Ours , ours the present throe , the democratic aim , the acceptance and the faith ;) To thee to - day our reaching arm , our turning neck -- to thee from us the expectant eye , Thou cluster free !
} When the Full - Grown Poet Came
} Osceola
Although I come and unannounc ' d , in horror and in pang , In pouring flood and fire , and wholesale elemental crash , ( this voice so solemn , strange ,) I too a minister of Deity .
thou !
For I too have forgotten , ( Wrapt in these little potencies of progress , politics , culture , wealth , inventions , civilization ,) Have lost my recognition of your silent ever - swaying power , ye mighty , elemental throes , In which and upon which we float , and every one of us is buoy ' d .
For his o ' erarching and last lesson the greybeard sufi , In the fresh scent of the morning in the open air , On the slope of a teeming Persian rose - garden , Under an ancient chestnut - tree wide spreading its branches , Spoke to the young priests and students .
Would you know the dissatisfaction ?
" It is the central urge in every atom , ( Often unconscious , often evil , downfallen ,) To return to its divine source and origin , however distant , Latent the same in subject and in object , without one exception ."
} " The Rounded Catalogue Divine Complete "
Unseen buds , infinite , hidden well , Under the snow and ice , under the darkness , in every square or cubic inch , Germinal , exquisite , in delicate lace , microscopic , unborn , Like babes in wombs , latent , folded , compact , sleeping ; Billions of billions , and trillions of trillions of them waiting , ( On earth and in the sea -- the universe -- the stars there in the heavens ,) Urging slowly , surely forward , forming endless , And waiting ever more , forever more behind .
Now for my last -- let me look back a moment ; The slower fainter ticking of the clock is in me , Exit , nightfall , and soon the heart - thud stopping .
