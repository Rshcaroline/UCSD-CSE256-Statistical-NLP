The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .
Mr . Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her .
She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .
How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .
The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .
All looked up to them .
It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .
" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- We shall be always meeting !
Randalls is such a distance .
" The carriage !
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .
I wish you may not catch cold ."
" Dirty , sir !
Not a speck on them ."
" Well !
Who cried most ?"
poor Miss Taylor !
" Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !"
said Emma playfully .
" But , Mr . Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for ."
my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .
It is the greatest amusement in the world !
Mr . Weston certainly would never marry again .
You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said ."
If I had not promoted Mr . Weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .
You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."
Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .
A complete change of life became desirable .
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr . Weston ' s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together .
The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up .
He had been at the pains of consulting Mr . Perry , the apothecary , on the subject .
CHAPTER III
Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .
Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .
It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .
It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church .
A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .
Encouragement should be given .
It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .
A _small_ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ?
Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ' s being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required .
Two such she did not want .
Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth .
Harriet had no penetration .
But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place .
Not that she _wanted_ him to marry .
" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .
" Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?
He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can ."
One does not , you know , after a time .
But did you never see him ?
A young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity .
A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other .
" Only four - and - twenty .
That is too young to settle .
" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .
However , I do not mean to set up my opinion against your ' s -- and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife .
But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it ."
His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ' s inclination .
Mr . Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was .
Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ?
At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men .
I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr . Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .
Mr . Weston must be between forty and fifty ."
Her next beginning was ,
If he means any thing , it must be to please you .
She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable .
Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head .
Do you really think it a bad thing ?-- why so ?"
" You surprize me !
Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good .
" Mr . Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject .
She means it , I know ."
" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .
Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family .
At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen .
" You are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess .
" Thank you .
We will not despair , however .
I do not pretend to Emma ' s genius for foretelling and guessing .
She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned .
How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ?
I am much mistaken if Emma ' s doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life .-- They only give a little polish ."
" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .
you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ?
Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ?"
" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .
John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
I will keep my ill - humour to myself .
I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state , I assure you ."
" I have no doubt of it ."
She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ' s picture .
You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general .
Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs . Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ?"
I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet .
I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see .
We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .
It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square ;-- and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again .
It then occurred to her to employ him in reading .
She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable .
" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted ,"-- observed Mrs . Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover .--" The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes .
Exactly so indeed !"
The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold ."
" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer .
Look at the tree ."
" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear ."
" He was too good !-- she could not endure the thought !-- she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world ,"-- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances ,-- and a very few minutes settled the business .
" What a precious deposit !"
He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so ,' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal .
cried Harriet .
The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .
" What shall you do !
the letter had much better be all your own .
You will express yourself very properly , I am sure .
If she can hesitate as to ` Yes ,' she ought to say ` No ' directly .
" You could not have visited me !"
We will not be parted .
The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark .
She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs . Goddard ' s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days .
Mr . Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other .
" I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter .
Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman ."
I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may .
" Very serious !
Will that do ?
This happened the night before last .
" Pray , Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , " how do you know that Mr . Martin did not speak yesterday ?"
" And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong .
Mr . Martin is a very respectable young man , but I cannot admit him to be Harriet ' s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her .
exclaimed Mr . Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , " No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation .
Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you .
She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself .
At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .
Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of .
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr . Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society .-- The sphere in which she moves is much above his .-- It would be a degradation ."
" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer !"
She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- That she is a gentleman ' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ' s daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny .-- She is superior to Mr . Robert Martin ."
She had no sense of superiority then .
Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people .
" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too .
cried she playfully .
" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet .
Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high .
She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do .
cried Mr .
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .
" Depend upon it , Elton will not do .
He knows the value of a good income as well as any body .
Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .
He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .
" I am very much obliged to you ," said Emma , laughing again .
Harriet ' s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy .
Her views of improving her little friend ' s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow .
In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon .
Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity .
Mr . Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in .
He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own .
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
their luxury and ease .
But ah !
Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse .
Do help me .
And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ?
It was enough for her to feel .
I thought it must be so .
Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
This is a connexion which offers nothing but good .
" Dear Miss Woodhouse !"
Dear me , how clever !-- Could it really be meant for me ?"
Receive it on my judgment .
" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected .
" When Miss Smiths and Mr . Eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form .
His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week .
Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury .
And how beautiful we thought he looked !
If they are anxious to see you _happily_ married , here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it ;-- if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in , here it will be accomplished ; and if their only object is that you should , in the common phrase , be _well_ married , here is the comfortable fortune , the respectable establishment , the rise in the world which must satisfy them ."
The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind .
Trust to me ."
The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change .
But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection .
It will be giving him so much pleasure !
He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all !-- You must let me read it to him ."
Do not let us be too solemn on the business .
" Oh !
" Aye , that ' s very just , indeed , that ' s very properly said .
It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it .-- Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma ."
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink ' d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before .
" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does .
Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband ."
This was too true for contradiction .
" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .
I am sure she will be pleased with the children .
They are very fond of being at Hartfield , Harriet ."
" I dare say they are , sir .
Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father .
John , the second , is named after his father .
And he is a very clever boy , indeed .
They will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ?'
and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas .
It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."
His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr . Woodhouse ' s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield .
Your friend will not take it amiss I hope .
Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh .
Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr . Elton .
A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be .
-- Harriet ' s was --
--
" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least .
And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ."
so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow .
the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else .
" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .
There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder .
yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury .
Heaven forbid !
" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good .
The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr . Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther ,
Well , ( smiling ,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .
It must , if I were not here .
They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield .
To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her .
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr . Elton should close it .
It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room .
CHAPTER XI
It was no longer in Emma ' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures .
The coming of her sister ' s family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect -- that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers .
He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .
There he had not always the patience that could have been wished .
" Ah , my dear ," said he , " poor Miss Taylor -- It is a grievous business ."
Either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either Mr . Weston or Mrs . Weston , and generally both , either at Randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here .
I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force .
" Me , my love ," cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part .-- " Are you talking about me ?-- I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr . Weston , that excellent Mr . Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve .
I thought it very well done of him indeed .
There is something so shocking in a child ' s being taken away from his parents and natural home !
I never could comprehend how Mr . Weston could part with him .
Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr . Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass .
Mr . Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr . Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ' s first day .
As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree ."
" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike ."
" Yes -- a good deal _nearer_ ."
Little Emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt .
" A man cannot be more so ," was his short , full answer .
" My poor dear Isabella ," said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children --" How long it is , how terribly long since you were here !
Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr . Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ;-- and two basins only were ordered .
After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection ,
" Why , pretty well ; but not quite well .
" And Mrs . Perry and the children , how are they ?
He will be so pleased to see my little ones ."
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
" It is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken to --
But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."
my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season .
It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there !
cried Mr . John Knightley , hearing his own name .
Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?"
" That sweet , amiable Jane Fairfax !"
It does not bear talking of ."
" I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here ."
A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .
Emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out .
Why does he make it any business of his , to wonder at what I do ?-- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another ?-- I may be allowed , I hope , the use of my judgment as well as Mr .
.
.
The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps .
CHAPTER XIII
The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr . Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs . Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
Emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- " a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from Mrs . Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them ."
Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs . Goddard ' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject ,
" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
What a strange thing love is !
" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr . Elton .
It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment !-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people ' s not staying comfortably at home when they can !
If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .
" _My_ report from Mrs . Goddard ' s ," said she presently , " was not so pleasant as I had hoped --` Not better ' was _my_ answer ."
no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs . Goddard ' s door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse .
How very comfortable they make it ;-- impossible to feel cold with such precautions .
The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman ' s carriage perfectly complete .
It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter .-- Ha !
" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr . Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence .
At Christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather .
CHAPTER XIV
Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs . Weston ' s drawing - room ;-- Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr . John Knightley disperse his ill - humour .
Emma ' s project of forgetting Mr . Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her .
For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet ' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr . Elton ' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .
" He has been wanting to come to us ," continued Mr . Weston , " ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he cannot command his own time .
If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe ."
To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful .
" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .
In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr . Weston were less sanguine ."
" He ought to come ," said Emma .
" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do ," replied Mrs . Weston .
" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way .
" He may have a great deal of influence on some points ," continued Mrs . Weston , " and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us ."
He turned to Mrs . Weston to implore her assistance , " Would not she give him her support ?-- would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs . Goddard ' s till it were certain that Miss Smith ' s disorder had no infection ?
Emma saw Mrs . Weston ' s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose .
She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention .
She had not time to know how Mr . Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr . John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr . Woodhouse :
Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow ."
" I admired your resolution very much , sir ," said he , " in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon .
I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight ."
Mr . Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr . Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away .
To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ," said she ; " I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
I could change my shoes , you know , the moment I got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold ."
He had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend .
Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied ,
" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton .
and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend ,-- but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all ,-- he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer .
" Good Heaven !"
cried Mr . Elton , " what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed !-- Oh !
No , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character .
I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else .
No !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- I am sure you have seen and understood me ."
In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance .
He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody .
She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more .
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .
These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .
The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church .
Mr . Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr .
The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr . Elton to Mr . Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr . Elton ' s best compliments , " that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr . Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had Mr . Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them ."
Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded .
It did , however .-- Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr . Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .
Mr . Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude .
She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ' s return .
Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own .
The affection of such a man as Mr . Elton would have been too great a distinction .-- She never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible .
If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .
Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society .
They must encounter each other , and make the best of it .
Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; Mr . Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .
The acquaintance at present had no charm for her .
It is impossible ."
" Yes , sometimes he can ."
" And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure ."
Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be .
" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .
I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow .'
-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going ."
" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it .
They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims .
Respect for right conduct is felt by every body .
As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority .
He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father .
Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now ."
I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not .
" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it .
Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ?
He may be very ` aimable ,' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."
" Me !-- not at all ," replied Mr . Knightley , rather displeased ; " I do not want to think ill of him .
" You will excuse my being so much over - powered .
" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable .
To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him ."
Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma ' s opinion , had been talking enough of Mr . Elton for that day .
Mrs . and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr . Woodhouse ' s health , cheerful communications about her mother ' s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet --" Mrs . Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too ."
She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr . Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .
" Oh !
Whenever she is with us , Mrs . Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
` Have you , upon your honour ?'
Emma ' s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest --
I was reading it to Mrs . Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
" Thank you .
Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she cannot say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days .
At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,
" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs . Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."
There is no comparison between them .
I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that .
CHAPTER II
The marriage of Lieut .
By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .
It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ' s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time .
She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education .
Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished .
In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved .
It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished .
There probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; Mr . Dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds .
" Was he handsome ?"
--" She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."
She believed every body found his manners pleasing ."
" Oh !
Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax ."
and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon -- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so , my dear ?"
" Emma ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " I have a piece of news for you .
yes , I always like news .
But , Mr . Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ?
My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her ."
When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr . Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind ."
Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf .
Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel .
I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours .-- My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --"
" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her ," said Emma , " nothing I suppose can be known .
How does Miss Smith do ?
I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative ."
Mr . Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ?"
I told you he was plain ."
Thank you , we do indeed .
As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .
dear ; I was so miserable !
I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there .-- Oh !
dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another .
dear , I thought it would have been the death of me !
They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet ' s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of Harriet ' s description ?-- So easily pleased -- so little discerning ;-- what signified her praise ?
Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy .
Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting .
A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins ' s name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr . Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
He had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost .
On that article , truth seemed attainable .
Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived .
That was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins .
Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .
And now , poor girl !
She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr . Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her .
While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit .
She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of Harriet ?
She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating .
In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends .
There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window .
It was a bad business .
Mr . Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated .
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .
" Four o ' clock !-- depend upon it he will be here by three ," was Mr . Weston ' s quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting .
She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr . Weston and his son .
The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _very_ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father ' s ; he looked quick and sensible .
I remembered what I used to do myself .
Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed .
That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma ' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled .
He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment .
He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else .
" His father ' s marriage ," he said , " had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him ."
He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse ' s character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor ' s .
Weston ."
His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying ,
Do you know any family of that name ?"
Call upon her , by all means ."
" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ," said she , " I think you will to - day .
She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life .
" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street ."
Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort .
They walked thither directly .
And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning .
They were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury .
Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings .
He saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested .
It was but an effusion of lively spirits .
Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour .
He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health .
They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of " Men ' s Beavers " and " York Tan " were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --" But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ .
" May I , indeed ?-- Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well .
" Yes --( rather hesitatingly )-- I believe I do ."
Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax ' s situation in life .
He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment .
" Yes , Mr . Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof ."
" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
" Oh !
There is safety in reserve , but no attraction .
He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper ' s room , or a bad butler ' s pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment .
CHAPTER VII
He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .
This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .
This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr . Knightley , none of Mr . Weston .
had been a question of his .
Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs . Goddard , if not Mrs . Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- Mr . Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .
" I am not fond of dinner - visiting ," said he --" I never was .
The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to .
But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_ , was increasing , not lessening , Mr . Woodhouse ' s agitation .
Mr . Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged .
But you will do every thing right .
I know what worthy people they are .
CHAPTER VIII
He came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done .
If he were , he would have done this differently .
There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them .
" Nonsensical girl !"
was his reply , but not at all in anger .
The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr . Cox ' s family , the lawyer of Highbury .
That very dear part of Emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .
Mrs . Cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way , and still listen to Mrs . Cole .
and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr . Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with .-- I was saying this to Mr . Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening ."
" Me !-- I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell ' s being so rich and so liberal .-- It is a handsome present ."
" Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before ."
" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs . Bates ' s house ."
" I do not know .
I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question .
" Mrs . Dixon !
She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ' s scheme than an elderly man ' s .
One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland .
Did you ever hear of that ?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .
They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , Emma said ,
" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me .
Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr . and Mrs .
And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love ."
The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it .
Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr . Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend .
Mrs . Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine ' s countenance .
In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .
" He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete ."
Elton ."
_Now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish .
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole .
said she .
He started .
Shall I ?-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it ;-- whether she colours ."
He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing .
Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs . Weston .
Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ?"
" Oh !
I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr . Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage .
You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once .
" Very likely ," said Emma --" nothing more likely .
He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr . Knightley .
The more I think of it , the more probable it appears .
Knightley must not marry !-- You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell ?-- Oh !
I cannot at all consent to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know ."
He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention .
You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey !-- Oh !
For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing ."
" But Mr . Knightley does not want to marry .
He does not care about Jane Fairfax .
" For shame , Emma !
and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr . Knightley ?
Mr . Knightley does nothing mysteriously ."
" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma .
Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs . Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr . Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
Surprizes are foolish things .
" One more ;-- they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more ."
" Perhaps it is as well ," said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage .
" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s ."
She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half .
" They told me something ," said Harriet rather hesitatingly ;" but it is nothing of any consequence ."
He sat by her at dinner .
I was not aware of it myself .
I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now ."
She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same .
It need not detain us long .
" Should I send it to Mrs . Goddard ' s , ma ' am ?"
Ford .-- " Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s .
How do you do , Miss Smith ?-- Very well I thank you .-- And I begged Mrs . Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding ."
" I hope Mrs . Bates and Miss Fairfax are --"
" Very well , I am much obliged to you .
My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night .
How is Mr .
Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me .
I believe it is the only way that Mr . Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome .
We have apple - dumplings , however , very often .
Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in ."
" What was I talking of ?"
So very obliging of Mr . Frank Churchill !
said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively .'
.
.
And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh !'
He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them .
` I am sure you must be ,' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use .
Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring .
The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs . Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte .
" This is a pleasure ," said he , in rather a low voice , " coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated .
" What !"
said Mrs . Weston , " have not you finished it yet ?
This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come .
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
Do not you think so ?"
I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs . Bates ,) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present ."
Do you know it ?-- Cramer .-- And here are a new set of Irish melodies .
True affection only could have prompted it ."
Emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her .-- This amiable , upright , perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings .
" I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me .
" She is not entirely without it , I think ."
I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here .
We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us .
So began Miss Bates ; and Mr . Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say ,
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."
I could not stay two minutes .
Mr . Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant .-- Did you ever see such dancing ?-- Was not it delightful ?-- Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it ."
" To think of your sending us all your store apples .
But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .
He asked me if he could do any thing .
" Yes ," said Jane , " we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing ."
It will not do to _invite_ five couple .
The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other .
He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately .
I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing !"
She knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away .
Emma demurred .
" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"
Exquisite , quite exquisite !-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up .
Before the middle of the next day , he was at Hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme .
" The Crown !"
Oh !
Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable !-- Dreadful !-- I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield .
" I was going to observe , sir ," said Frank Churchill , " that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls !
If Mr . and Mrs . Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done ."
" Oh !"
There is no hurry at all .
That is a great thing .
I doubt it .
You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ' s great attention .
" My father and Mrs . Weston are at the Crown at this moment ," said Frank Churchill , " examining the capabilities of the house .
It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there .
" What does all that signify ?
It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight .
One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
This card - room would be wanted as a card - room now ; or , if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves , still was it not too small for any comfortable supper ?
Mrs . Weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c ., set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion .
" I do not think it _is_ so very small .
We shall not be many , you know ."
" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear .
Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ?"
She will not even listen to your questions .
I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk .
Here Mr . Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation .
We are growing a little too nice .
.
I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece ."
And away he ran .
" Very well .
If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me .-- Oh !
Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different ."
No !-- she was more and more convinced that Mrs . Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise .
Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing .
This wretched note was the finale of Emma ' s breakfast .
When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim .
He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say ,
" Our poor ball must be quite given up ."
" Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance .
Emma looked graciously .
" As you do us such ample justice now ," said Emma , laughing , " I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?
Do not we rather surpass your expectations ?
I am sure we do .
" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately .
She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in .
" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ' s being dull and insipid about the house !-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least .
I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr . Knightley will be happy .
He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes ."
So much the better .
Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give .
At last Emma attacked her on another ground .
" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr . Elton ' s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ .
It was all my doing , I know .
CHAPTER XIV
Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .
She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _recollecting_ .
She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance ;-- ease , but not elegance .-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease .
" Well , Miss Woodhouse ," said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; " Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh ,) what do you think of her ?-- Is not she very charming ?"
" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful ."
no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all .-- A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way ."
" Yes ," said Harriet earnestly , " and well she might , nobody could ever have a better .
The rich brother - in - law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him .
I have spent so many happy months there !
yes , I am quite aware of that .
Emma was silenced .
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort .
" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr . Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now ."
" Ah !
that ' s a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give .
In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it !
And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr . Woodhouse ' s spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed .
A superior performer !-- very far from it , I assure you .
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came .
I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ;-- and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree .
Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _me_ .
I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description .
I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ."
" We have been calling at Randalls ," said she , " and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be .
" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"
Emma was quite at a loss .
` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend .
" Worse than I had supposed .
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
" Well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you .
But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane ."
CHAPTER XV
Mrs . Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax ; and from the first .
" Oh !
She is very timid and silent .
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
She was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs . Elton meant to be considered .
said she .--" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !
But why must she consent to be with the Eltons ?-- Here is quite a separate puzzle ."
" Such attentions as Mrs . Elton ' s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax .
Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say .
Mr . Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago ."
He stopped .-- Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs . Weston , and did not herself know what to think .
Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her ."
no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body .
She has a fault .
Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours ."
How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?
She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper .
" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last .
CHAPTER XVI
" I see how it is ," said she .
After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr . Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him .
The persons to be invited , required little thought .
Knightley ' s words dwelt with her .
" This is very true ," said she , " at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now .
Mr . Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear -- and here would be a ninth -- and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party .
The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma .
Mr . Woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even Emma ' s vexation .
It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out .
When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for ."
" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters ."
" Indifferent !
Oh !
Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse ."
you are not serious now .
" When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years ," said John Knightley , " I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings .
A pleasant " thank you " seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh .
" My dear Jane , what is this I hear ?-- Going to the post - office in the rain !-- This must not be , I assure you .-- You sad girl , how could you do such a thing ?-- It is a sign I was not there to take care of you ."
Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable .
" You are extremely kind ," said Jane ; " but I cannot give up my early walk .
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
I have not always known their writing apart ."
" If we were in the other room ," said Emma , " if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen .
" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr .
I really am ashamed of always leading the way ."
She suspected that it _had_ ; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear , and that it had not been in vain .
If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs . Elton ' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs . Elton ' s meditated activity .
Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs . Bragge ' s is the one I would most wish to see you in ."
" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it ;-- afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself .
" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble ."
" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us .
A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."
You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr . Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."
" I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade ," replied Jane ; " governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies .
But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do ."
" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ," said Jane , " they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me .
A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery .
The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when Mr . Weston made his appearance among them .
Mr . Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before .
John Knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply .
As to her illness , all nothing of course .
Well , pretty good news , is not it ?
" I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you ," said Mr . Weston .
Mrs . Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance .
I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs . Weston .
" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !
You must take care of yourself , Mrs .
Enscombe is in Yorkshire ?"
" Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London .
Does Mrs . Churchill do the same ?"
Selina is no fine lady , I assure you .
Do not run away with such an idea ."
I always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society ."
Elton ."
He had done his duty and could return to his son .
It has been completely unexpected .
That is , _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me .
And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ?'
Now will be the time .
I think it is so .
Mrs . Weston ' s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me .
" I hope ," said he presently , " I have not been severe upon poor Mrs . Churchill .
She was the instigator .
well , that must be infinitely provoking !
I have quite a horror of upstarts .
Mr . Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him -- I believe , at least -- I am almost sure that old Mr . Suckling had completed the purchase before his death ."
He was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with --
Witness this very time .
Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party !-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ?
I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys .
Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place .
CHAPTER I
Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .
If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her :-- caution for him and for herself would be necessary .
She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .
It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been .
He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
" He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed -- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off ."
She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
His aunt could not bear to have him leave her .
He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father ' s doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever .
Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the ten days ' end , her nephew ' s letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan .
The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never .
She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
It cannot be long , I think , before she comes ."
I have never seen either Mr . or Mrs . Elton .
Mr . Weston was following ; but Mrs . Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing .
You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ ."
Very happy to hear it .
I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma ' am --.'
Quite wonderful how she does her hair !-- No hairdresser from London I think could .-- Ah !
Never better .-- Don ' t I hear another carriage ?-- Who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy Coles .-- Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends !
No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee .-- A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye ,-- no hurry -- Oh !
Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .
" Not at all ."
He had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before Emma .
said Mr . Weston .
Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs . Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying .
Mrs . Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change .
He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .
She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all .
When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr . Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs . Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances .-- The kind - hearted , gentle Mrs . Weston had left her seat to join him and say , " Do not you dance , Mr .
She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .
Mr . Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish .
you are too obliging !
My dear sir , you are too obliging .-- Is there nobody you would not rather ?-- I am not helpless .
Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps .
I am all amazement !
Oh !
Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr . Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .
" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself .-- Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs . Elton is totally without .
Every body is lazy !
CHAPTER III
It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr . Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him .
A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole .
How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word .-- More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill .-- She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more .
By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment .
This was the amount of the whole story ,-- of his communication and of Harriet ' s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech .-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs . Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr . Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
It was a very extraordinary thing !
Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury .
A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began :
" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over ."
.
" No -- I cannot call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much ."
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .
" No , indeed I do not ."
Remember it ?
when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about !
I never was equal to this ."
It was the end of an old pencil ,-- the part without any lead .
" This was really his ," said Harriet .--" Do not you remember one morning ?-- no , I dare say you do not .
Mr . Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing .
But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment ."
" I do remember it ," cried Emma ; " I perfectly remember it .-- Talking about spruce - beer .-- Oh !
I perfectly remember it .-- Stop ; Mr . Knightley was standing just here , was not he ?
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?"
" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister ?-- I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful ."
" It is one that I shall never change , however ."
Plain dealing was always best .
" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet .
We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now .-- He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity .
The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother ' s ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs . Elton ' s activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will .
Every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father ' s hints , his mother - in - law ' s guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story .
_She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose .
The gentlemen spoke of his horse .
Perry ' s setting up his carriage !
They were entering the hall .
From Frank Churchill ' s face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl .
There was no time for farther remark or explanation .
" Miss Woodhouse ," said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , " have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ?
This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer .
Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax .
If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and Harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work .
He feared there must be some decided involvement .
He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , " Nonsense !
He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , " I will give it to her -- shall I ?"
It was done however .
Mr . Knightley ' s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_ .
He remained at Hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend -- an anxious friend -- give Emma some hint , ask her some question .
I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."
" Oh !"
Churchill ."
A variety of evils crossed his mind .
Emma ' s confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged .
He owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause .
" My dear Emma ," said he at last , with earnest kindness , " do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ?"
" Between Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ?
yes , perfectly .-- Why do you make a doubt of it ?"
she cried with a most open eagerness --" Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me .
And how could it possibly come into your head ?"
" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public ."
I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade .
One cannot have too large a party .
It might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation .
Mrs . Elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .
What are we to do ?-- The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done .
leave all that to me .
Only give me a carte - blanche .-- I am Lady Patroness , you know .
you are an odd creature !"
It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing .
When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house ."
" Well -- as you please ; only don ' t have a great set out .
" You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury .
Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry .
You can borrow Mrs . Cole ' s .
I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible ."
" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs . Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens .
He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day .
The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs . Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr . Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- Mr . Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr . Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .
Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs . Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend ' s negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- Still Mrs . Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ' s post .-- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma .-- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- " Should not they walk ?
Would not Mr . Knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?-- She wished to see the whole extent ."
He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc .
I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin ."
-- She did not suspect him .
" His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them ."-- Mrs .
I shall be at home in twenty minutes ."
" Such a home , indeed !
You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up .
Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .
" I am glad I have done being in love with him .
They were looking over views in Swisserland .
" As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad ," said he .
A warm climate may be prescribed for her .
Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ?"
You are quite mistaken .
It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change .
Chuse your own degree of crossness .
The rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected .
That it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day ' s scheme , they parted .
" Well ;-- if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party , I will ."
She smiled her acceptance ; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening .
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected .
But you were humble .
You begged hard to be commanded to come ."
" Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command .
I can have no self - command without a motive .
" Your gallantry is really unanswerable .
But ( lowering her voice )-- nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people ."
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
And then whispering -- " Our companions are excessively stupid .
They _shall_ talk .
" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?"
Every body knows what is due to _you_ ."
I will attack them with more address .
Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .
That will just do for me , you know .
I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with .
I knew who it came from .
I am not one of those who have witty things at every body ' s service .
Pass us , if you please , Mr . Churchill .
How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life !"
A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards .
Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
I undertake the commission .
It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling .
We shall soon overtake her .
While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr . Knightley by her side .
" Nay , how could I help saying what I did ?-- Nobody could have helped it .
She has talked of it since .
He had turned away , and the horses were in motion .
Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life .
And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness !
They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .
She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule .
Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , " Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough ."
A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings .
` My dear ,' said I , ` you will blind yourself '-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually .
` My dear ,' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .
Nobody else would come so early .'
" Yes , all of us ; Mrs . Elton would have us come .
It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr . Knightley .
` You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us ,' said she --` I positively must have you _all_ come .'"
" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?"
I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties .'
Emma ' s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her .
I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella .
Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love ,' which nobody carries ?"
I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of .
It ought to be a first object , as I am sure poor Miss Taylor ' s always was with me .
A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle .
In one point she was fully justified .
Mr . Churchill ' s loss would be dreadful indeed .
-- Even Mr . Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , " Ah !
How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both .
Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter .
All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed .
They spoke , therefore , of Mrs . Churchill ' s death with mutual forbearance .
It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ' s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish .
Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr . Perry was uneasy about her .
In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs . Bates ' s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do ;-- Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain .
" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- Mrs . Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs . Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs . Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody ."
CHAPTER X
Mrs . Weston wants to see you .
She must see you ."
Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon ."
" No , indeed you are mistaken ."
--
Good Heavens !-- What can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?"
You will not see him .
yes -- did not you know ?-- Well , well , never mind ."
" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did ."
-- And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room ,--" I have been as good as my word .
She has not the least idea ."
It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ;" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up .)
She stopped to breathe .
What !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to Highbury ?"
" Engaged since October ,-- secretly engaged .-- It has hurt me , Emma , very much .
It has hurt his father equally .
Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , " I will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of ."
" Mr . Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself ," said she .
" On this point we have been wretched .
It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so .-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account ."
" From something that he said , my dear Emma , I rather imagine --"
Oh !
Mrs . Weston -- it is too calm a censure .
" Good God !"
Smallridge , too !
Let us have patience .
I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may .
Well , and how did Mr . Churchill take it ?"
A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate .
Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways ,-- but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_ , which made her so angry with him .
Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure .-- Her days of insignificance and evil were over .-- She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous .-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted .
This discovery laid many smaller matters open .
No doubt it had been from jealousy .-- In Jane ' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed .
" Well , Miss Woodhouse !"
replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint .
" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ," replied Emma , smiling ; " but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"
cried Emma , after a moment ' s pause --" What do you mean ?-- Good Heaven !
what do you mean ?-- Mistake you !-- Am I to suppose then ?--"
I know we agreed never to name him -- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person .
Are you speaking of -- Mr .
When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."
" My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion .
" Good God !"
At least , however , I cannot be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _is_ possible --"
" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse ," she resumed , " that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body .
But you know they were your own words , that _more_ wonderful things had happened , matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between Mr . Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before -- and if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to -- if Mr . Knightley should really -- if _he_ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way .
Harriet was standing at one of the windows .
" Yes ," replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully --" I must say that I have ."
A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress .
From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse ' s encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness !-- Latterly she had been more and more aware of it .
He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings .-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once .-- Much that lived in Harriet ' s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .
The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain .
No indeed !-- There was not a hint of Mr . Martin .
" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr . Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does ."
To that point went every leisure moment which her father ' s claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind .
How long had Mr . Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ?
This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it .-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr .
She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief .
Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr . Knightley .
She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_ .
The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course .
Mrs . Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .
" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?"
The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell .'"
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment ."
" I am afraid ," returned Emma , sighing , " that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy ."
The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear .
" If I did not know her to be happy now ," said Emma , seriously , " which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks ;-- for , oh !
I am sure she is very good -- I hope she will be very happy .
perfectly .
The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .
The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s heart and time would be occupied by it .
CHAPTER XIII
With him it was most unnatural .
said he quietly , and looking at her ; " of what nature ?"
Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure ,
" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound .-- Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father ' s sake -- I know you will not allow yourself --."
They will soon be in Yorkshire .
I am sorry for _her_ .
She wished him to speak , but he would not .
Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed -- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing .-- I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side .
She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .
" I have no doubt of their being happy together ," said Emma ; " I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached ."
returned Mr . Knightley , with energy .
And , after proceeding a few steps , she added -- " I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr . Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain .-- But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me .-- I will hear whatever you like .
The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .
Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material .-- Mr . Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .
The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself ;-- but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her .-- The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting .-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his !-- Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name .
He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .
What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
[ To Mrs .
I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence .-- You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards .
This was the fact .
I shall not discuss it here .
If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account .-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F --, who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her .-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to .
You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- No description can describe her .
And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., were highly blameable .
While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ?-- Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected .-- I was mad enough , however , to resent .-- I doubted her affection .
A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her .-- If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion .-- Miss W . calls me the child of good fortune .
I will take it home with me at night ."
By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you .
Ah !
And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , " This is very bad .-- He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could .
" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs . Smallridge ' s children -- a dear friend of Mrs . Elton ' s -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs . Elton bears the disappointment ?"
" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs . Elton .
What a letter the man writes !"
` Dearer , much dearer than ever .'
Come , he knows himself there .
-- Those were Miss Woodhouse ' s words , were they ?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter .
I hope it does him some service with you ."
She could never quit him ."
The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr . Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to .
Of their all removing to Donwell , Emma had already had her own passing thoughts .
Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .
His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback .
Mr . Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure ;-- not like Mr . Elton .
Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist .
She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied .
There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well .
She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , " Beg her to walk up ;"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging .
There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted .-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone ,
You and I shall not want opportunities .
Oh !
" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ?-- Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit ?--( here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane .)
-- And from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs . Elton for being there , Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome .-- After a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , Mrs . Elton , speaking louder , said ,
Emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , " Is Mr . Elton gone on foot to Donwell ?-- He will have a hot walk ."
" Have not you mistaken the day ?"
said Emma .
Very odd !
He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him .
In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr . Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr . Elton , if not towards William Larkins .
She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,
" Oh !"
Let us forgive each other at once .
" Very ."
She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston .
" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks --` Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ' s leave '-- something which , you knew , I did not approve .
Knightley .'
I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs . Elton , by calling you Mr . K .-- But I will promise ," she added presently , laughing and blushing --" I will promise to call you once by your Christian name .
She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella ' s letters .
The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy .
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
Emma ' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet ' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
" John does not even mention your friend ," said Mr . Knightley .
" He writes like a sensible man ," replied Emma , when she had read the letter .
" My Emma , he means no such thing .
" Emma , my dear Emma --"
" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings .
What has he been judging by ?-- I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another .-- But it was so , I suppose .
I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .'"
Mr . Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind .-- It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .
It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it .
Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
If any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps .
He told her the news .
But that would be all over now .-- Poor fellow !-- No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_ .
Oh !
After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with ,
" Oh !
but why so ?-- I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."
" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ?"
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin ."
Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."
It seems an impossibility !-- You cannot mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin .
-- Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , " Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me .
" It is a very simple story .
He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John .-- He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley ' s .
They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley ' s .
This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness .
She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad .
His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma .-- You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin ."
_Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ .
how peculiarly unprepared I was !-- for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before ."
cried Mr . Knightley .
poor Harriet !"
She wanted to be alone .
He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us .-- They are coming in , I hope ."
Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side .
They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
When Mr . Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation -- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say ,
said he , turning his eyes towards Jane .
But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon .-- Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing .
Let me return your congratulations .-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction .-- He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise ."
" I have always admired her complexion ," replied Emma , archly ; " but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ?-- When we first began to talk of her .-- Have you quite forgotten ?"
" Oh !
It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it ."
I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown .
He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma ' s feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr . Knightley ' s high superiority of character .
She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out .
But Mr . Woodhouse -- how was Mr . Woodhouse to be induced to consent ?-- he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event .
FINIS
" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq ., great grandson of the second Sir Walter ."
She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .
Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot ' s death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow .
The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq ., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her .
He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .
As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; " For they must have been seen together ," he observed , " once at Tattersall ' s , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons ."
Yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again .
It had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter .
She felt herself ill - used and unfortunate , as did her father ; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity , or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne .
But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth .
" If we can persuade your father to all this ," said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , " much may be done .
How Anne ' s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence .
No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms ."
There had been three alternatives , London , Bath , or another house in the country .
Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred .
Kellynch Hall was to be let .
Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all .
Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted .
It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father ' s house , with the additional burden of two children .
She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .
Chapter 3
" I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with .
The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing .
One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top .
` In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ?'
` Sixty ,' said I , ` or perhaps sixty - two .'
" Nay , Sir Walter ," cried Mrs Clay , " this is being severe indeed .
Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman ' s family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added --
A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world .
what was his name ?
At this moment I cannot recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately .
After waiting another moment --
It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen .
An admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small .
In all their dealings and intercourse , Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence .
A short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one .
Such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for Anne ; but Lady Russell saw it very differently .
It only added a dangerous character to himself .
He had left the country in consequence .
More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ), or in any novelty or enlargement of society .
She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter ' s , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father ' s house , and settled so permanently near herself .
She was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .
That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature ' s having heard of it from him .
The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him ."
Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to Anne , in Mrs Clay ' s being of so much use , while Anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation .
She had little hope of success ; but Elizabeth , who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought , have reason to reproach her for giving no warning .
The party drove off in very good spirits ; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves , and Anne walked up at the same time , in a sort of desolate tranquillity , to the Lodge , where she was to spend the first week .
Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband .
Charles is out shooting .
I assure you , I have not seen a soul this whole long morning ."
Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad ."
" You know I always cure you when I come .
I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father ' s books and pictures .
I was told that they wished it .
I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party ."
I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning .
A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne ' s side produced nearly a cure on Mary ' s .
" Where shall we go ?"
Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it .
The Musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement .
Their children had more modern minds and manners .
They were received with great cordiality .
Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family , which was generally , as Anne very well knew , the least to blame .
She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove : " So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ?"
She could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell .
She acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into .
Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort .
He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife ' s occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne ' s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ), they might pass for a happy couple .
They are quite different creatures with you !
I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; " don ' t do this ," and " don ' t do that ;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them ."
And on Mrs Musgrove ' s side , it was , " I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law ' s concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you , Miss Anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles ' s nursery - maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near .
Again , it was Mary ' s complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place .
She could not think of much else on the 29th of September ; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary , who , on having occasion to note down the day of the month , exclaimed , " Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ?
They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression .
" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country ."
Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not .
" Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ?"
She could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when Mrs Croft ' s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother .
He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c ., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question .
She could not , however , reach such a degree of certainty , as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house , where the Crofts had previously been calling .
The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in .
That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage .
I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard !
), they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma ' s head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard ' s captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow !
But a week must pass ; only a week , in Anne ' s reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .
His collar - bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas .
" Oh no ; as to leaving the little boy ," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and Anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs .
The child had a good night , and was going on well the next day .
The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible ; but what was there for a father to do ?
This is always my luck .
I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy .
" I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about .
It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima .
Oh !
He was to come to breakfast , but not at the Cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead , and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove ' s way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in Charles ' s being to meet him to breakfast at his father ' s .
He wished to avoid seeing her .
The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child ' s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice .
" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me .
Frederick Wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her .
It was now his object to marry .
This was his only secret exception , when he said to his sister , in answer to her suppositions :--
Chapter 8
Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; they could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth .
When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind .
" You will not find her there .
I was the last man who commanded her .
But they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed ."
Lucky fellow to get her !
Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his ."
What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ?
" But , Captain Wentworth ," cried Louisa , " how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you ."
" And so then , I suppose ," said Mrs Musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , " so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy .
" It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know .
Charles , being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case , only nodded in reply , and walked away .
Poor Harville , sister !
He had a wife .
He felt it all , so much for her sake .
" My brother ," whispered one of the girls ; " mamma is thinking of poor Richard ."
it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you .
They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove .
It was no insignificant barrier , indeed .
" Oh !
I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man - of - war .
" My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth ."
my dear ," said the Admiral , " when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune .
We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife ."
" Now I have done ," cried Captain Wentworth .
I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft ," was Mrs Musgrove ' s hearty answer .
" There is nothing so bad as a separation .
She is never tired of playing ."
She had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of .
The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .
` Lady Wentworth ' sounds very well .
It would be but a new creation , however , and I never think much of your new creations ."
A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross ."
No , no ; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter ; and if she has him , and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied ."
But Charles is so positive !
" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say ," had been Anne ' s reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself .
There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off .
She could not stay .
Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise .
One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house .
They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills .
They talked of coming into this side of the country .
Oh !
" Had you ?"
said Charles Musgrove , and " No , no !"
But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , " Oh !
Anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other .
" Oh !
I wish she had accepted him .
This long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be Admiral Croft ' s gig .
The invitation was general , and generally declined .
If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four .
She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her , which all these things made apparent .
Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given .
She then found them talking of " Frederick ."
" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy ," said the Admiral ; " but there is no saying which .
But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung - cart ; and Anne , with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs , found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage .
These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough .
After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .
They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion .
" And yet ," said Anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , " he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have .
Captain Benwick looked , and was , the youngest of the three , and , compared with either of them , a little man .
Captain Harville , though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners , was a perfect gentleman , unaffected , warm , and obliging .
Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth ' s company than she had at first imagined could ever be , that the sitting down to the same table with him now , and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it ( they never got beyond ), was become a mere nothing .
While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne ' s lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .
He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening ' s indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation .
When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .
He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over - scrupulous I must say .
Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ?
They were all at her disposal .
It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves ; and this second meeting , short as it was , also proved again by the gentleman ' s looks , that he thought hers very lovely , and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies , that he was a man of exceedingly good manners .
Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London ."
When she could command Mary ' s attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .
Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street .
" The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again .
Anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .
Mrs Harville ' s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves .
" She is dead !
" Is there no one to help me ?"
her father and mother !"
By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb , and many were collected near them , to be useful if wanted , at any rate , to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady , nay , two dead young ladies , for it proved twice as fine as the first report .
She must be taken to their house ; all must go to their house ; and await the surgeon ' s arrival there .
The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible .
That he did not regard it as a desperate case , that he did not say a few hours must end it , was at first felt , beyond the hope of most ; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve , the rejoicing , deep and silent , after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered , may be conceived .
It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done , as to their general situation .
They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect .
She expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain .
How the long stage would pass ; how it was to affect their manners ; what was to be their sort of intercourse , she could not foresee .
It was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , Henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth .
I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove .
In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville ' s exertions as a nurse .
It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others , and increase his own distress ; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon .
" What should they do without her ?
She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved .
She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character .
If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again .
It had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from .
The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest .
She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath .
She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell ' s eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa .
She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners '.
An ancient family to be so driven away !
" Now , this must be very bad for you ," said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , " to be coming and finding us here .
But ," ( checking himself ), " you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler ' s room .
Ay , so it always is , I believe .
I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father ' s .
A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot ," ( looking with serious reflection ), " I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life .
And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this .
Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man .
on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood ,' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come .
I cannot pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms !
` Elegance , sweetness , beauty .'
" I must see Captain Benwick before I decide ," said Lady Russell , smiling .
I am sure you will not like him ."
Do you think Lady Russell would like that ?"
He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch .
On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others .
Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .
Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home , before her brothers and sisters went to school again .
This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being " a man whom she had no wish to see ."
Her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness .
Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after .
A very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him !
In a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance .
Mr Elliot , and his friends in Marlborough Buildings , were talked of the whole evening .
" He longed to see her .
" How is Mary looking ?"
said Sir Walter , in the height of his good humour .
" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse ."
and so late !
It was ten o ' clock .
Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; " Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter " ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ); and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was .
He staid an hour with them .
As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath .
" No , nothing ."
" Merely Gowland ," he supposed .
he was surprised at that ;" and added , " certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are ; you cannot be better than well ; or I should recommend Gowland , the constant use of Gowland , during the spring months .
Such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened .
But everything must take its chance .
The evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if Elizabeth were also to marry .
As for herself , she might always command a home with Lady Russell .
The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .
As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others .
His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , " Can this be Mr Elliot ?"
Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay .
In Lady Russell ' s view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth .
He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness .
It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister ' s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them .
It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots ."
The toils of the business were over , the sweets began .
My cousin Anne shakes her head .
Will it make you happy ?
I suppose " ( smiling ) " I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them ."
" Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims .
As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread - cases , pin - cushions and card - racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood .
Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ` the best education in the world ,' know nothing worth attending to .
Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to .
Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing !
And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting .
Sir Walter , Elizabeth and Mrs Clay , returned one morning from Laura Place , with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening , and Anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings .
asked Elizabeth .
A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings !
Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell .
Anne was obliged to turn away , to rise , to walk to a distant table , and , leaning there in pretended employment , try to subdue the feelings this picture excited .
The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of " Lady Elliot " first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist .
Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open .
" What is this ?"
" Oh !
those letters are convenient passports .
" My dear Anne ,-- I make no apology for my silence , because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath .
You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross , which , as you well know , affords little to write about .
The holidays , however , are over at last : I believe no children ever had such long ones .
I am sure I had not .
Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long .
I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately ; they think the Admiral gouty .
I do not think they improve at all as neighbours .
Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville .
Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister ' s account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both .
I hope he will be more agreeable now .
I think not .
Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel !
She saw no reason against their being happy .
Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike .
He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him .
The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for , and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form , and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure .
( laughing heartily ); " I would not venture over a horsepond in it .
Yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and I have something to tell you as we go along .
There , take my arm ; that ' s right ; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there .
" Yes , I have , presently .
as we pass , however .
They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men .
But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about .
Nay , most likely they are married already , for I do not know what they should wait for ."
She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick ' s manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , " I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends ," but the Admiral interrupted her with --
" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end ."
" Yes , yes , I understand you .
But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter .
Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther .
While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne , and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath , Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither .
It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple ' s carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland ' s , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance .
It was fixed accordingly , that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when Anne , as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly , Captain Wentworth walking down the street .
She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed .
He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was .
No comparison .
How would it all be ?
The following morning Anne was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down Pulteney Street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street .
" I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme .
I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time ."
Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing .
But I have no reason to suppose it so .
It seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me .
" I should very much like to see Lyme again ," said Anne .
" Indeed !
So much novelty and beauty !
" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple ," was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her .
Her happiness was from within .
Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed ; but she knew nothing about it .
She was thinking only of the last half hour , and as they passed to their seats , her mind took a hasty range over it .
She could not contemplate the change as implying less .
When their places were determined on , and they were all properly arranged , she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way .
for shame !
" I knew you by report long before you came to Bath .
She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain .
" No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now .
He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her ."
Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared , I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change ."
Such , she believed , were his words ; but scarcely had she received their sound , than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her , which rendered every thing else trivial .
Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking .
Irish , I dare say ."
She wished him not so near her .
The first act was over .
Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing - saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea .
The anxious interval wore away unproductively .
there were very different thoughts to succeed .
How was such jealousy to be quieted ?
It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way .
" The little Durands were there , I conclude ," said she , " with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed .
They never miss a concert ."
I need not ask after her .
Anne half smiled and said , " Do you see that in my eye ?"
Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together ."
" Mr Elliot !"
It is a great while since we met ."
You must consider me only as Mr Elliot ' s relation .
If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me ."
I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week .
Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed --
I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs .
Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody .
I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ?"
Ninety - nine out of a hundred would do the same .
You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character .
He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin ."
Surely this must be calm enough .
Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ), I shall not accept him .
She stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient .
" The whole history ," repeated Anne , laughing .
" No , I thank you : no , certainly not .
I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you .
You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him .
Facts shall speak .
The intimacy had been formed before our marriage .
I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him .
It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister .
I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time .
My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him .
" Perhaps ," cried Anne , struck by a sudden idea , " you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ?"
" Oh !
" Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard .
Her father was a grazier , her grandfather had been a butcher , but that was all nothing .
" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet ."
He is worse than last year .
" I wish I had any name but Elliot .
But it shows you the man .
She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say --
His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart .
you are acquainted with him ?"
Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left ."
Did he see you last summer or autumn , ` somewhere down in the west ,' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ?"
At Lyme .
He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced .
I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied .
I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not ."
Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay .
` Why , to be sure , ma ' am ,' said she , ` it would not prevent his marrying anybody else .'
Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness ."
She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence .
There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation .
She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich .
I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband .
He was very unkind to his first wife .
But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her .
And under such a supposition , which would have been most miserable , when time had disclosed all , too late ?
In one point , her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot .
She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him .
She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith , but here was a reward indeed springing from it !
But this was a vain idea .
However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together .
They appear to so much advantage in company with each other .
" Oh !
If you will have such ideas !
exclaimed Mrs Clay , lifting her hands and eyes , and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence .
When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him ."
It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along .
On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell , and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion .
you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through .
Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications .
" And mine ," added Sir Walter .
Anne , remembering the preconcerted visits , at all hours , of Mr Elliot , would have expected him , but for his known engagement seven miles off .
They had arrived late the night before .
That ' s the worst of him ."
I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both ."
Money , you know , coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it cannot be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things .
However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it .
It is very fit they should have daughters ' shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me .
She never did , you know .
I cannot make her attend to the value of the property .
Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old .
I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ?"
If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long ."
We had a famous set - to at rat - hunting all the morning in my father ' s great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since ."
Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present .
A large party in an hotel ensured a quick - changing , unsettled scene .
The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment .
It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again .
Good heavens !
You seem to have forgot all about Lyme ."
A ' n ' t I a good boy ?
I have engaged Captain Wentworth .
How can you be so forgetful ?"
You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play ."
Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying --
But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps ."
" You were not formerly , I know .
Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her .
It was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the " Miss Elliot at home ," were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth .
The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing - room .
She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance .
She generally thought he would come , because she generally thought he ought ; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion , as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings .
She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay ' s face as she listened .
It was transient : cleared away in an instant ; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having , by some complication of mutual trick , or some overbearing authority of his , been obliged to attend ( perhaps for half an hour ) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter .
dear !
Chapter 23
Her faith was plighted , and Mr Elliot ' s character , like the Sultaness Scheherazade ' s head , must live another day .
At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement ."
It is what I always protested against for my children .
Anne found an unexpected interest here .
" Yes , and you may guess who it is for .
He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another !
" That I can easily believe ."
He has not been forced upon any exertion .
The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since ."
" True ," said Anne , " very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ?
Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own .
I shall have done in five minutes ."
I will not allow books to prove anything ."
" We never shall .
I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts !"
I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman .
No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives .
Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully .
Mrs Croft left them , and Captain Wentworth , having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which shewed impatience to be gone .
Anne knew not how to understand it .
You alone have brought me to Bath .
You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others .
She must not walk ."
But the chair would never do .
" To be sure I will , if you wish it .
He joined them ; but , as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on , said nothing , only looked .
Presently , struck by a sudden thought , Charles said --
" I hardly know ," replied Captain Wentworth , surprised .
That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours .
He persisted in having loved none but her .
In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ), he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa ' s could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own .
To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal .
I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences ."
Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come ?
Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said , but the concert still more .
That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments .
Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared ?
How could I look on without agony ?
" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different .
If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk .
He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation --
" Not yet .
I did not understand you .
This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself .
I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed .
" I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune .
They might in fact , have borne down a great deal more than they met with , for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth .
This however was what Lady Russell had now to do .
There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes .
To those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself .
Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart .
Finis
Their estate was large , and their residence was at Norland Park , in the centre of their property , where , for many generations , they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance .
But her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr . Henry Dashwood , the legal inheritor of the Norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it .
By his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth .
He was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ;-- but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest .
Had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was :-- he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife .
It would be enough to make them completely easy .
Marianne ' s abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to Elinor ' s .
Mrs . John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland ; and her mother and sisters - in - law were degraded to the condition of visitors .
In seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself .
She begged him to think again on the subject .
" He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time .
But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time .
If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition ."
They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them .
His wife hesitated a little , however , in giving her consent to this plan .
" Fifteen years !
You are not aware of what you are doing .
One ' s fortune , as your mother justly says , is NOT one ' s own .
I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly .
Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that ?-- They will live so cheap !
" Upon my word ," said Mr . Dashwood , " I believe you are perfectly right .
" But , however , ONE thing must be considered .
Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it ."
Mrs . Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections .
The contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter - in - law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year ' s residence in her family afforded ; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of Mrs . Dashwood , to her daughters ' continuance at Norland .
This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs . John Dashwood , a gentleman - like and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister ' s establishment at Norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there .
It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality .
It implies everything amiable .
I love him already ."
Her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve .
--
" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose .
But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility .
Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love .
Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ?
In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from her ' s !"
Marianne was afraid of offending , and said no more on the subject ; but the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people , was very far from that rapturous delight , which , in her opinion , could alone be called taste .
She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account , and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible .
" Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits .
" Of his sense and his goodness ," continued Elinor , " no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation .
What say you , Marianne ?"
worse than cold - hearted !
Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth .
Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister .
But , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common ,) to make her uncivil .
She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother ' s great expectations , of Mrs . Ferrars ' s resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN ; that Mrs . Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm .
It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire .
She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry .
Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance .
No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done .-- The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter .
HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland .
" Dear , dear Norland !"
The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant .
A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front ; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it .
As a house , Barton Cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles .
Four bed - rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house .
They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy .
He had formerly visited at Stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him .
His kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game .
Her manners had all the elegance which her husband ' s wanted .
But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark .
The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate .
In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor .
He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements .
In the evening , as Marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play .
She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel ' s advanced state of life which humanity required .
CHAPTER 8
said Elinor , " do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ?
and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ?"
" Mamma , you are not doing me justice .
Even now her self - command is invariable .
When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ?"
The house and the garden , with all the objects surrounding them , were now become familiar , and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford , since the loss of their father .
The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks .
The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned .
One consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety ; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate .
A gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne , when her accident happened .
Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour .
" Willoughby !"
" Upon my soul ," said he , " I do not know much about him as to all THAT .
I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible ."
Sir John did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then replied ,
" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other .
The same books , the same passages were idolized by each -- or if any difference appeared , any objection arose , it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed .
He acquiesced in all her decisions , caught all her enthusiasm ; and long before his visit concluded , they conversed with the familiarity of a long - established acquaintance .
" Elinor ," cried Marianne , " is this fair ?
To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by Marianne ' s perfect recovery .
She was confined for some days to the house ; but never had any confinement been less irksome .
They read , they talked , they sang together ; his musical talents were considerable ; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted .
Colonel Brandon ' s partiality for Marianne , which had so early been discovered by his friends , now first became perceptible to Elinor , when it ceased to be noticed by them .
and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent .
" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy ."
" That is to say ," cried Marianne contemptuously , " he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome ."
" Add to which ," cried Marianne , " that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit .
That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression ."
If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it .
Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment .
Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs . Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse .
She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times ; and had Elinor ' s memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr . Jenning ' s last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died .
Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent .
" No ," replied Elinor , " her opinions are all romantic ."
" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist ."
" I cannot agree with you there ," said Elinor .
After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying ,--
You shall share its use with me .
Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them .
I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama .
She knew her sister ' s temper .
His concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice ,--" But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you cannot use it now .
I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair ."
When Mrs . Jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was Elinor ' s particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , Margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , " I must not tell , may I , Elinor ?"
" I never had any conjectures about it ," replied Margaret ; " it was you who told me of it yourself ."
This increased the mirth of the company , and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more .
The idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them .
The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years .
To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight ;-- and Mrs . Dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home .
said Sir John .
" None at all , ma ' am , I thank you ."
" No , ma ' am .
" We must go ," said Sir John .--" It shall not be put off when we are so near it .
" If you would but let us know what your business is ," said Mrs . Jennings , " we might see whether it could be put off or not ."
--
Brandon is one of them .
Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable .
" Well , then , when will you come back again ?"
added Sir John .
" No .
But you had better change your mind ."
He then took leave of the whole party .
He wished her a good morning , and , attended by Sir John , left the room .
We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies ."
When Sir John returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country .
The carriages were then ordered ; Willoughby ' s was first , and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it .
It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long .
Some more of the Careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which Sir John observed with great contentment .
Mrs . Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr . Willoughby ' s groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house .
" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ?
" Mr . Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion .
" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ?"
" I could see it in his face .
The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved .
I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ?
Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her .
Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture , and all seeming equally probable as they arose .
Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all , than Willoughby ' s behaviour .
The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home ; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham ; and if no general engagement collected them at the park , the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there , where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne , and by his favourite pointer at her feet .
he exclaimed --" Improve this dear cottage !
" Do not be alarmed ," said Miss Dashwood , " nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it ."
But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ?"
" To me it is faultless .
" Yes ," cried he in the same eager tone , " with all and every thing belonging to it ;-- in no one convenience or INconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible .
Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton ."
" Your promise makes me easy .
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them .
" I hope not ," he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , " It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment !"
I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you ."
" To London !-- and are you going this morning ?"
" Almost this moment ."
Elinor felt equal amazement .
Mrs . Dashwood felt too much for speech , and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned .
Willoughby ' s behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother ' s invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her .
But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister ' s affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty .
He did not speak , he did not behave like himself .
" It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see THAT .
" Yes .
And now , Elinor , what have you to say ?"
But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him .
Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has .
" Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary .
But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us ."
How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister ' s love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection ;-- that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ?"
You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together .
" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him ."
" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain .
But I require no such proof .
" I hope not , I believe not ," cried Elinor .
But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed .
Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby .
She would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning , had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it .
The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling .
In books too , as well as in music , she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving .
We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John ' s hands ."
" Why do you not ask Marianne at once ," said she , " whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ?
At any rate it would be most ungenerous .
" Months !"
Amongst the objects in the scene , they soon discovered an animated one ; it was a man on horseback riding towards them .
It is not Willoughby .
He dismounted , and giving his horse to his servant , walked back with them to Barton , whither he was purposely coming to visit them .
Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise .
The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves ."
Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can .
said Marianne to herself as she walked on .
" No , not all ," answered Marianne ; " we could not be more unfortunately situated ."
His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all , and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible .
said Marianne , " money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it .
YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting .
Elinor smiled again , to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna .
cried Marianne , her eyes sparkling with animation , and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness .
I wonder what I should do with it !"
" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ?"
" But gaiety never was a part of MY character ."
" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes ," said Elinor , " in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated .
" No , Marianne , never .
You must not confound my meaning .
" Quite the contrary ," replied Elinor , looking expressively at Marianne .
CHAPTER 18
Elinor saw , with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend .
Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses .
I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees .
I remember her promising to give you some .
The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know ."
That the hair was her own , she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne ; the only difference in their conclusions was , that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister , Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself .
On the present occasion , for the better entertainment of their visitor , towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute , he wished to engage them for both .
Who is to dance ?"
This , and Marianne ' s blushing , gave new suspicions to Edward .
" And who is Willoughby ?"
" What do you mean ?"
Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby ' s service , by her mother .
As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing .
Such behaviour as this , so exactly the reverse of her own , appeared no more meritorious to Marianne , than her own had seemed faulty to her .
That her sister ' s affections WERE calm , she dared not deny , though she blushed to acknowledge it ; and of the strength of her own , she gave a very striking proof , by still loving and respecting that sister , in spite of this mortifying conviction .
they will hear you ."
" Never mind if they do .
It is only the Palmers .
She came hallooing to the window , " How do you do , my dear ?
Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs . Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs . Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John .
Mr . Palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper .
" Mr . Palmer does not hear me ," said she , laughing ; " he never does sometimes .
Mrs . Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm .
" Here comes Marianne ," cried Sir John .
I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever ."
Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them .
Mrs . Jennings and Mrs . Palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield .
" I am so glad to see you !"
They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation .
I could get the nicest house in world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square .
" Oh , don ' t be so sly before us ," said Mrs . Palmer ; " for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome .
Not above ten miles , I dare say ."
I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place ."
" Then you would be very ill - bred ," cried Mr . Palmer .
" My love you contradict every body ," said his wife with her usual laugh .
I am sure you will like it of all things .
You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr . Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming !
It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M . P .-- But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ?
He declares he won ' t .
Don ' t palm all your abuses of languages upon me ."
I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know ."
" Don ' t pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of .
" My dear Mrs .
Surely you must be mistaken .
To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do ."
Is it true , pray ?
He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing ."
You can ' t think how much I longed to see you !
I believe ," she added in a low voice , " he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could .
CHAPTER 21
As it was impossible , however , now to prevent their coming , Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with all the philosophy of a well - bred woman , contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day .
The young ladies arrived : their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable .
Sir John ' s confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles ' arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world .
Benevolent , philanthropic man !
When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person .-- Their manners were particularly civil , and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton .
With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight .
It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing .
" John is in such spirits today !"
And soon afterwards , on the second boy ' s violently pinching one of the same lady ' s fingers , she fondly observed , " How playful William is !"
The mother ' s consternation was excessive ; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles , and every thing was done by all three , in so critical an emergency , which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer .
With such a reward for her tears , the child was too wise to cease crying .
" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is !"
I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always ."
For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil .
But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him ."
Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward ' s visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention .
repeated Miss Steele ; " Mr . Ferrars is the happy man , is he ?
CHAPTER 22
It was broken by Lucy , who renewed the subject again by saying , with some hesitation ,
" I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious .
Astonishment , that would have been as painful as it was strong , had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it .
" You may well be surprised ," continued Lucy ; " for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour .
Elinor , though greatly shocked , still felt unable to believe it .
" Mr . Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs . Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs . John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends ."
" It is strange ," replied Elinor , in a most painful perplexity , " that I should never have heard him even mention your name ."
Lucy spoke first .
I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman ."
Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication .
She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t ' other day , when Edward ' s name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all .
" Sometimes ."
continued Lucy , after wiping her eyes , " I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely ."
" Writing to each other ," said Lucy , returning the letter into her pocket , " is the only comfort we have in such long separations .
Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT .
However small Elinor ' s general dependence on Lucy ' s veracity might be , it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case , where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description .
What Lucy had asserted to be true , therefore , Elinor could not , dared not longer doubt ; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs , and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes .
No ; whatever it might once have been , she could not believe it such at present .
One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles .
" I am glad ," said Lady Middleton to Lucy , " you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria ' s basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight .
And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it ."
CHAPTER 24
I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again ."
" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it .
I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived ."
But Mrs . Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward ' s sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures ."
Lucy bit her lip , and looked angrily at her sister .
" Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little ."
If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having ."
" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do ."
" How unlucky that is !
I had quite depended upon meeting you there .
From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself .
The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied .
So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it ."
Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better ."
" I am delighted with the plan ," she cried , " it is exactly what I could wish .
Marianne ' s countenance sunk .
" I will have you BOTH go ," said Mrs . Dashwood ; " these objections are nonsensical .
With regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not , and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence .
Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs . Jennings , and beginning a journey to London under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that lady been , so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition , and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before !
They were three days on their journey , and Marianne ' s behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs . Jennings might be expected to be .
They reached town by three o ' clock the third day , glad to be released , after such a journey , from the confinement of a carriage , and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire .
said he .
Mrs . Jennings soon came in .
Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome .
But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ?
Elinor now began to make the tea , and Marianne was obliged to appear again .
The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day .
" How odd , indeed !"
The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements ; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others .
Marianne was of no use on these occasions , as she would never learn the game ; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal , the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor , for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment .
Poor souls !
" I had not thought of that .
It was a lucky recollection , all her good spirits were restored by it .
There seems to me a very decided difference .
It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton .
She insisted on being left behind , the next morning , when the others went out .
cried Marianne , stepping hastily forward .
said Elinor , unable to be longer silent .
" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from YOU -- you who have confidence in no one !"
Mr . and Mrs . Palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother - in - law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance .
" Did you ?"
Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it .
Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening .
Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains ."
CHAPTER 28
They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs . Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure .
After some time spent in saying little or doing less , Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino , and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about , she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs , placed themselves at no great distance from the table .
why does he not look at me ?
At last he turned round again , and regarded them both ; she started up , and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection , held out her hand to him .
Her face was crimsoned over , and she exclaimed , in a voice of the greatest emotion , " Good God !
Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ?
Have you not received my letters ?
Will you not shake hands with me ?"
After a moment ' s pause , he spoke with calmness .
Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven ' s sake tell me , what is the matter ?"
Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street .
Marianne was in a silent agony , too much oppressed even for tears ; but as Mrs . Jennings was luckily not come home , they could go directly to their own room , where hartshorn restored her a little to herself .
That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt , and that Willoughby was weary of it , seemed equally clear ; for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes , SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind .
Her indignation would have been still stronger than it was , had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct , and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first , without any design that would bear investigation .
Before the house - maid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in January , Marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window - seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her .
" Marianne , may I ask -?"
" No , Elinor ," she replied , " ask nothing ; you will soon know all ."
The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction .
Pray , when are they to be married ?"
Mrs . Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her .
Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne ' s .
I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions .
how unhappy I make you !"
Elinor , I am miserable , indeed ," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs .
but do not torture me so .
how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion !
Have you no comforts ?
Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ?
Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period -- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it .
He has broken no faith with me ."
Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain .
I have been told that you were asked to be of the party .
But could it be so ?
You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion .
My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; I wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer .
If your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession .
That such letters , so full of affection and confidence , could have been so answered , Elinor , for Willoughby ' s sake , would have been unwilling to believe .
This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication .
" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby ."
" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ?
Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you .
Whatever he might have heard against me -- ought he not to have suspended his belief ?
" No , Marianne , in no possible way ."
no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself ."
I came only for Willoughby ' s sake -- and now who cares for me ?
" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I cannot stay here long , I cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people .
Mrs . Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was .
And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it .
Elinor , who did justice to Mrs . Jennings ' s kindness , though its effusions were often distressing , and sometimes almost ridiculous , made her those acknowledgments , and returned her those civilities , which her sister could not make or return for herself .
She treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays .
" Poor soul !"
Lord !
I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man .
No wonder !
" Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ?
Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone .
" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs . Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr . Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister .
yes , that I do indeed .
It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world .
after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter !"
Elinor , for her sister ' s sake , could not press the subject farther , and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby ' s ; since , though Marianne might lose much , he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth .
how he ' ll chuckle over this news !
I hope he will come tonight .
how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there !
To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother .
" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma ' am ," said Elinor , " we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon ."
My astonishment !-- but it would be impossible to describe what I felt .
But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ?
It has been , it is a most cruel affliction .
From a night of more sleep than she had expected , Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes .
Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness .
The work of one moment was destroyed by the next .
But the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort .
Her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by Elinor ' s application , to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for Willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it .
" It is Colonel Brandon !"
said she , with vexation .
" We are never safe from HIM ."
" I understand you ," said Elinor .
The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs . Brandon ' s , was but too natural .
A few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure .
Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person .
At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her .
Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given .
But to what does all this lead ?
I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all .
" Good heavens !"
Little did Mr . Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but HAD he known it , what would it have availed ?
" This is beyond every thing !"
" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both .
I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister ' s influence might yet reclaim him .
She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing .
" I could meet him no other way .
We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad ."
Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it .
To give the feelings or the language of Mrs . Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor ' s letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said ; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne ' s , and an indignation even greater than Elinor ' s .
Design could never bring them in each other ' s way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage , which Mrs . Dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one .
Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby ' s name mentioned , was not thrown away .
It was an unaccountable business .
Mrs . Palmer , in her way , was equally angry .
Every qualification is raised at times , by the circumstances of the moment , to more than its real value ; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good - breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good - nature .
Colonel Brandon ' s delicate , unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood .
Early in February , within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby ' s letter , Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married .
The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married ; and Elinor now hoped , as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them , to prevail on her sister , who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell , to go out again by degrees as she had done before .
" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL ," said she repeatedly , with a strong emphasis on the word .
But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point .
" Not in the stage , I assure you ," replied Miss Steele , with quick exultation ; " we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us .
" Oh , oh !"
and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you ."
" I am sorry we cannot see your sister , Miss Dashwood ," said Miss Steele .
" I am sorry she is not well --" for Marianne had left the room on their arrival .
Elinor , with great civility , declined the proposal .
After some opposition , Marianne yielded to her sister ' s entreaties , and consented to go out with her and Mrs . Jennings one morning for half an hour .
All that could be done was , to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession ; one gentleman only was standing there , and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch .
But the correctness of his eye , and the delicacy of his taste , proved to be beyond his politeness .
Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward , was on the point of concluding it , when another gentleman presented himself at her side .
But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected .
After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton .
The weather was remarkably fine , and she readily consented .
Is he a man of fortune ?"
He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life ."
Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family .
In short , it is a kind of thing that "-- lowering his voice to an important whisper --" will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES ."
And yet it is not very unlikely ."
" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth ."
Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother .
" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther .
Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far ."
" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks ."
She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man .
I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors ."
But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both ."
The same manners , however , which recommended Mrs . John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs . Jennings , and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud - looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband ' s sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence .
The intelligence however , which SHE would not give , soon flowed from another quarter .
He dared not come to Bartlett ' s Buildings for fear of detection , and though their mutual impatience to meet , was not to be told , they could do nothing at present but write .
Twice was his card found on the table , when they returned from their morning ' s engagements .
Their sisters and Mrs . Jennings were invited likewise , and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon , who , always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were , received his eager civilities with some surprise , but much more pleasure .
Their claims to the notice of Mrs . John Dashwood , as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother , might not have done much , however , towards procuring them seats at her table ; but as Lady Middleton ' s guests they must be welcome ; and Lucy , who had long wanted to be personally known to the family , to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties , and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them , had seldom been happier in her life , than she was on receiving Mrs . John Dashwood ' s card .
" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood !"
In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate , and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss , nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it ;-- no poverty of any kind , except of conversation , appeared -- but there , the deficiency was considerable .
John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing , and his wife had still less .
Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough ,-- for , colouring a little , she immediately said ,
" Beautifully indeed !
But SHE does every thing well ."
" Poor Marianne !"
" My dear friend ," cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , " I come to talk to you of my happiness .
Now was not it so ?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ?"
" She was certainly very civil to you ."
" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement ," said she , " nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you ;-- but as that was not the case "--
They are both delightful women , indeed !-- I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs . Dashwood was !"
" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it .
They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it .
When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne ' s joy hurried her into the drawing - room immediately .
she cried , " this is a moment of great happiness !-- This would almost make amends for every thing ?"
Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt .
Again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy ' s unwelcome presence .
Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne ' s altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her .
Elinor is well , you see .
I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none .
The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven !
In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge ."
Poor Edward muttered something , but what it was , nobody knew , not even himself .
But Marianne , who saw his agitation , and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself , was perfectly satisfied , and soon talked of something else .
" Could not she see that we wanted her gone !-- how teazing to Edward !"
CHAPTER 36
Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles , by whom their company , in fact was as little valued , as it was professedly sought .
Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton ' s behaviour to Elinor and Marianne , she did not really like them at all .
But so little were they , anymore than the others , inclined to oblige her , that if Sir John dined from home , she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject , than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself .
She joined them sometimes at Sir John ' s , sometimes at her own house ; but wherever it was , she always came in excellent spirits , full of delight and importance , attributing Charlotte ' s well doing to her own care , and ready to give so exact , so minute a detail of her situation , as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire .
One thing DID disturb her ; and of that she made her daily complaint .
Mr . Palmer maintained the common , but unfatherly opinion among his sex , of all infants being alike ; and though she could plainly perceive , at different times , the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides , there was no convincing his father of it ; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age ; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world .
But that was not enough ; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong , they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them .
Marianne had now been brought by degrees , so much into the habit of going out every day , that it was become a matter of indifference to her , whether she went or not : and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening ' s engagement , though without expecting the smallest amusement from any , and very often without knowing , till the last moment , where it was to take her .
The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies , moreover , was generally concluded with a compliment , which though meant as its douceur , was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all ; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown , the colour of her shoes , and the arrangement of her hair , she was almost sure of being told that upon " her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests ."
The events of this evening were not very remarkable .
The party , like other musical parties , comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance , and a great many more who had none at all ; and the performers themselves were , as usual , in their own estimation , and that of their immediate friends , the first private performers in England .
Why they WERE different , Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour ' s conversation ; for , talking of his brother , and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society , he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency , than to the misfortune of a private education ; while he himself , though probably without any particular , any material superiority by nature , merely from the advantage of a public school , was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man .
" Upon my soul ," he added , " I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it .
My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi ' s .
Lady Elliott wished to give a dance .
How can I ask them away from her ?"
Fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to Lucy , to request her company and her sister ' s , for some days , in Harley Street , as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them .
Mrs . Dashwood seemed actually working for her , herself ; cherishing all her hopes , and promoting all her views !
Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton , and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs . John Dashwood ; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater .
my dear Miss Dashwood !
for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may .
I have no pity for either of them .
I have no notion of people ' s making such a to - do about money and greatness .
As Mrs . Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion .
But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it .
She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward ' s engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne .
But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither .
has he written to you ?"
After a pause of wonder , she exclaimed --
" Four months !-- and yet you loved him !"
I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther .
I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so .
She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration .-- She attended to all that Mrs . Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard three times to say , " Yes , ma ' am ."
But I would not alarm you too much .
Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing .
' I wish , with all my heart ,' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , ' that we had asked your sisters instead of them .'"
If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter .
' THERE , to be sure ,' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe .'
Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded .
can this be possible !"
Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement .
He therefore replied , without any resentment ,
Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible .
And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle ' s care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs . Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary .
" I am sorry to say , ma ' am , in a most unhappy rupture :-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother ' s notice .
" Poor young man !-- and what is to become of him ?"
I cannot conceive a situation more deplorable .
We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him ."
cried Mrs . Jennings , " I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him .
It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns ."
" If he would only have done as well by himself ," said John Dashwood , " as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing .
" Well !"
The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars , was so fine , so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens , though it was only the second week in March .
You see I cannot leave Mrs .
" That is a good thing .
And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ?"
" I cannot suppose it possible that she should ."
But why should not I wear pink ribbons ?
I do not care if it IS the Doctor ' s favourite colour .
Whatever Lucy might think about it herself , you know , it was no business of other people to set it down for certain ."
" Oh , did not you ?
And after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that ?-- He could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself .
I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be .
La !
Miss Dashwood , do you think people make love when any body else is by ?
Oh , for shame !-- To be sure you must know better than that .
" Oh , la !
there is nothing in THAT .
I only stood at the door , and heard what I could .
Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind .
They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living .
As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs . Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known .
I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart .-- She calls me dear Mrs . Jennings , you see .
Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge .
Mrs . Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland .
Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother ' s concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be ;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton .
Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods ;"-- was Mrs . Jennings ' s address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled --" for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers ;-- and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back !-- Lord !
She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette .
what should hinder it ?"
I understand that he intends to take orders .
If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present .
" Well , Miss Dashwood ," said Mrs . Jennings , sagaciously smiling , as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn , " I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business .
I an ' t the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen ."
" You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel ' s general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur ."
" Oh !
Mr . Ferrars is to be the man .
Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy !
He too was much distressed ; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment .-- Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room , he could not recollect ; but determining to be on the safe side , he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing , after taking a chair .
I go to Oxford tomorrow ."
Mrs . Jennings was quite right in what she said .
Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable .
Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a - year -- were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness ."
" Colonel Brandon !"
" No ," replied be , with sudden consciousness , " not to find it in YOU ; for I cannot be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , I owe it all .-- I feel it -- I would express it if I could -- but , as you well know , I am no orator ."
I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift .
He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman ."
" Indeed ," replied Elinor , " I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house ,) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this ."
When Mrs . Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared .
Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already ."
NOW especially there cannot be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites .-- Why would not Marianne come ?"
Elinor made what excuse she could for her .
This living of Colonel Brandon ' s -- can it be true ?-- has he really given it to Edward ?-- I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it ."
" Really !-- Well , this is very astonishing !-- no relationship !-- no connection between them !-- and now that livings fetch such a price !-- what was the value of this ?"
" It is truly astonishing !"
Ferrars ."
" But why should such precaution be used ?-- Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs . Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon ,-- for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all ?-- She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise .
" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair ."
" Choice !-- how do you mean ?"
But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you .
Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor .
There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered .
After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister ' s being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother ' s love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother ' s integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart .
" We may treat it as a joke ," said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment --" but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business .
Poor Edward !
But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier -- I think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on .
He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs . John Dashwood put an end to the subject .
But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself .
Very early in April , and tolerably early in the day , the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective homes , to meet , by appointment , on the road .
In such moments of precious , invaluable misery , she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland ; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house , feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty , of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude , she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers , in the indulgence of such solitary rambles .
But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs . Jennings ' s suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two ;-- she watched his eyes , while Mrs . Jennings thought only of his behaviour ;-- and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne ' s feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady ' s observation ;-- SHE could discover in them the quick feelings , and needless alarm of a lover .
Prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined .
Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night ' s rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies .
Mrs . Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne ' s complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr . Harris ' s report , and confirming Charlotte ' s fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr . Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood .
On the morning of the third day however , the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away ; for when Mr . Harris arrived , he declared his patient materially better .
Mrs . Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper ' s room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne .
" Is mama coming ?--"
and Marianne , still talking wildly of mama , her alarm increased so rapidly , as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr . Harris , and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother .
Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister ' s danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope .
The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her ;-- and as for their mother , when Mrs . Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere .
About noon , however , she began -- but with a caution -- a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent , even to her friend -- to fancy , to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister ' s pulse ;-- she waited , watched , and examined it again and again ;-- and at last , with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness , than all her foregoing distress , ventured to communicate her hopes .
The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view .
Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm , as at that moment .
CHAPTER 44
" With me !"
The possibility of Colonel Brandon ' s arriving and finding her there , came across her .
He rose up , and walked across the room .
" Mr . Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe -- I am not at leisure to remain with you longer .-- Whatever your business may be with me , will it be better recollected and explained to - morrow ."
" I do not know ," said he , after a pause of expectation on her side , and thoughtfulness on his own ,--" how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me .-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me ,-- it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing .
But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it .
Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing .-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject ."
At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display .
Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther ," he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye --" your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago ."
But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me --( may I say it ?)
--
Do not think yourself excused by any weakness , any natural defect of understanding on her side , in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours .
" Well , sir , and what said Mrs .
That could not be -- and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house .
The night following this affair -- I was to go the next morning -- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be .
The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone .
But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling .
Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately -- I never shall forget it -- united too with such reliance , such confidence in me !-- Oh , God !-- what a hard - hearted rascal I was !"
" I do not know what I told her ," he replied , impatiently ; " less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future .
" Well , sir ," said Elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , " and this is all ?"
" Yes , I saw every note that passed ."
" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time ,) what I felt is -- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion -- my feelings were very , very painful .-- Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart .
Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear ."
Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs . Jennings ' s .
The next morning brought another short note from Marianne -- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful .
But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day .
It was a horrid sight !-- yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world .
Willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus :
You saw what she said .
" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to .
Preparation !-- day !-- In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture .
And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched ?-- It must have been only to one end .
" You are very wrong , Mr . Willoughby , very blamable ," said Elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; " you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs . Willoughby or my sister .
You had made your own choice .
You tell me that she has forgiven me already .
" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification .
What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ?
Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper .
Vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed .
" And you DO think something better of me than you did ?"
Elinor stopped him with a reproof .
" Well ,"-- he replied --" once more good bye .
She can never be more lost to you than she is now ."
Good bye ,-- God bless you !"
She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge .
She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend ;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon ' s hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment .
Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward .
But Mrs . Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it .
And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two ."
But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men ."
What answer did you give him ?-- Did you allow him to hope ?"
Marianne might at that moment be dying .
Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power .
Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything ;-- Marianne ' s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby .-- His own merits must soon secure it ."
There , however , he is quite mistaken .
His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed ;-- and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy .
Elinor could NOT remember it ;-- but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued ,
" And his manners , the Colonel ' s manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby ' s ever were , but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne .
" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me ," added Mrs . Dashwood , " even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability ,-- for I hear it is a large village ,-- indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation ."
On HER measures depended those of her two friends ; Mrs . Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods ' stay ; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable .
The day of separation and departure arrived ; and Marianne , after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs . Jennings , one so earnestly grateful , so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention , and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend , was carefully assisted by him into the carriage , of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half .
After dinner she would try her piano - forte .
But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon .
Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity .
" There , exactly there ,"-- pointing with one hand , " on that projecting mound ,-- there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby ."
Her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added ,
--
I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are NOW .-- At present , if I could be satisfied on one point , if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part , not ALWAYS deceiving me ;-- but above all , if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl "--
She stopt .
He will suffer enough in them ."
" Our situations have borne little resemblance ."
Had I died ,-- it would have been self - destruction .
Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged .
Every body seemed injured by me .
I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me ?-- not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself .-- Your example was before me ; but to what avail ?-- Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ?
" You are very good .-- The future must be my proof .
> From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance .
She caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister ' s , and tears covered her cheeks .
Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged .
" I wish to assure you both ," said she , " that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do ."
in a tone that implied --" do you really think him selfish ?"
" At present ," continued Elinor , " he regrets what he has done .
But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ?-- The inconveniences would have been different .
He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing .
She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures .
" I suppose you know , ma ' am , that Mr . Ferrars is married ."
Mrs . Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant ' s inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor ' s countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne ' s situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention .
The servant , who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with Mrs . Dashwood ' s assistance , supported her into the other room .
" Who told you that Mr . Ferrars was married , Thomas ?"
They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys .
She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts .
" Was Mr . Ferrars in the carriage with her ?"
" Do you know where they came from ?"
" Yes , ma ' am -- but not to bide long .
" Did you see them off , before you came away ?"
" Yes , ma ' am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented ."
She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor ' s representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne .
She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wont to believe , or than it was now proved to be .
" When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma ' am ?"
It was a gentleman , it was Colonel Brandon himself .
Not a syllable passed aloud .
They all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor .
" At Longstaple !"
-- was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ;-- and though Elinor could not speak , even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder .
His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful .
He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love ;-- and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire .
He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness ;-- and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before .
She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects .
Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week ;-- for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor ' s company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future ;-- for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different .
How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration ,-- a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out .
To her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle .
Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper .
" I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity .
In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ?
The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single ."
NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place .
It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other ' s acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise .
Mr . Dashwood ' s strains were more solemn .
" I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister ," said John , as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House , " THAT would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is .
What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son , might have puzzled many people to find out ; and what Robert had done to succeed to it , might have puzzled them still more .
It was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in Robert ' s style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much ;-- and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange .
Elinor ' s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her .
His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity .
Mrs . Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs . Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover .
Between Barton and Delaford , there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate ;-- and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne , let it not be ranked as the least considerable , that though sisters , and living almost within sight of each other , they could live without disagreement between themselves , or producing coolness between their husbands .

thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done .
20 : 10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham , What sawest thou , that thou hast done this thing ?
20 : 11 And Abraham said , Because I thought , Surely the fear of God is not in this place ; and they will slay me for my wife ' s sake .
21 : 8 And the child grew , and was weaned : and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned .
21 : 19 And God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
21 : 31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba ; because there they sware both of them .
21 : 34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines ' land many days .
22 : 3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
22 : 4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
22 : 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
And he said , Behold the fire and the wood : but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?
22 : 9 And they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
22 : 10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
22 : 19 So Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beersheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba .
22 : 23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah : these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor , Abraham ' s brother .
23 : 13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land , saying , But if thou wilt give it , I pray thee , hear me : I will give thee money for the field ; take it of me , and I will bury my dead there .
24 : 10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
24 : 17 And the servant ran to meet her , and said , Let me , I pray thee , drink a little water of thy pitcher .
24 : 18 And she said , Drink , my lord : and she hasted , and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
24 : 22 And it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ; 24 : 23 And said , Whose daughter art thou ?
24 : 33 And there was set meat before him to eat : but he said , I will not eat , until I have told mine errand .
24 : 45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
24 : 63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
24 : 65 For she had said unto the servant , What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us ?
25 : 9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ; 25 : 10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth : there was Abraham buried , and Sarah his wife .
25 : 12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael , Abraham ' s son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah ' s handmaid , bare unto Abraham : 25 : 13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam , 25 : 14 And Mishma , and Dumah , and Massa , 25 : 15 Hadar , and Tema , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah : 25 : 16 These are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their towns , and by their castles ; twelve princes according to their nations .
25 : 25 And the first came out red , all over like an hairy garment ; and they called his name Esau .
26 : 8 And it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
26 : 17 And Isaac departed thence , and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar , and dwelt there .
26 : 20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac ' s herdmen , saying , The water is ours : and he called the name of the well Esek ; because they strove with him .
26 : 22 And he removed from thence , and digged another well ; and for that they strove not : and he called the name of it Rehoboth ; and he said , For now the LORD hath made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
26 : 25 And he builded an altar there , and called upon the name of the LORD , and pitched his tent there : and there Isaac ' s servants digged a well .
26 : 32 And it came to pass the same day , that Isaac ' s servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had digged , and said unto him , We have found water .
27 : 19 And Jacob said unto his father , I am Esau thy first born ; I have done according as thou badest me : arise , I pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless me .
27 : 23 And he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother Esau ' s hands : so he blessed him .
27 : 32 And Isaac his father said unto him , Who art thou ?
27 : 36 And he said , Is not he rightly named Jacob ?
28 : 6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob , and sent him away to Padanaram , to take him a wife from thence ; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan ; 28 : 7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to Padanaram ; 28 : 8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father ; 28 : 9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham ' s son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
28 : 12 And he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
And they said , Of Haran are we .
29 : 7 And he said , Lo , it is yet high day , neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together : water ye the sheep , and go and feed them .
29 : 12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father ' s brother , and that he was Rebekah ' s son : and she ran and told her father .
And he told Laban all these things .
And he abode with him the space of a month .
wherefore then hast thou beguiled me ?
29 : 28 And Jacob did so , and fulfilled her week : and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also .
29 : 29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid .
29 : 33 And she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , Because the LORD hath heard I was hated , he hath therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Simeon .
30 : 4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife : and Jacob went in unto her .
30 : 7 And Bilhah Rachel ' s maid conceived again , and bare Jacob a second son .
30 : 13 And Leah said , Happy am I , for the daughters will call me blessed : and she called his name Asher .
30 : 14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah .
30 : 19 And Leah conceived again , and bare Jacob the sixth son .
30 : 22 And God remembered Rachel , and God hearkened to her , and opened her womb .
30 : 28 And he said , Appoint me thy wages , and I will give it .
30 : 30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came , and it is now increased unto a multitude ; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming : and now when shall I provide for mine own house also ?
30 : 31 And he said , What shall I give thee ?
And Jacob said , Thou shalt not give me any thing : if thou wilt do this thing for me , I will again feed and keep thy flock .
30 : 39 And the flocks conceived before the rods , and brought forth cattle ringstraked , speckled , and spotted .
30 : 42 But when the cattle were feeble , he put them not in : so the feebler were Laban ' s , and the stronger Jacob ' s .
31 : 6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father .
31 : 10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and , behold , the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked , speckled , and grisled .
31 : 20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
thou hast now done foolishly in so doing .
31 : 30 And now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after thy father ' s house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
31 : 38 This twenty years have I been with thee ; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young , and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten .
31 : 44 Now therefore come thou , let us make a covenant , I and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
31 : 55 And early in the morning Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them : and Laban departed , and returned unto his place .
32 : 1 And Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
32 : 9 And Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the LORD which saidst unto me , Return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and I will deal well with thee : 32 : 10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto thy servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
32 : 11 Deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
32 : 13 And he lodged there that same night ; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother ; 32 : 14 Two hundred she goats , and twenty he goats , two hundred ewes , and twenty rams , 32 : 15 Thirty milch camels with their colts , forty kine , and ten bulls , twenty she asses , and ten foals .
32 : 16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
32 : 27 And he said unto him , What is thy name ?
33 : 8 And he said , What meanest thou by all this drove which I met ?
33 : 10 And Jacob said , Nay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou wast pleased with me .
And he urged him , and he took it .
34 : 1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
34 : 3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
34 : 9 And make ye marriages with us , and give your daughters unto us , and take our daughters unto you .
34 : 11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren , Let me find grace in your eyes , and what ye shall say unto me I will give .
34 : 24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
35 : 5 And they journeyed : and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob .
35 : 15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him , Bethel .
35 : 27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre , unto the city of Arbah , which is Hebron , where Abraham and Isaac sojourned .
36 : 1 Now these are the generations of Esau , who is Edom .
36 : 17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau ' s son ; duke Nahath , duke Zerah , duke Shammah , duke Mizzah : these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau ' s wife .
36 : 22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam ; and Lotan ' s sister was Timna .
36 : 26 And these are the children of Dishon ; Hemdan , and Eshban , and Ithran , and Cheran .
36 : 27 The children of Ezer are these ; Bilhan , and Zaavan , and Akan .
36 : 29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites ; duke Lotan , duke Shobal , duke Zibeon , duke Anah , 36 : 30 Duke Dishon , duke Ezer , duke Dishan : these are the dukes that came of Hori , among their dukes in the land of Seir .
37 : 1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger , in the land of Canaan .
37 : 2 These are the generations of Jacob .
37 : 8 And his brethren said to him , Shalt thou indeed reign over us ?
come , and I will send thee unto them .
37 : 14 And he said to him , Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the flocks ; and bring me word again .
So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
37 : 15 And a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
37 : 21 And Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
37 : 27 Come , and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh .
38 : 4 And she conceived again , and bare a son ; and she called his name Onan .
38 : 26 And Judah acknowledged them , and said , She hath been more righteous than I ; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son .
38 : 30 And afterward came out his brother , that had the scarlet thread upon his hand : and his name was called Zarah .
39 : 4 And Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
39 : 20 And Joseph ' s master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king ' s prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
39 : 23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the LORD was with him , and that which he did , the LORD made it to prosper .
40 : 7 And he asked Pharaoh ' s officers that were with him in the ward of his lord ' s house , saying , Wherefore look ye so sadly to day ?
40 : 8 And they said unto him , We have dreamed a dream , and there is no interpreter of it .
And Joseph said unto them , Do not interpretations belong to God ?
41 : 1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years , that Pharaoh dreamed : and , behold , he stood by the river .
41 : 4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine .
41 : 27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years ; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine .
41 : 33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of Egypt .
41 : 37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
41 : 38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants , Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
41 : 44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I am Pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt .
41 : 51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh : For God , said he , hath made me forget all my toil , and all my father ' s house .
42 : 23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them ; for he spake unto them by an interpreter .
42 : 24 And he turned himself about from them , and wept ; and returned to them again , and communed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
42 : 33 And the man , the lord of the country , said unto us , Hereby shall I know that ye are true men ; leave one of your brethren here with me , and take food for the famine of your households , and be gone : 42 : 34 And bring your youngest brother unto me : then shall I know that ye are no spies , but that ye are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
43 : 2 And it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said unto them , Go again , buy us a little food .
have ye another brother ?
43 : 11 And their father Israel said unto them , If it must be so now , do this ; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels , and carry down the man a present , a little balm , and a little honey , spices , and myrrh , nuts , and almonds : 43 : 12 And take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight : 43 : 13 Take also your brother , and arise , go again unto the man : 43 : 14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may send away your other brother , and Benjamin .
If I be bereaved of my children , I am bereaved .
43 : 18 And the men were afraid , because they were brought into Joseph ' s house ; and they said , Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in ; that he may seek occasion against us , and fall upon us , and take us for bondmen , and our asses .
43 : 22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food : we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks .
43 : 23 And he said , Peace be to you , fear not : your God , and the God of your father , hath given you treasure in your sacks : I had your money .
And they bowed down their heads , and made obeisance .
43 : 29 And he lifted up his eyes , and saw his brother Benjamin , his mother ' s son , and said , Is this your younger brother , of whom ye spake unto me ?
43 : 34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him : but Benjamin ' s mess was five times so much as any of their ' s .
And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
44 : 4 And when they were gone out of the city , and not yet far off , Joseph said unto his steward , Up , follow after the men ; and when thou dost overtake them , say unto them , Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good ?
44 : 9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord ' s bondmen .
wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine ?
or how shall we clear ourselves ?
God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord ' s servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
44 : 25 And our father said , Go again , and buy us a little food .
44 : 26 And we said , We cannot go down : if our youngest brother be with us , then will we go down : for we may not see the man ' s face , except our youngest brother be with us .
44 : 27 And thy servant my father said unto us , Ye know that my wife bare me two sons : 44 : 28 And the one went out from me , and I said , Surely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since : 44 : 29 And if ye take this also from me , and mischief befall him , ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
45 : 9 Haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , Thus saith thy son Joseph , God hath made me lord of all Egypt : come down unto me , tarry not : 45 : 10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and thy children , and thy children ' s children , and thy flocks , and thy herds , and all that thou hast : 45 : 11 And there will I nourish thee ; for yet there are five years of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
45 : 20 Also regard not your stuff ; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your ' s .
45 : 21 And the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
45 : 23 And to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
46 : 1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to Beersheba , and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac .
46 : 8 And these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob ' s firstborn .
46 : 25 These are the sons of Bilhah , which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter , and she bare these unto Jacob : all the souls were seven .
47 : 3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren , What is your occupation ?
47 : 4 They said morever unto Pharaoh , For to sojourn in the land are we come ; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen .
47 : 5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph , saying , Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee : 47 : 6 The land of Egypt is before thee ; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell ; in the land of Goshen let them dwell : and if thou knowest any men of activity among them , then make them rulers over my cattle .
47 : 9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh , The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years : few and evil have the days of the years of my life been , and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage .
47 : 20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh ; for the Egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them : so the land became Pharaoh ' s .
47 : 21 And as for the people , he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof .
47 : 26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth part , except the land of the priests only , which became not Pharaoh ' s .
And he said , I will do as thou hast said .
48 : 3 And Jacob said unto Joseph , God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan , and blessed me , 48 : 4 And said unto me , Behold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
48 : 11 And Israel said unto Joseph , I had not thought to see thy face : and , lo , God hath shewed me also thy seed .
48 : 14 And Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it upon Ephraim ' s head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Manasseh ' s head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for Manasseh was the firstborn .
48 : 15 And he blessed Joseph , and said , God , before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk , the God which fed me all my life long unto this day , 48 : 16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
49 : 16 Dan shall judge his people , as one of the tribes of Israel .
49 : 17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way , an adder in the path , that biteth the horse heels , so that his rider shall fall backward .
49 : 20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainties .
49 : 33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
50 : 2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father : and the physicians embalmed Israel .
50 : 3 And forty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed : and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days .
50 : 4 And when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pray you , in the ears of Pharaoh , saying , 50 : 5 My father made me swear , saying , Lo , I die : in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan , there shalt thou bury me .
50 : 6 And Pharaoh said , Go up , and bury thy father , according as he made thee swear .
And he comforted them , and spake kindly unto them .
50 : 25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bones from hence .
1 : 2 Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah , 1 : 3 Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin , 1 : 4 Dan , and Naphtali , Gad , and Asher .
1 : 9 And he said unto his people , Behold , the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we : 1 : 10 Come on , let us deal wisely with them ; lest they multiply , and it come to pass , that , when there falleth out any war , they join also unto our enemies , and fight against us , and so get them up out of the land .
And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities , Pithom and Raamses .
2 : 11 And it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
2 : 14 And he said , Who made thee a prince and a judge over us ?
2 : 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away : but Moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
call him , that he may eat bread .
2 : 22 And she bare him a son , and he called his name Gershom : for he said , I have been a stranger in a strange land .
And he said , Here am I .
3 : 10 Come now therefore , and I will send thee unto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
3 : 18 And they shall hearken to thy voice : and thou shalt come , thou and the elders of Israel , unto the king of Egypt , and ye shall say unto him , The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us : and now let us go , we beseech thee , three days ' journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God .
3 : 22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
And he said , A rod .
4 : 6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him , Put now thine hand into thy bosom .
have not I the LORD ?
4 : 14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses , and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ?
And Jethro said to Moses , Go in peace .
4 : 25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , Surely a bloody husband art thou to me .
4 : 26 So he let him go : then she said , A bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision .
why is it that thou hast sent me ?
6 : 1 Then the LORD said unto Moses , Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
6 : 2 And God spake unto Moses , and said unto him , I am the LORD : 6 : 3 And I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them .
6 : 8 And I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the LORD .
6 : 13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
6 : 18 And the sons of Kohath ; Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel : and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years .
6 : 21 And the sons of Izhar ; Korah , and Nepheg , and Zichri .
6 : 26 These are that Aaron and Moses , to whom the LORD said , Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
7 : 13 And he hardened Pharaoh ' s heart , that he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
8 : 2 And if thou refuse to let them go , behold , I will smite all thy borders with frogs : 8 : 3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into thy bedchamber , and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thine ovens , and into thy kneadingtroughs : 8 : 4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee , and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants .
8 : 6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
8 : 9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh , Glory over me : when shall I intreat for thee , and for thy servants , and for thy people , to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses , that they may remain in the river only ?
8 : 10 And he said , To morrow .
8 : 16 And the LORD said unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch out thy rod , and smite the dust of the land , that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
8 : 18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
8 : 22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth .
8 : 23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be .
8 : 25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron , and said , Go ye , sacrifice to your God in the land .
8 : 27 We will go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to the LORD our God , as he shall command us .
8 : 28 And Pharaoh said , I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : intreat for me .
8 : 31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
9 : 4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children ' s of Israel .
9 : 10 And they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven ; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast .
9 : 14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
9 : 16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
9 : 18 Behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
9 : 20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses : 9 : 21 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field .
9 : 26 Only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , was there no hail .
10 : 10 And he said unto them , Let the LORD be so with you , as I will let you go , and your little ones : look to it ; for evil is before you .
10 : 15 For they covered the face of the whole earth , so that the land was darkened ; and they did eat every herb of the land , and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left : and there remained not any green thing in the trees , or in the herbs of the field , through all the land of Egypt .
10 : 24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses , and said , Go ye , serve the LORD ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed : let your little ones also go with you .
11 : 8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out .
12 : 12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the LORD .
12 : 14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
12 : 15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
12 : 16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
12 : 37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
12 : 41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt .
12 : 45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof .
12 : 51 And it came to pass the selfsame day , that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
14 : 22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
14 : 23 And the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh ' s horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
14 : 31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians : and the people feared the LORD , and believed the LORD , and his servant Moses .
15 : 5 The depths have covered them : they sank into the bottom as a stone .
15 : 9 The enemy said , I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfied upon them ; I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them .
who is like thee , glorious in holiness , fearful in praises , doing wonders ?
15 : 17 Thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O LORD , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanctuary , O LORD , which thy hands have established .
15 : 21 And Miriam answered them , Sing ye to the LORD , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
15 : 24 And the people murmured against Moses , saying , What shall we drink ?
16 : 1 And they took their journey from Elim , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
16 : 2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness : 16 : 3 And the children of Israel said unto them , Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt , when we sat by the flesh pots , and when we did eat bread to the full ; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness , to kill this whole assembly with hunger .
16 : 17 And the children of Israel did so , and gathered , some more , some less .
16 : 19 And Moses said , Let no man leave of it till the morning .
16 : 21 And they gathered it every morning , every man according to his eating : and when the sun waxed hot , it melted .
16 : 26 Six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
16 : 28 And the LORD said unto Moses , How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws ?
16 : 35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
17 : 3 And the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
18 : 10 And Jethro said , Blessed be the LORD , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
18 : 21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens : 18 : 22 And let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
19 : 2 For they were departed from Rephidim , and were come to the desert of Sinai , and had pitched in the wilderness ; and there Israel camped before the mount .
19 : 5 Now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine : 19 : 6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and an holy nation .
These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel .
19 : 7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him .
And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD .
20 : 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain ; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
20 : 18 And all the people saw the thunderings , and the lightnings , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people saw it , they removed , and stood afar off .
20 : 22 And the LORD said unto Moses , Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel , Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
20 : 24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings , and thy peace offerings , thy sheep , and thine oxen : in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee , and I will bless thee .
21 : 1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them .
21 : 12 He that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death .
21 : 16 And he that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
21 : 18 And if men strive together , and one smite another with a stone , or with his fist , and he die not , but keepeth his bed : 21 : 19 If he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
21 : 20 And if a man smite his servant , or his maid , with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall be surely punished .
21 : 32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
22 : 4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall restore double .
22 : 6 If fire break out , and catch in thorns , so that the stacks of corn , or the standing corn , or the field , be consumed therewith ; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution .
22 : 7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man ' s house ; if the thief be found , let him pay double .
22 : 10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass , or an ox , or a sheep , or any beast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or driven away , no man seeing it : 22 : 11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour ' s goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
22 : 13 If it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
22 : 29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liquors : the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
23 : 5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , and wouldest forbear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .
In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard , and with thy oliveyard .
23 : 21 Beware of him , and obey his voice , provoke him not ; for he will not pardon your transgressions : for my name is in him .
23 : 27 I will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
23 : 29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year ; lest the land become desolate , and the beast of the field multiply against thee .
24 : 3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice , and said , All the words which the LORD hath said will we do .
24 : 5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel , which offered burnt offerings , and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD .
24 : 12 And the LORD said unto Moses , Come up to me into the mount , and be there : and I will give thee tables of stone , and a law , and commandments which I have written ; that thou mayest teach them .
24 : 14 And he said unto the elders , Tarry ye here for us , until we come again unto you : and , behold , Aaron and Hur are with you : if any man have any matters to do , let him come unto them .
25 : 11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou overlay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
25 : 27 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table .
25 : 29 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof , and spoons thereof , and covers thereof , and bowls thereof , to cover withal : of pure gold shalt thou make them .
25 : 31 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work shall the candlestick be made : his shaft , and his branches , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , shall be of the same .
25 : 37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof : and they shall light the lamps thereof , that they may give light over against it .
26 : 9 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves , and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle .
26 : 15 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up .
26 : 23 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
26 : 35 And thou shalt set the table without the vail , and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south : and thou shalt put the table on the north side .
27 : 7 And the staves shall be put into the rings , and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar , to bear it .
27 : 21 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail , which is before the testimony , Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD : it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel .
28 : 2 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty .
28 : 3 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted , whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom , that they may make Aaron ' s garments to consecrate him , that he may minister unto me in the priest ' s office .
28 : 15 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work ; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it ; of gold , of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine twined linen , shalt thou make it .
28 : 39 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen , and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen , and thou shalt make the girdle of needlework .
28 : 41 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him ; and shalt anoint them , and consecrate them , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest ' s office .
28 : 42 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness ; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach : 28 : 43 And they shall be upon Aaron , and upon his sons , when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation , or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place ; that they bear not iniquity , and die : it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him .
29 : 3 And thou shalt put them into one basket , and bring them in the basket , with the bullock and the two rams .
29 : 9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles , Aaron and his sons , and put the bonnets on them : and the priest ' s office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute : and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons .
29 : 19 And thou shalt take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
29 : 29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons ' after him , to be anointed therein , and to be consecrated in them .
30 : 4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it , by the two corners thereof , upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it ; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal .
30 : 5 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold .
30 : 6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with thee .
30 : 15 The rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the LORD , to make an atonement for your souls .
30 : 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 30 : 18 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass , and his foot also of brass , to wash withal : and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar , and thou shalt put water therein .
30 : 26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith , and the ark of the testimony , 30 : 27 And the table and all his vessels , and the candlestick and his vessels , and the altar of incense , 30 : 28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels , and the laver and his foot .
30 : 30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons , and consecrate them , that they may minister unto me in the priest ' s office .
30 : 33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , shall even be cut off from his people .
30 : 38 Whosoever shall make like unto that , to smell thereto , shall even be cut off from his people .
31 : 14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it is holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
31 : 15 Six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest , holy to the LORD : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
32 : 11 And Moses besought the LORD his God , and said , LORD , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
32 : 12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak , and say , For mischief did he bring them out , to slay them in the mountains , and to consume them from the face of the earth ?
32 : 14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people .
32 : 17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said unto Moses , There is a noise of war in the camp .
33 : 4 And when the people heard these evil tidings , they mourned : and no man did put on him his ornaments .
33 : 5 For the LORD had said unto Moses , Say unto the children of Israel , Ye are a stiffnecked people : I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment , and consume thee : therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee , that I may know what to do unto thee .
33 : 9 And it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the Lord talked with Moses .
33 : 10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rose up and worshipped , every man in his tent door .
And he turned again into the camp : but his servant Joshua , the son of Nun , a young man , departed not out of the tabernacle .
33 : 15 And he said unto him , If thy presence go not with me , carry us not up hence .
34 : 4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the LORD had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
34 : 12 Take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee : 34 : 13 But ye shall destroy their altars , break their images , and cut down their groves : 34 : 14 For thou shalt worship no other god : for the LORD , whose name is Jealous , is a jealous God : 34 : 15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ; 34 : 16 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods .
34 : 19 All that openeth the matrix is mine ; and every firstling among thy cattle , whether ox or sheep , that is male .
34 : 21 Six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
34 : 30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
34 : 33 And till Moses had done speaking with them , he put a vail on his face .
34 : 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
35 : 24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD ' s offering : and every man , with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
35 : 27 And the rulers brought onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ; 35 : 28 And spice , and oil for the light , and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
35 : 29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses .
And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning .
So the people were restrained from bringing .
36 : 9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : the curtains were all of one size .
36 : 23 And he made boards for the tabernacle ; twenty boards for the south side southward : 36 : 24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
37 : 9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
37 : 10 And he made the table of shittim wood : two cubits was the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof : 37 : 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold , and made thereunto a crown of gold round about .
37 : 14 Over against the border were the rings , the places for the staves to bear the table .
38 : 21 This is the sum of the tabernacle , even of the tabernacle of testimony , as it was counted , according to the commandment of Moses , for the service of the Levites , by the hand of Ithamar , son to Aaron the priest .
38 : 22 And Bezaleel the son Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah , made all that the LORD commanded Moses .
39 : 12 And the third row , a ligure , an agate , and an amethyst .
39 : 13 And the fourth row , a beryl , an onyx , and a jasper : they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings .
39 : 16 And they made two ouches of gold , and two gold rings ; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate .
39 : 21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
39 : 43 And Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they had done it as the LORD had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
40 : 9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
40 : 22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation , upon the side of the tabernacle northward , without the vail .
40 : 23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD ; as the LORD had commanded Moses .
40 : 28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle .
So Moses finished the work .
40 : 34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation , and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle .
2 : 8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD : and when it is presented unto the priest , he shall bring it unto the altar .
2 : 9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof , and shall burn it upon the altar : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
2 : 10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron ' s and his sons ': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire .
2 : 15 And thou shalt put oil upon it , and lay frankincense thereon : it is a meat offering .
3 : 5 And Aaron ' s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
3 : 16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour : all the fat is the LORD ' s .
4 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 4 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them : 4 : 3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering .
4 : 7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD , which is in the tabernacle of the congregation ; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
4 : 22 When a ruler hath sinned , and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done , and is guilty ; 4 : 23 Or if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a male without blemish : 4 : 24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
5 : 4 Or if a soul swear , pronouncing with his lips to do evil , or to do good , whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath , and it be hid from him ; when he knoweth of it , then he shall be guilty in one of these .
5 : 11 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering .
5 : 19 It is a trespass offering : he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD .
I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the trespass offering .
6 : 22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever unto the LORD ; it shall be wholly burnt .
6 : 24 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 6 : 25 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons , saying , This is the law of the sin offering : In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD : it is most holy .
6 : 26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation .
7 : 7 As the sin offering is , so is the trespass offering : there is one law for them : the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it .
7 : 19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten ; it shall be burnt with fire : and as for the flesh , all that be clean shall eat thereof .
8 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 8 : 2 Take Aaron and his sons with him , and the garments , and the anointing oil , and a bullock for the sin offering , and two rams , and a basket of unleavened bread ; 8 : 3 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
8 : 17 But the bullock , and his hide , his flesh , and his dung , he burnt with fire without the camp ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
8 : 23 And he slew it ; and Moses took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron ' s right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot .
8 : 28 And Moses took them from off their hands , and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering : they were consecrations for a sweet savour : it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
8 : 35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the LORD , that ye die not : for so I am commanded .
9 : 1 And it came to pass on the eighth day , that Moses called Aaron and his sons , and the elders of Israel ; 9 : 2 And he said unto Aaron , Take thee a young calf for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering , without blemish , and offer them before the LORD .
9 : 11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp .
10 : 4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
10 : 6 And Moses said unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons , Uncover not your heads , neither rend your clothes ; lest ye die , and lest wrath come upon all the people : but let your brethren , the whole house of Israel , bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled .
12 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 12 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be unclean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean .
12 : 3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised .
13 : 4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days : 13 : 5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in his sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more : 13 : 6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him clean : it is but a scab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
13 : 9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought unto the priest ; 13 : 10 And the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it have turned the hair white , and there be quick raw flesh in the rising ; 13 : 11 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean , and shall not shut him up : for he is unclean .
13 : 38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ; 13 : 39 Then the priest shall look : and , behold , if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white ; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin ; he is clean .
13 : 40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head , he is bald ; yet is he clean .
13 : 43 Then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head , or in his bald forehead , as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh ; 13 : 44 He is a leprous man , he is unclean : the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean ; his plague is in his head .
13 : 45 And the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent , and his head bare , and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip , and shall cry , Unclean , unclean .
13 : 59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen , either in the warp , or woof , or any thing of skins , to pronounce it clean , or to pronounce it unclean .
14 : 30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves , or of the young pigeons , such as he can get ; 14 : 31 Even such as he is able to get , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , with the meat offering : and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD .
14 : 33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying , 14 : 34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ; 14 : 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house : 14 : 36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house , before the priest go into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made unclean : and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house : 14 : 37 And he shall look on the plague , and , behold , if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes , greenish or reddish , which in sight are lower than the wall ; 14 : 38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days : 14 : 39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ; 14 : 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is , and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city : 14 : 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about , and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place : 14 : 42 And they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
14 : 48 And if the priest shall come in , and look upon it , and , behold , the plague hath not spread in the house , after the house was plaistered : then the priest shall pronounce the house clean , because the plague is healed .
15 : 6 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
15 : 19 And if a woman have an issue , and her issue in her flesh be blood , she shall be put apart seven days : and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even .
15 : 24 And if any man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be unclean seven days ; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean .
15 : 27 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
16 : 26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward come into the camp .
And he did as the LORD commanded Moses .
17 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 17 : 2 Speak unto Aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them ; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded , saying , 17 : 3 What man soever there be of the house of Israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp , 17 : 4 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD ; blood shall be imputed unto that man ; he hath shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people : 17 : 5 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them unto the LORD , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , unto the priest , and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD .
17 : 7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils , after whom they have gone a whoring .
17 : 11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood : and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls : for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul .
17 : 15 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself , or that which was torn with beasts , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger , he shall both wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even : then shall he be clean .
18 : 11 The nakedness of thy father ' s wife ' s daughter , begotten of thy father , she is thy sister , thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
18 : 17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son ' s daughter , or her daughter ' s daughter , to uncover her nakedness ; for they are her near kinswomen : it is wickedness .
18 : 23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it is confusion .
18 : 24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you : 18 : 25 And the land is defiled : therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it , and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants .
19 : 7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day , it is abominable ; it shall not be accepted .
19 : 18 Thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself : I am the LORD .
19 : 29 Do not prostitute thy daughter , to cause her to be a whore ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
20 : 16 And if a woman approach unto any beast , and lie down thereto , thou shalt kill the woman , and the beast : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
20 : 23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I abhorred them .
20 : 26 And ye shall be holy unto me : for I the LORD am holy , and have severed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
21 : 6 They shall be holy unto their God , and not profane the name of their God : for the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
21 : 14 A widow , or a divorced woman , or profane , or an harlot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife .
22 : 7 And when the sun is down , he shall be clean , and shall afterward eat of the holy things ; because it is his food .
22 : 13 But if the priest ' s daughter be a widow , or divorced , and have no child , and is returned unto her father ' s house , as in her youth , she shall eat of her father ' s meat : but there shall be no stranger eat thereof .
22 : 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 22 : 18 Speak unto Aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them , Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers in Israel , that will offer his oblation for all his vows , and for all his freewill offerings , which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering ; 22 : 19 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish , of the beeves , of the sheep , or of the goats .
22 : 20 But whatsoever hath a blemish , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
22 : 30 On the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow : I am the LORD .
23 : 13 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil , an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour : and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine , the fourth part of an hin .
23 : 14 And ye shall eat neither bread , nor parched corn , nor green ears , until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
23 : 19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering , and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings .
23 : 21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no servile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
23 : 44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD .
24 : 3 Without the vail of the testimony , in the tabernacle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
24 : 17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death .
And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses .
25 : 3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ; 25 : 4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the LORD : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
25 : 5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase : 25 : 21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for three years .
25 : 34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
25 : 39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor , and be sold unto thee ; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant : 25 : 40 But as an hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile .
25 : 51 If there be yet many years behind , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
26 : 1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for I am the LORD your God .
26 : 7 And ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
26 : 30 And I will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols , and my soul shall abhor you .
26 : 34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths , as long as it lieth desolate , and ye be in your enemies ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy her sabbaths .
27 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 27 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When a man shall make a singular vow , the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation .
27 : 8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation , then he shall present himself before the priest , and the priest shall value him ; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him .
27 : 20 And if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more .
1 : 4 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe ; every one head of the house of his fathers .
1 : 11 Of Benjamin ; Abidan the son of Gideoni .
1 : 13 Of Asher ; Pagiel the son of Ocran .
1 : 24 Of the children of Gad , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ; 1 : 25 Those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of Gad , were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty .
1 : 32 Of the children of Joseph , namely , of the children of Ephraim , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ; 1 : 33 Those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of Ephraim , were forty thousand and five hundred .
1 : 42 Of the children of Naphtali , throughout their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ; 1 : 43 Those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of Naphtali , were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
1 : 45 So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ; 1 : 46 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
2 : 7 Then the tribe of Zebulun : and Eliab the son of Helon shall be captain of the children of Zebulun .
2 : 11 And his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were forty and six thousand and five hundred .
They shall go hindmost with their standards .
2 : 32 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers : all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
3 : 5 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 3 : 6 Bring the tribe of Levi near , and present them before Aaron the priest , that they may minister unto him .
3 : 11 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 3 : 12 And I , behold , I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel : therefore the Levites shall be mine ; 3 : 13 Because all the firstborn are mine ; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel , both man and beast : mine shall they be : I am the LORD .
3 : 18 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families ; Libni , and Shimei .
3 : 39 All that were numbered of the Levites , which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD , throughout their families , all the males from a month old and upward , were twenty and two thousand .
3 : 44 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 3 : 45 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel , and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle ; and the Levites shall be mine : I am the LORD .
These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation .
4 : 29 As for the sons of Merari , thou shalt number them after their families , by the house of their fathers ; 4 : 30 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them , every one that entereth into the service , to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation .
4 : 48 Even those that were numbered of them , were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore , 4 : 49 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses , every one according to his service , and according to his burden : thus were they numbered of him , as the LORD commanded Moses .
6 : 10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons , to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : 6 : 11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
6 : 21 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed , and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation , beside that that his hand shall get : according to the vow which he vowed , so he must do after the law of his separation .
7 : 7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon , according to their service : 7 : 8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari , according unto their service , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
7 : 36 On the fifth day Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai , prince of the children of Simeon , did offer : 7 : 37 His offering was one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering : 7 : 38 One golden spoon of ten shekels , full of incense : 7 : 39 One young bullock , one ram , one lamb of the first year , for a burnt offering : 7 : 40 One kid of the goats for a sin offering : 7 : 41 And for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai .
7 : 72 On the eleventh day Pagiel the son of Ocran , prince of the children of Asher , offered : 7 : 73 His offering was one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering : 7 : 74 One golden spoon of ten shekels , full of incense : 7 : 75 One young bullock , one ram , one lamb of the first year , for a burnt offering : 7 : 76 One kid of the goats for a sin offering : 7 : 77 And for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Pagiel the son of Ocran .
7 : 88 And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty and four bullocks , the rams sixty , the he goats sixty , the lambs of the first year sixty .
8 : 14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel : and the Levites shall be mine .
8 : 22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did they unto them .
8 : 23 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 8 : 24 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites : from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation : 8 : 25 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof , and shall serve no more : 8 : 26 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service .
9 : 14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you , and will keep the passover unto the LORD ; according to the ordinance of the passover , and according to the manner thereof , so shall he do : ye shall have one ordinance , both for the stranger , and for him that was born in the land .
9 : 17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
10 : 12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran .
10 : 13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses .
10 : 16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon .
10 : 28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
10 : 36 And when it rested , he said , Return , O LORD , unto the many thousands of Israel .
11 : 1 And when the people complained , it displeased the LORD : and the LORD heard it ; and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them , and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp .
11 : 11 And Moses said unto the LORD , Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant ?
11 : 12 Have I conceived all this people ?
11 : 18 And say thou unto the people , Sanctify yourselves against to morrow , and ye shall eat flesh : for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD , saying , Who shall give us flesh to eat ?
thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not .
11 : 24 And Moses went out , and told the people the words of the LORD , and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them round about the tabernacle .
12 : 5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth .
12 : 14 And the LORD said unto Moses , If her father had but spit in her face , should she not be ashamed seven days ?
12 : 16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth , and pitched in the wilderness of Paran .
13 : 9 Of the tribe of Benjamin , Palti the son of Raphu .
13 : 10 Of the tribe of Zebulun , Gaddiel the son of Sodi .
13 : 11 Of the tribe of Joseph , namely , of the tribe of Manasseh , Gaddi the son of Susi .
13 : 21 So they went up , and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob , as men come to Hamath .
13 : 31 But the men that went up with him said , We be not able to go up against the people ; for they are stronger than we .
14 : 11 And the LORD said unto Moses , How long will this people provoke me ?
14 : 15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying , 14 : 16 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them , therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness .
15 : 11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid .
15 : 32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day .
15 : 36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp , and stoned him with stones , and he died ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
15 : 37 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 15 : 38 Speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue : 15 : 39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandments of the LORD , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a whoring : 15 : 40 That ye may remember , and do all my commandments , and be holy unto your God .
16 : 1 Now Korah , the son of Izhar , the son of Kohath , the son of Levi , and Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , and On , the son of Peleth , sons of Reuben , took men : 16 : 2 And they rose up before Moses , with certain of the children of Israel , two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly , famous in the congregation , men of renown : 16 : 3 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron , and said unto them , Ye take too much upon you , seeing all the congregation are holy , every one of them , and the LORD is among them : wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD ?
16 : 18 And they took every man his censer , and put fire in them , and laid incense thereon , and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron .
16 : 28 And Moses said , Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works ; for I have not done them of mine own mind .
16 : 43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation .
17 : 3 And thou shalt write Aaron ' s name upon the rod of Levi : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers .
17 : 5 And it shall come to pass , that the man ' s rod , whom I shall choose , shall blossom : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmur against you .
17 : 13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die : shall we be consumed with dying ?
18 : 4 And they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
18 : 9 This shall be thine of the most holy things , reserved from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me , shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons .
18 : 15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the LORD , whether it be of men or beasts , shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem .
18 : 18 And the flesh of them shall be thine , as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine .
18 : 27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you , as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
18 : 28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the LORD ' s heave offering to Aaron the priest .
18 : 31 And ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
19 : 8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
19 : 11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days .
19 : 16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
21 : 9 And Moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it came to pass , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he beheld the serpent of brass , he lived .
21 : 12 From thence they removed , and pitched in the valley of Zared .
21 : 16 And from thence they went to Beer : that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses , Gather the people together , and I will give them water .
21 : 25 And Israel took all these cities : and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all the villages thereof .
21 : 26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
22 : 7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
22 : 13 And Balaam rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of Balak , Get you into your land : for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you .
22 : 14 And the princes of Moab rose up , and they went unto Balak , and said , Balaam refuseth to come with us .
22 : 20 And God came unto Balaam at night , and said unto him , If the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
22 : 35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak .
22 : 36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
23 : 5 And the LORD put a word in Balaam ' s mouth , and said , Return unto Balak , and thus thou shalt speak .
or how shall I defy , whom the LORD hath not defied ?
23 : 13 And Balak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence .
23 : 21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob , neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel : the LORD his God is with him , and the shout of a king is among them .
24 : 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes ; and the spirit of God came upon him .
24 : 11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place : I thought to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the LORD hath kept thee back from honour .
24 : 18 And Edom shall be a possession , Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies ; and Israel shall do valiantly .

28 : 15 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .

30 : 3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD , and bind herself by a bond , being in her father ' s house in her youth ; 30 : 4 And her father hear her vow , and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul , and her father shall hold his peace at her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
30 : 9 But every vow of a widow , and of her that is divorced , wherewith they have bound their souls , shall stand against her .
30 : 10 And if she vowed in her husband ' s house , or bound her soul by a bond with an oath ; 30 : 11 And her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and disallowed her not : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
31 : 20 And purify all your raiment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood .
31 : 31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses .
31 : 36 And the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep : 31 : 37 And the LORD ' s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen .
31 : 38 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand ; of which the LORD ' s tribute was threescore and twelve .
31 : 39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred ; of which the LORD ' s tribute was threescore and one .

34 : 10 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham : 34 : 11 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward : 34 : 12 And the border shall go down to Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about .
34 : 22 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan , Bukki the son of Jogli .

35 : 3 And the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
35 : 15 These six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them : that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
35 : 18 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood , wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .

The Fifth Book of Moses : Called Deuteronomy
1 : 1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the Red sea , between Paran , and Tophel , and Laban , and Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
1 : 12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
1 : 17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment ; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man ; for the judgment is God ' s : and the cause that is too hard for you , bring it unto me , and I will hear it .
1 : 18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do .
1 : 21 Behold , the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee : go up and possess it , as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee ; fear not , neither be discouraged .
1 : 37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes , saying , Thou also shalt not go in thither .
1 : 39 Moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war , ye were ready to go up into the hill .
2 : 13 Now rise up , said I , and get you over the brook Zered .
2 : 28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money , that I may eat ; and give me water for money , that I may drink : only I will pass through on my feet ; 2 : 29 ( As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir , and the Moabites which dwell in Ar , did unto me ;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us .
2 : 30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him : for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit , and made his heart obstinate , that he might deliver him into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
nine cubits was the length thereof , and four cubits the breadth of it , after the cubit of a man .
3 : 16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ; 3 : 17 The plain also , and Jordan , and the coast thereof , from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under Ashdothpisgah eastward .
3 : 18 And I commanded you at that time , saying , The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it : ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel , all that are meet for the war .
4 : 7 For what nation is there so great , who hath God so nigh unto them , as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for ?
4 : 12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
4 : 25 When thou shalt beget children , and children ' s children , and ye shall have remained long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselves , and make a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God , to provoke him to anger : 4 : 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it ; ye shall not prolong your days upon it , but shall utterly be destroyed .
4 : 37 And because he loved thy fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt ; 4 : 38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee their land for an inheritance , as it is this day .
5 : 13 Six days thou shalt labour , and do all thy work : 5 : 14 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , nor thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thine ox , nor thine ass , nor any of thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates ; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou .
5 : 20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
5 : 22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he added no more .
And he wrote them in two tables of stone , and delivered them unto me .
5 : 23 And it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , ( for the mountain did burn with fire ,) that ye came near unto me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ; 5 : 24 And ye said , Behold , the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God doth talk with man , and he liveth .
5 : 26 For who is there of all flesh , that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
5 : 32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
7 : 12 Wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers : 7 : 13 And he will love thee , and bless thee , and multiply thee : he will also bless the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy land , thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep , in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee .
8 : 4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee , neither did thy foot swell , these forty years .
9 : 5 Not for thy righteousness , or for the uprightness of thine heart , dost thou go to possess their land : but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee , and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
9 : 26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD , and said , O Lord GOD , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
9 : 27 Remember thy servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin : 9 : 28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say , Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them , and because he hated them , he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness .
10 : 6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest ' s office in his stead .
10 : 8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
10 : 9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren ; the LORD is his inheritance , according as the LORD thy God promised him .
10 : 15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
11 : 8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ; 11 : 9 And that ye may prolong your days in the land , which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
11 : 18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes .
12 : 22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them : the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
12 : 31 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God : for every abomination to the LORD , which he hateth , have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods .
13 : 6 If thy brother , the son of thy mother , or thy son , or thy daughter , or the wife of thy bosom , or thy friend , which is as thine own soul , entice thee secretly , saying , Let us go and serve other gods , which thou hast not known , thou , nor thy fathers ; 13 : 7 Namely , of the gods of the people which are round about you , nigh unto thee , or far off from thee , from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ; 13 : 8 Thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him : 13 : 9 But thou shalt surely kill him ; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
13 : 16 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof , and shalt burn with fire the city , and all the spoil thereof every whit , for the LORD thy God : and it shall be an heap for ever ; it shall not be built again .
14 : 2 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God , and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
15 : 2 And this is the manner of the release : Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the LORD ' s release .
15 : 3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again : but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release ; 15 : 4 Save when there shall be no poor among you ; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it : 15 : 5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day .
16 : 15 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose : because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase , and in all the works of thine hands , therefore thou shalt surely rejoice .
17 : 14 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , I will set a king over me , like as all the nations that are about me ; 17 : 15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the LORD thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
18 : 1 The priests the Levites , and all the tribe of Levi , shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel : they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and his inheritance .
18 : 14 For these nations , which thou shalt possess , hearkened unto observers of times , and unto diviners : but as for thee , the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do .
19 : 3 Thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coasts of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every slayer may flee thither .
19 : 11 But if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these cities : 19 : 12 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
19 : 21 And thine eye shall not pity ; but life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
20 : 7 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ?
20 : 8 And the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted ?
20 : 19 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time , in making war against it to take it , thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them : for thou mayest eat of them , and thou shalt not cut them down ( for the tree of the field is man ' s life ) to employ them in the siege : 20 : 20 Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat , thou shalt destroy and cut them down ; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee , until it be subdued .
21 : 18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them : 21 : 19 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ; 21 : 20 And they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
22 : 20 But if this thing be true , and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel : 22 : 21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father ' s house , and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die : because she hath wrought folly in Israel , to play the whore in her father ' s house : so shalt thou put evil away from among you .
23 : 2 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD .
23 : 22 But if thou shalt forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
24 : 22 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
25 : 17 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way , when ye were come forth out of Egypt ; 25 : 18 How he met thee by the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , even all that were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
26 : 12 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year , which is the year of tithing , and hast given it unto the Levite , the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , that they may eat within thy gates , and be filled ; 26 : 13 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God , I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house , and also have given them unto the Levite , and unto the stranger , to the fatherless , and to the widow , according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me : I have not transgressed thy commandments , neither have I forgotten them .
27 : 4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount Ebal , and thou shalt plaister them with plaister .
27 : 6 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God : 27 : 7 And thou shalt offer peace offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before the LORD thy God .
27 : 10 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .
And all the people shall answer and say , Amen .
28 : 6 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
28 : 11 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy ground , in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee .
28 : 19 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
28 : 30 Thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
28 : 32 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long ; and there shall be no might in thine hand .
28 : 42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume .
28 : 62 And ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God .
29 : 21 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law : 29 : 22 So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you , and the stranger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it ; 29 : 23 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone , and salt , and burning , that it is not sown , nor beareth , nor any grass groweth therein , like the overthrow of Sodom , and Gomorrah , Admah , and Zeboim , which the LORD overthrew in his anger , and in his wrath : 29 : 24 Even all nations shall say , Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land ?
32 : 10 He found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
32 : 22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
33 : 3 Yea , he loved the people ; all his saints are in thy hand : and they sat down at thy feet ; every one shall receive of thy words .
33 : 18 And of Zebulun he said , Rejoice , Zebulun , in thy going out ; and , Issachar , in thy tents .
33 : 28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down dew .
34 : 4 And the LORD said unto him , This is the land which I sware unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , I will give it unto thy seed : I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thither .
Be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
2 : 4 And the woman took the two men , and hid them , and said thus , There came men unto me , but I wist not whence they were : 2 : 5 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went I wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
2 : 14 And the men answered her , Our life for yours , if ye utter not this our business .
2 : 16 And she said unto them , Get you to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers be returned : and afterward may ye go your way .
3 : 11 Behold , the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan .
4 : 10 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan , until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people , according to all that Moses commanded Joshua : and the people hasted and passed over .
5 : 1 And it came to pass , when all the kings of the Amorites , which were on the side of Jordan westward , and all the kings of the Canaanites , which were by the sea , heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel , until we were passed over , that their heart melted , neither was there spirit in them any more , because of the children of Israel .
5 : 2 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua , Make thee sharp knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time .
5 : 9 And the LORD said unto Joshua , This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you .
Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day .
5 : 13 And it came to pass , when Joshua was by Jericho , that he lifted up his eyes and looked , and , behold , there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand : and Joshua went unto him , and said unto him , Art thou for us , or for our adversaries ?
6 : 5 And it shall come to pass , that when they make a long blast with the ram ' s horn , and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet , all the people shall shout with a great shout ; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat , and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him .
6 : 21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword .
6 : 23 And the young men that were spies went in , and brought out Rahab , and her father , and her mother , and her brethren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kindred , and left them without the camp of Israel .
7 : 4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men : and they fled before the men of Ai .
7 : 8 O LORD , what shall I say , when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies !
7 : 10 And the LORD said unto Joshua , Get thee up ; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face ?
7 : 19 And Joshua said unto Achan , My son , give , I pray thee , glory to the LORD God of Israel , and make confession unto him ; and tell me now what thou hast done ; hide it not from me .
So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger .
Wherefore the name of that place was called , The valley of Achor , unto this day .
See , I have commanded you .
8 : 9 Joshua therefore sent them forth : and they went to lie in ambush , and abode between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of Ai : but Joshua lodged that night among the people .
8 : 11 And all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew nigh , and came before the city , and pitched on the north side of Ai : now there was a valley between them and Ai .
8 : 13 And when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
8 : 14 And it came to pass , when the king of Ai saw it , that they hasted and rose up early , and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle , he and all his people , at a time appointed , before the plain ; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city .
8 : 19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
8 : 24 And it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field , in the wilderness wherein they chased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned unto Ai , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
8 : 29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide : and as soon as the sun was down , Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree , and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city , and raise thereon a great heap of stones , that remaineth unto this day .
9 : 3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai , 9 : 4 They did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ; 9 : 5 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet , and old garments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy .
9 : 8 And they said unto Joshua , We are thy servants .
9 : 26 And so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
10 : 3 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem , sent unto Hoham king of Hebron , and unto Piram king of Jarmuth , and unto Japhia king of Lachish , and unto Debir king of Eglon , saying , 10 : 4 Come up unto me , and help me , that we may smite Gibeon : for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel .
10 : 6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal , saying , Slack not thy hand from thy servants ; come up to us quickly , and save us , and help us : for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us .
10 : 9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly , and went up from Gilgal all night .
10 : 12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel , and he said in the sight of Israel , Sun , stand thou still upon Gibeon ; and thou , Moon , in the valley of Ajalon .
10 : 17 And it was told Joshua , saying , The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah .
10 : 23 And they did so , and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
10 : 28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroyed , them , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho .
10 : 33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish ; and Joshua smote him and his people , until he had left him none remaining .
13 : 22 Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them .
This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
13 : 32 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab , on the other side Jordan , by Jericho , eastward .
14 : 2 By lot was their inheritance , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half tribe .
14 : 6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal : and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him , Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea .
14 : 7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan : 15 : 6 And the border went up to Bethhogla , and passed along by the north of Betharabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben : 15 : 7 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is before the going up to Adummim , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh , and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel : 15 : 8 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite ; the same is Jerusalem : and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward , which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward : 15 : 9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjathjearim : 15 : 10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Bethshemesh , and passed on to Timnah : 15 : 11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
15 : 15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher .

17 : 11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns , and Ibleam and her towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns , even three countries .
18 : 1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh , and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there .
And the land was subdued before them .
18 : 13 And the border went over from thence toward Luz , to the side of Luz , which is Bethel , southward ; and the border descended to Atarothadar , near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Bethhoron .
18 : 21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , and Bethhoglah , and the valley of Keziz , 18 : 22 And Betharabah , and Zemaraim , and Bethel , 18 : 23 And Avim , and Pharah , and Ophrah , 18 : 24 And Chepharhaammonai , and Ophni , and Gaba ; twelve cities with their villages : 18 : 25 Gibeon , and Ramah , and Beeroth , 18 : 26 And Mizpeh , and Chephirah , and Mozah , 18 : 27 And Rekem , and Irpeel , and Taralah , 18 : 28 And Zelah , Eleph , and Jebusi , which is Jerusalem , Gibeath , and Kirjath ; fourteen cities with their villages .
19 : 1 And the second lot came forth to Simeon , even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families : and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah .
19 : 25 And their border was Helkath , and Hali , and Beten , and Achshaph , 19 : 26 And Alammelech , and Amad , and Misheal ; and reacheth to Carmel westward , and to Shihorlibnath ; 19 : 27 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon , and reacheth to Zebulun , and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek , and Neiel , and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand , 19 : 28 And Hebron , and Rehob , and Hammon , and Kanah , even unto great Zidon ; 19 : 29 And then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib : 19 : 30 Ummah also , and Aphek , and Rehob : twenty and two cities with their villages .
19 : 33 And their coast was from Heleph , from Allon to Zaanannim , and Adami , Nekeb , and Jabneel , unto Lakum ; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan : 19 : 34 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor , and goeth out from thence to Hukkok , and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side , and reacheth to Asher on the west side , and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising .
19 : 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families , the cities and their villages .
19 : 40 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families .
19 : 47 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them : therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem , and took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and possessed it , and dwelt therein , and called Leshem , Dan , after the name of Dan their father .
20 : 7 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali , and Shechem in mount Ephraim , and Kirjatharba , which is Hebron , in the mountain of Judah .
21 : 8 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
21 : 36 And out of the tribe of Reuben , Bezer with her suburbs , and Jahazah with her suburbs , 21 : 37 Kedemoth with her suburbs , and Mephaath with her suburbs ; four cities .
21 : 38 And out of the tribe of Gad , Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Mahanaim with her suburbs , 21 : 39 Heshbon with her suburbs , Jazer with her suburbs ; four cities in all .
21 : 42 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them : thus were all these cities .
22 : 1 Then Joshua called the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh , 22 : 2 And said unto them , Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you : 22 : 3 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God .
22 : 13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , 22 : 14 And with him ten princes , of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel ; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel .
22 : 17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD , 22 : 18 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD ?
23 : 5 And the LORD your God , he shall expel them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the LORD your God hath promised unto you .
23 : 6 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left ; 23 : 7 That ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them : 23 : 8 But cleave unto the LORD your God , as ye have done unto this day .
23 : 9 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
23 : 11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves , that ye love the LORD your God .
24 : 7 And when they cried unto the LORD , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them ; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt : and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season .
24 : 14 Now therefore fear the LORD , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the LORD .
24 : 15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD , choose you this day whom ye will serve ; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood , or the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but as for me and my house , we will serve the LORD .
24 : 19 And Joshua said unto the people , Ye cannot serve the LORD : for he is an holy God ; he is a jealous God ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
And they said , We are witnesses .
24 : 24 And the people said unto Joshua , The LORD our God will we serve , and his voice will we obey .
24 : 27 And Joshua said unto all the people , Behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us ; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your God .
1 : 1 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass , that the children of Israel asked the LORD , saying , Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first , to fight against them ?
1 : 8 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem , and had taken it , and smitten it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
1 : 10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron : ( now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba :) and they slew Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
1 : 14 And it came to pass , when she came to him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field : and she lighted from off her ass ; and Caleb said unto her , What wilt thou ?
And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs .
1 : 16 And the children of the Kenite , Moses ' father in law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah , which lieth in the south of Arad ; and they went and dwelt among the people .
1 : 22 And the house of Joseph , they also went up against Bethel : and the LORD was with them .
1 : 24 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said unto him , Shew us , we pray thee , the entrance into the city , and we will shew thee mercy .
2 : 5 And they called the name of that place Bochim : and they sacrificed there unto the LORD .
2 : 15 Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the LORD was against them for evil , as the LORD had said , and as the LORD had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
2 : 18 And when the LORD raised them up judges , then the LORD was with the judge , and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them .
3 : 14 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years .
3 : 15 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised them up a deliverer , Ehud the son of Gera , a Benjamite , a man lefthanded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab .
And all that stood by him went out from him .
3 : 21 And Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly : 3 : 22 And the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
And they went down after him , and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab , and suffered not a man to pass over .
4 : 9 And she said , I will surely go with thee : notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour ; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman .
And Deborah arose , and went with Barak to Kedesh .
5 : 1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day , saying , 5 : 2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel , when the people willingly offered themselves .
5 : 3 Hear , O ye kings ; give ear , O ye princes ; I , even I , will sing unto the LORD ; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel .
5 : 5 The mountains melted from before the LORD , even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel .
5 : 8 They chose new gods ; then was war in the gates : was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel ?
Asher continued on the sea shore , and abode in his breaches .
why tarry the wheels of his chariots ?
and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of , saying , Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt ?
behold , my family is poor in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father ' s house .
6 : 16 And the LORD said unto him , Surely I will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man .
6 : 21 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand , and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes ; and there rose up fire out of the rock , and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes .
Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight .
6 : 25 And it came to pass the same night , that the LORD said unto him , Take thy father ' s young bullock , even the second bullock of seven years old , and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath , and cut down the grove that is by it : 6 : 26 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
6 : 28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was cast down , and the grove was cut down that was by it , and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built .
6 : 32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal , saying , Let Baal plead against him , because he hath thrown down his altar .
6 : 33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and pitched in the valley of Jezreel .
6 : 35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; who also was gathered after him : and he sent messengers unto Asher , and unto Zebulun , and unto Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
7 : 2 And the LORD said unto Gideon , The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands , lest Israel vaunt themselves against me , saying , Mine own hand hath saved me .
7 : 4 And the LORD said unto Gideon , The people are yet too many ; bring them down unto the water , and I will try them for thee there : and it shall be , that of whom I say unto thee , This shall go with thee , the same shall go with thee ; and of whomsoever I say unto thee , This shall not go with thee , the same shall not go .
7 : 17 And he said unto them , Look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
7 : 18 When I blow with a trumpet , I and all that are with me , then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp , and say , The sword of the LORD , and of Gideon .
7 : 20 And the three companies blew the trumpets , and brake the pitchers , and held the lamps in their left hands , and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal : and they cried , The sword of the LORD , and of Gideon .
Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together , and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan .
8 : 1 And the men of Ephraim said unto him , Why hast thou served us thus , that thou calledst us not , when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites ?
8 : 19 And he said , They were my brethren , even the sons of my mother : as the LORD liveth , if ye had saved them alive , I would not slay you .
( For they had golden earrings , because they were Ishmaelites .)
9 : 4 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith , wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons , which followed him .
9 : 14 Then said all the trees unto the bramble , Come thou , and reign over us .
9 : 16 Now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands ; 9 : 17 ( For my father fought for you , and adventured his life far , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian : 9 : 18 And ye are risen up against my father ' s house this day , and have slain his sons , threescore and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ;) 9 : 19 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice ye in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you : 9 : 20 But if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem , and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech .
9 : 21 And Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and dwelt there , for fear of Abimelech his brother .
9 : 38 Then said Zebul unto him , Where is now thy mouth , wherewith thou saidst , Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ?
go out , I pray now , and fight with them .
10 : 2 And he judged Israel twenty and three years , and died , and was buried in Shamir .
10 : 11 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel , Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
10 : 14 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen ; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation .
10 : 17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead .
and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress ?
11 : 11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and captain over them : and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh .
11 : 12 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon , saying , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me to fight in my land ?
11 : 20 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and pitched in Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
11 : 34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house , and , behold , his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances : and she was his only child ; beside her he had neither son nor daughter .
thou hast brought me very low , and thou art one of them that trouble me : for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD , and I cannot go back .
11 : 37 And she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows .
And it was a custom in Israel , 11 : 40 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year .
Then died Jephthah the Gileadite , and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead .
And he judged Israel seven years .
12 : 10 Then died Ibzan , and was buried at Bethlehem .
12 : 11 And after him Elon , a Zebulonite , judged Israel ; and he judged Israel ten years .
12 : 14 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews , that rode on threescore and ten ass colts : and he judged Israel eight years .
13 : 13 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah , Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware .
And Manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
13 : 24 And the woman bare a son , and called his name Samson : and the child grew , and the LORD blessed him .
14 : 7 And he went down , and talked with the woman ; and she pleased Samson well .
15 : 7 And Samson said unto them , Though ye have done this , yet will I be avenged of you , and after that I will cease .
15 : 8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam .
15 : 10 And the men of Judah said , Why are ye come up against us ?
16 : 4 And it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
16 : 5 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her , and said unto her , Entice him , and see wherein his great strength lieth , and by what means we may prevail against him , that we may bind him to afflict him ; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver .
And he brake the withs , as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire .
And he brake them from off his arms like a thread .
And he awaked out of his sleep , and went away with the pin of the beam , and with the web .
thou hast mocked me these three times , and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth .
16 : 19 And she made him sleep upon her knees ; and she called for a man , and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to afflict him , and his strength went from him .
And they called for Samson out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pillars .
So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life .
17 : 1 And there was a man of mount Ephraim , whose name was Micah .
17 : 5 And the man Micah had an house of gods , and made an ephod , and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
17 : 8 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place : and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he journeyed .
17 : 9 And Micah said unto him , Whence comest thou ?
So the Levite went in .
17 : 13 Then said Micah , Now know I that the LORD will do me good , seeing I have a Levite to my priest .
18 : 7 Then the five men departed , and came to Laish , and saw the people that were therein , how they dwelt careless , after the manner of the Zidonians , quiet and secure ; and there was no magistrate in the land , that might put them to shame in any thing ; and they were far from the Zidonians , and had no business with any man .
18 : 12 And they went up , and pitched in Kirjathjearim , in Judah : wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day : behold , it is behind Kirjathjearim .
now therefore consider what ye have to do .
18 : 19 And they said unto him , Hold thy peace , lay thine hand upon thy mouth , and go with us , and be to us a father and a priest : is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man , or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel ?
18 : 22 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men that were in the houses near to Micah ' s house were gathered together , and overtook the children of Dan .
and what is this that ye say unto me , What aileth thee ?
18 : 28 And there was no deliverer , because it was far from Zidon , and they had no business with any man ; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob .
19 : 6 And they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the damsel ' s father had said unto the man , Be content , I pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry .
19 : 17 And when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man said , Whither goest thou ?
19 : 28 And he said unto her , Up , and let us be going .
20 : 7 Behold , ye are all children of Israel ; give here your advice and counsel .
20 : 24 And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day .
20 : 25 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
20 : 38 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait , that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city .
20 : 45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon : and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men ; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom , and slew two thousand men of them .
21 : 9 For the people were numbered , and , behold , there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there .
21 : 14 And Benjamin came again at that time ; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead : and yet so they sufficed them not .
21 : 25 In those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
1 : 9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband .
1 : 20 And she said unto them , Call me not Naomi , call me Mara : for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me .
2 : 3 And she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
Go not to glean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by my maidens : 2 : 9 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap , and go thou after them : have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee ?
2 : 10 Then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
2 : 18 And she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
and where wroughtest thou ?
blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee .
3 : 10 And he said , Blessed be thou of the LORD , my daughter : for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning , inasmuch as thou followedst not young men , whether poor or rich .
3 : 14 And she lay at his feet until the morning : and she rose up before one could know another .
And they sat down .
4 : 11 And all the people that were in the gate , and the elders , said , We are witnesses .
4 : 15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life , and a nourisher of thine old age : for thy daughter in law , which loveth thee , which is better to thee than seven sons , hath born him .
1 : 7 And as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the LORD , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and did not eat .
and why eatest thou not ?
1 : 11 And she vowed a vow , and said , O LORD of hosts , if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid , and remember me , and not forget thine handmaid , but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child , then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life , and there shall no razor come upon his head .
So the woman went her way , and did eat , and her countenance was no more sad .
1 : 20 Wherefore it came to pass , when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived , that she bare a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Because I have asked him of the LORD .
1 : 26 And she said , Oh my lord , as thy soul liveth , my lord , I am the woman that stood by thee here , praying unto the LORD .
1 : 27 For this child I prayed ; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him : 1 : 28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD ; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD .
And he worshipped the LORD there .
2 : 2 There is none holy as the LORD : for there is none beside thee : neither is there any rock like our God .
2 : 12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial ; they knew not the LORD .
And the child Samuel grew before the LORD .
2 : 31 Behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father ' s house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
3 : 2 And it came to pass at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wax dim , that he could not see ; 3 : 3 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD , where the ark of God was , and Samuel was laid down to sleep ; 3 : 4 That the LORD called Samuel : and he answered , Here am I .
And Samuel arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou didst call me .
And he answered , I called not , my son ; lie down again .
And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child .
Then Samuel answered , Speak ; for thy servant heareth .
3 : 14 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli , that the iniquity of Eli ' s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever .
3 : 15 And Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the LORD .
And he answered , Here am I .
I pray thee hide it not from me : God do so to thee , and more also , if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee .
3 : 20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD .
who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods ?
But she answered not , neither did she regard it .
5 : 7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us : for his hand is sore upon us , and upon Dagon our god .
And it came to pass , as the ark of God came to Ekron , that the Ekronites cried out , saying , They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us , to slay us and our people .
5 : 11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines , and said , Send away the ark of the God of Israel , and let it go again to his own place , that it slay us not , and our people : for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city ; the hand of God was very heavy there .
5 : 12 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods : and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
6 : 17 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD ; for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Askelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ; 6 : 18 And the golden mice , according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords , both of fenced cities , and of country villages , even unto the great stone of Abel , whereon they set down the ark of the LORD : which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua , the Bethshemite .
and to whom shall he go up from us ?
7 : 1 And the men of Kirjathjearim came , and fetched up the ark of the LORD , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD .
8 : 8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
8 : 10 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king .
8 : 22 And the LORD said to Samuel , Hearken unto their voice , and make them a king .
9 : 4 And he passed through mount Ephraim , and passed through the land of Shalisha , but they found them not : then they passed through the land of Shalim , and there they were not : and he passed through the land of the Benjamites , but they found them not .
for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God : what have we ?
9 : 9 ( Beforetime in Israel , when a man went to enquire of God , thus he spake , Come , and let us go to the seer : for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer .)
9 : 23 And Samuel said unto the cook , Bring the portion which I gave thee , of which I said unto thee , Set it by thee .
9 : 24 And the cook took up the shoulder , and that which was upon it , and set it before Saul .
10 : 1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil , and poured it upon his head , and kissed him , and said , Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance ?
10 : 3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor , and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel , one carrying three kids , and another carrying three loaves of bread , and another carrying a bottle of wine : 10 : 4 And they will salute thee , and give thee two loaves of bread ; which thou shalt receive of their hands .
10 : 10 And when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophesied among them .
10 : 11 And it came to pass , when all that knew him beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come unto the son of Kish ?
Therefore it became a proverb , Is Saul also among the prophets ?
10 : 15 And Saul ' s uncle said , Tell me , I pray thee , what Samuel said unto you .
10 : 17 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh ; 10 : 18 And said unto the children of Israel , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I brought up Israel out of Egypt , and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all kingdoms , and of them that oppressed you : 10 : 19 And ye have this day rejected your God , who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations ; and ye have said unto him , Nay , but set a king over us .
10 : 21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was taken , and Saul the son of Kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
And all the people shouted , and said , God save the king .
And they despised him , and brought no presents .
But he held his peace .
12 : 2 And now , behold , the king walketh before you : and I am old and grayheaded ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
12 : 7 Now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD , which he did to you and to your fathers .
12 : 19 And all the people said unto Samuel , Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God , that we die not : for we have added unto all our sins this evil , to ask us a king .
12 : 25 But if ye shall still do wickedly , ye shall be consumed , both ye and your king .
As for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
13 : 13 And Samuel said to Saul , Thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God , which he commanded thee : for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever .
13 : 14 But now thy kingdom shall not continue : the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart , and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people , because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee .
13 : 16 And Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people that were present with them , abode in Gibeah of Benjamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
13 : 17 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah , unto the land of Shual : 13 : 18 And another company turned the way to Bethhoron : and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness .
14 : 6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour , Come , and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised : it may be that the LORD will work for us : for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few .
14 : 10 But if they say thus , Come up unto us ; then we will go up : for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand : and this shall be a sign unto us .
14 : 18 And Saul said unto Ahiah , Bring hither the ark of God .
14 : 21 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
And the people were faint .
14 : 35 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD : the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD .
Then said the priest , Let us draw near hither unto God .
14 : 38 And Saul said , Draw ye near hither , all the chief of the people : and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day .
14 : 41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel , Give a perfect lot .
14 : 47 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel , and fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and whithersoever he turned himself , he vexed them .
14 : 51 And Kish was the father of Saul ; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel .
14 : 52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any strong man , or any valiant man , he took him unto him .
15 : 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , I remember that which Amalek did to Israel , how he laid wait for him in the way , when he came up from Egypt .
15 : 3 Now go and smite Amalek , and utterly destroy all that they have , and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
15 : 7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur , that is over against Egypt .
Behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of rams .
15 : 23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry .
15 : 33 And Samuel said , As the sword hath made women childless , so shall thy mother be childless among women .
16 : 1 And the LORD said unto Samuel , How long wilt thou mourn for Saul , seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel ?
16 : 2 And Samuel said , How can I go ?
16 : 4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake , and came to Bethlehem .
16 : 8 Then Jesse called Abinadab , and made him pass before Samuel .
And Samuel said unto Jesse , Send and fetch him : for we will not sit down till he come hither .
16 : 16 Let our lord now command thy servants , which are before thee , to seek out a man , who is a cunning player on an harp : and it shall come to pass , when the evil spirit from God is upon thee , that he shall play with his hand , and thou shalt be well .
16 : 23 And it came to pass , when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul , that David took an harp , and played with his hand : so Saul was refreshed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
17 : 9 If he be able to fight with me , and to kill me , then will we be your servants : but if I prevail against him , and kill him , then shall ye be our servants , and serve us .
for who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ?
17 : 28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men ; and Eliab ' s anger was kindled against David , and he said , Why camest thou down hither ?
17 : 30 And he turned from him toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
17 : 39 And David girded his sword upon his armour , and he assayed to go ; for he had not proved it .
And David said unto Saul , I cannot go with these ; for I have not proved them .
17 : 44 And the Philistine said to David , Come to me , and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air , and to the beasts of the field .
17 : 45 Then said David to the Philistine , Thou comest to me with a sword , and with a spear , and with a shield : but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts , the God of the armies of Israel , whom thou hast defied .
17 : 47 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear : for the battle is the LORD ' s , and he will give you into our hands .
17 : 48 And it came to pass , when the Philistine arose , and came , and drew nigh to meet David , that David hastened , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
17 : 53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines , and they spoiled their tents .
17 : 58 And Saul said to him , Whose son art thou , thou young man ?
And David answered , I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite .
18 : 1 And it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul .
18 : 2 And Saul took him that day , and would let him go no more home to his father ' s house .
18 : 5 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him , and behaved himself wisely : and Saul set him over the men of war , and he was accepted in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of Saul ' s servants .
18 : 20 And Michal Saul ' s daughter loved David : and they told Saul , and the thing pleased him .
18 : 24 And the servants of Saul told him , saying , On this manner spake David .
18 : 30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was much set by .
19 : 1 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son , and to all his servants , that they should kill David .
19 : 2 But Jonathan Saul ' s son delighted much in David : and Jonathan told David , saying , Saul my father seeketh to kill thee : now therefore , I pray thee , take heed to thyself until the morning , and abide in a secret place , and hide thyself : 19 : 3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commune with my father of thee ; and what I see , that I will tell thee .
19 : 10 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin : but he slipped away out of Saul ' s presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
19 : 11 Saul also sent messengers unto David ' s house , to watch him , and to slay him in the morning : and Michal David ' s wife told him , saying , If thou save not thy life to night , to morrow thou shalt be slain .
19 : 12 So Michal let David down through a window : and he went , and fled , and escaped .
19 : 17 And Saul said unto Michal , Why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ?
And one said , Behold , they be at Naioth in Ramah .
19 : 24 And he stripped off his clothes also , and prophesied before Samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night .
20 : 8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant ; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee : notwithstanding , if there be in me iniquity , slay me thyself ; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father ?
20 : 18 Then Jonathan said to David , To morrow is the new moon : and thou shalt be missed , because thy seat will be empty .
20 : 31 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground , thou shalt not be established , nor thy kingdom .
20 : 37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the lad , and said , Is not the arrow beyond thee ?
20 : 38 And Jonathan cried after the lad , Make speed , haste , stay not .
And he arose and departed : and Jonathan went into the city .
21 : 5 And David answered the priest , and said unto him , Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days , since I came out , and the vessels of the young men are holy , and the bread is in a manner common , yea , though it were sanctified this day in the vessel .
21 : 15 Have I need of mad men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ?
22 : 4 And he brought them before the king of Moab : and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold .
And he answered , Here I am , my lord .
22 : 20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped , and fled after David .
23 : 1 Then they told David , saying , Behold , the Philistines fight against Keilah , and they rob the threshingfloors .
23 : 2 Therefore David enquired of the LORD , saying , Shall I go and smite these Philistines ?
So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
23 : 13 Then David and his men , which were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went whithersoever they could go .
23 : 16 And Jonathan Saul ' s son arose , and went to David into the wood , and strengthened his hand in God .
23 : 27 But there came a messenger unto Saul , saying , Haste thee , and come ; for the Philistines have invaded the land .
24 : 2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats .
24 : 3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way , where was a cave ; and Saul went in to cover his feet : and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave .
24 : 7 So David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul .
24 : 9 And David said to Saul , Wherefore hearest thou men ' s words , saying , Behold , David seeketh thy hurt ?
24 : 13 As saith the proverb of the ancients , Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day .
24 : 21 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father ' s house .
And David arose , and went down to the wilderness of Paran .
Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes : for we come in a good day : give , I pray thee , whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants , and to thy son David .
25 : 23 And when Abigail saw David , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , 25 : 24 And fell at his feet , and said , Upon me , my lord , upon me let this iniquity be : and let thine handmaid , I pray thee , speak in thine audience , and hear the words of thine handmaid .
25 : 26 Now therefore , my lord , as the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood , and from avenging thyself with thine own hand , now let thine enemies , and they that seek evil to my lord , be as Nabal .
25 : 27 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord , let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord .
25 : 29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee , and to seek thy soul : but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God ; and the souls of thine enemies , them shall he sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
25 : 40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel , they spake unto her , saying , David sent us unto thee , to take thee to him to wife .
25 : 41 And she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , Behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
26 : 13 Then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of an hill afar off ; a great space being between them : 26 : 14 And David cried to the people , and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , Answerest thou not , Abner ?
26 : 17 And Saul knew David ' s voice , and said , Is this thy voice , my son David ?
And David said , It is my voice , my lord , O king .
26 : 19 Now therefore , I pray thee , let my lord the king hear the words of his servant .
26 : 25 Then Saul said to David , Blessed be thou , my son David : thou shalt both do great things , and also shalt still prevail .
So David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place .
27 : 5 And David said unto Achish , If I have now found grace in thine eyes , let them give me a place in some town in the country , that I may dwell there : for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee ?
27 : 6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day : wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day .
And David said , Against the south of Judah , and against the south of the Jerahmeelites , and against the south of the Kenites .
28 : 4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together , and came and pitched in Shunem : and Saul gathered all Israel together , and they pitched in Gilboa .
And he said , Bring me up Samuel .
28 : 14 And he said unto her , What form is he of ?
And Saul perceived that it was Samuel , and he stooped with his face to the ground , and bowed himself .
28 : 15 And Samuel said to Saul , Why hast thou disquieted me , to bring me up ?
And Saul answered , I am sore distressed ; for the Philistines make war against me , and God is departed from me , and answereth me no more , neither by prophets , nor by dreams : therefore I have called thee , that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do .
28 : 21 And the woman came unto Saul , and saw that he was sore troubled , and said unto him , Behold , thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me .
29 : 4 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him ; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him , Make this fellow return , that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him , and let him not go down with us to battle , lest in the battle he be an adversary to us : for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master ?
29 : 6 Then Achish called David , and said unto him , Surely , as the LORD liveth , thou hast been upright , and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight : for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day : nevertheless the lords favour thee not .
And the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
30 : 4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David .
And he said , I am a young man of Egypt , servant to an Amalekite ; and my master left me , because three days agone I fell sick .
30 : 18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away : and David rescued his two wives .
30 : 20 And David took all the flocks and the herds , which they drave before those other cattle , and said , This is David ' s spoil .
31 : 4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through , and abuse me .
31 : 8 And it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
31 : 10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth : and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan .
31 : 11 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul ; 31 : 12 All the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan , and came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
1 : 3 And David said unto him , From whence comest thou ?
1 : 7 And when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called unto me .
1 : 11 Then David took hold on his clothes , and rent them ; and likewise all the men that were with him : 1 : 12 And they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the LORD , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
And he answered , I am the son of a stranger , an Amalekite .
2 : 2 So David went up thither , and his two wives also , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail Nabal ' s wife the Carmelite .
And they told David , saying , That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul .
2 : 5 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead , and said unto them , Blessed be ye of the LORD , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
2 : 11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months .
2 : 12 And Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
And he answered , I am .
2 : 21 And Abner said to him , Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left , and lay thee hold on one of the young men , and take thee his armour .
2 : 25 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one troop , and stood on the top of an hill .
knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end ?
2 : 27 And Joab said , As God liveth , unless thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
2 : 31 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin , and of Abner ' s men , so that three hundred and threescore men died .
And Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
3 : 2 And unto David were sons born in Hebron : and his firstborn was Amnon , of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess ; 3 : 3 And his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ; 3 : 4 And the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ; 3 : 5 And the sixth , Ithream , by Eglah David ' s wife .
3 : 13 And he said , Well ; I will make a league with thee : but one thing I require of thee , that is , Thou shalt not see my face , except thou first bring Michal Saul ' s daughter , when thou comest to see my face .
And he returned .
3 : 19 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
3 : 24 Then Joab came to the king , and said , What hast thou done ?
3 : 35 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day , David sware , saying , So do God to me , and more also , if I taste bread , or ought else , till the sun be down .
4 : 5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
But they took the head of Ishbosheth , and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron .
5 : 2 Also in time past , when Saul was king over us , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the LORD said to thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be a captain over Israel .
5 : 7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion : the same is the city of David .
And the LORD said unto David , Go up : for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand .
5 : 22 And the Philistines came up yet again , and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
6 : 2 And David arose , and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah , to bring up from thence the ark of God , whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims .
6 : 5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood , even on harps , and on psalteries , and on timbrels , and on cornets , and on cymbals .
6 : 11 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months : and the LORD blessed Obededom , and all his household .
6 : 17 And they brought in the ark of the LORD , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it : and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
6 : 22 And I will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
7 : 10 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in a place of their own , and move no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more , as beforetime , 7 : 11 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel , and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies .
If he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men : 7 : 15 But my mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
8 : 1 And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines , and subdued them : and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines .
8 : 3 David smote also Hadadezer , the son of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates .
8 : 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus : and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought gifts .
8 : 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went .
9 : 2 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba .
9 : 3 And the king said , Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may shew the kindness of God unto him ?
9 : 4 And the king said unto him , Where is he ?
And David said , Mephibosheth .
9 : 8 And he bowed himself , and said , What is thy servant , that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am ?
9 : 9 Then the king called to Ziba , Saul ' s servant , and said unto him , I have given unto thy master ' s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house .
As for Mephibosheth , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king ' s sons .
And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth .
10 : 1 And it came to pass after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his son reigned in his stead .
10 : 9 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians : 10 : 10 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon .
10 : 11 And he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
10 : 14 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Abishai , and entered into the city .
So Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
And Uriah departed out of the king ' s house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
11 : 10 And when they had told David , saying , Uriah went not down unto his house , David said unto Uriah , Camest thou not from thy journey ?
11 : 18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war ; 11 : 19 And charged the messenger , saying , When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king , 11 : 20 And if so be that the king ' s wrath arise , and he say unto thee , Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight ?
knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
11 : 21 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth ?
12 : 10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house ; because thou hast despised me , and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife .
And they said , He is dead .
12 : 21 Then said his servants unto him , What thing is this that thou hast done ?
12 : 25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet ; and he called his name Jedidiah , because of the LORD .
12 : 26 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and took the royal city .
12 : 27 And Joab sent messengers to David , and said , I have fought against Rabbah , and have taken the city of waters .
And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem .
13 : 2 And Amnon was so vexed , that he fell sick for his sister Tamar ; for she was a virgin ; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her .
And they went out every man from him .
13 : 10 And Amnon said unto Tamar , Bring the meat into the chamber , that I may eat of thine hand .
And Amnon said unto her , Arise , be gone .
13 : 18 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king ' s daughters that were virgins apparelled .
13 : 26 Then said Absalom , If not , I pray thee , let my brother Amnon go with us .
13 : 28 Now Absalom had commanded his servants , saying , Mark ye now when Amnon ' s heart is merry with wine , and when I say unto you , Smite Amnon ; then kill him , fear not : have not I commanded you ?
Then all the king ' s sons arose , and every man gat him up upon his mule , and fled .
13 : 32 And Jonadab , the son of Shimeah David ' s brother , answered and said , Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king ' s sons ; for Amnon only is dead : for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar .
13 : 35 And Jonadab said unto the king , Behold , the king ' s sons come : as thy servant said , so it is .
13 : 36 And it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that , behold , the king ' s sons came , and lifted up their voice and wept : and the king also and all his servants wept very sore .
13 : 38 So Absalom fled , and went to Geshur , and was there three years .
14 : 4 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obeisance , and said , Help , O king .
And she answered , I am indeed a widow woman , and mine husband is dead .
And he said , As the LORD liveth , there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth .
14 : 13 And the woman said , Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God ?
14 : 16 For the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
And the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
14 : 23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur , and brought Absalom to Jerusalem .
14 : 26 And when he polled his head , ( for it was at every year ' s end that he polled it : because the hair was heavy on him , therefore he polled it :) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king ' s weight .
14 : 30 Therefore he said unto his servants , See , Joab ' s field is near mine , and he hath barley there ; go and set it on fire .
14 : 32 And Absalom answered Joab , Behold , I sent unto thee , saying , Come hither , that I may send thee to the king , to say , Wherefore am I come from Geshur ?
it had been good for me to have been there still : now therefore let me see the king ' s face ; and if there be any iniquity in me , let him kill me .
15 : 11 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem , that were called ; and they went in their simplicity , and they knew not any thing .
15 : 14 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem , Arise , and let us flee ; for we shall not else escape from Absalom : make speed to depart , lest he overtake us suddenly , and bring evil upon us , and smite the city with the edge of the sword .
15 : 15 And the king ' s servants said unto the king , Behold , thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint .
15 : 18 And all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men which came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
15 : 31 And one told David , saying , Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom .
therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king ' s house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
15 : 36 Behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok ' s son , and Jonathan Abiathar ' s son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
16 : 3 And the king said , And where is thy master ' s son ?
16 : 5 And when king David came to Bahurim , behold , thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera : he came forth , and cursed still as he came .
16 : 19 And again , whom should I serve ?
should I not serve in the presence of his son ?
16 : 21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom , Go in unto thy father ' s concubines , which he hath left to keep the house ; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father : then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong .
16 : 23 And the counsel of Ahithophel , which he counselled in those days , was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God : so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom .
17 : 7 And Hushai said unto Absalom , The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time .
And when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
17 : 26 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead .
17 : 27 And it came to pass , when David was come to Mahanaim , that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar , and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim , 17 : 28 Brought beds , and basons , and earthen vessels , and wheat , and barley , and flour , and parched corn , and beans , and lentiles , and parched pulse , 17 : 29 And honey , and butter , and sheep , and cheese of kine , for David , and for the people that were with him , to eat : for they said , The people is hungry , and weary , and thirsty , in the wilderness .
And the king said unto the people , I will surely go forth with you myself also .
and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver , and a girdle .
18 : 19 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok , Let me now run , and bear the king tidings , how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies .
18 : 21 Then said Joab to Cushi , Go tell the king what thou hast seen .
Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain , and overran Cushi .
And the king said , If he be alone , there is tidings in his mouth .
And Cushi answered , The enemies of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt , be as that young man is .
19 : 1 And it was told Joab , Behold , the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom .
19 : 10 And Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle .
Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back ?
19 : 11 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , saying , Speak unto the elders of Judah , saying , Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house ?
19 : 14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as the heart of one man ; so that they sent this word unto the king , Return thou , and all thy servants .
19 : 15 So the king returned , and came to Jordan .
19 : 17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
19 : 30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king , Yea , let him take all , forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house .
19 : 31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim , and went over Jordan with the king , to conduct him over Jordan .
19 : 32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man , even fourscore years old : and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
19 : 35 I am this day fourscore years old : and can I discern between good and evil ?
19 : 37 Let thy servant , I pray thee , turn back again , that I may die in mine own city , and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother .
19 : 38 And the king answered , Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will I do for thee .
19 : 39 And all the people went over Jordan .
19 : 40 Then the king went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him : and all the people of Judah conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
20 : 5 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah : but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri .
20 : 14 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel , and to Bethmaachah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
And he answered , I am he .
20 : 19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel : thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel : why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD ?
21 : 5 And they answered the king , The man that consumed us , and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel , 21 : 6 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul , whom the LORD did choose .
And the king said , I will give them .
21 : 18 And it came to pass after this , that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob : then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph , which was of the sons of the giant .
22 : 17 He sent from above , he took me ; he drew me out of many waters ; 22 : 18 He delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated me : for they were too strong for me .
22 : 21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
22 : 22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
22 : 23 For all his judgments were before me : and as for his statutes , I did not depart from them .
22 : 29 For thou art my lamp , O LORD : and the LORD will lighten my darkness .
and who is a rock , save our God ?
22 : 45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me : as soon as they hear , they shall be obedient unto me .
22 : 49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
23 : 1 Now these be the last words of David .
23 : 5 Although my house be not so with God ; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant , ordered in all things , and sure : for this is all my salvation , and all my desire , although he make it not to grow .
23 : 11 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite .
23 : 17 And he said , Be it far from me , O LORD , that I should do this : is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives ?
therefore he was their captain : howbeit he attained not unto the first three .
And David set him over his guard .
23 : 24 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty ; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem , 23 : 25 Shammah the Harodite , Elika the Harodite , 23 : 26 Helez the Paltite , Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite , 23 : 27 Abiezer the Anethothite , Mebunnai the Hushathite , 23 : 28 Zalmon the Ahohite , Maharai the Netophathite , 23 : 29 Heleb the son of Baanah , a Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin , 23 : 30 Benaiah the Pirathonite , Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash , 23 : 31 Abialbon the Arbathite , Azmaveth the Barhumite , 23 : 32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite , of the sons of Jashen , Jonathan , 23 : 33 Shammah the Hararite , Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite , 23 : 34 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai , the son of the Maachathite , Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite , 23 : 35 Hezrai the Carmelite , Paarai the Arbite , 23 : 36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah , Bani the Gadite , 23 : 37 Zelek the Ammonite , Nahari the Beerothite , armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah , 23 : 38 Ira an Ithrite , Gareb an Ithrite , 23 : 39 Uriah the Hittite : thirty and seven in all .
or that there be three days ' pestilence in thy land ?
24 : 18 And Gad came that day to David , and said unto him , Go up , rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite .
24 : 21 And Araunah said , Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant ?
24 : 24 And the king said unto Araunah , Nay ; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price : neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing .
The Third Book of the Kings
1 : 4 And the damsel was very fair , and cherished the king , and ministered to him : but the king knew her not .
1 : 5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , I will be king : and he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
1 : 9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by Enrogel , and called all his brethren the king ' s sons , and all the men of Judah the king ' s servants : 1 : 10 But Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah , and the mighty men , and Solomon his brother , he called not .
why then doth Adonijah reign ?
1 : 18 And now , behold , Adonijah reigneth ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not : 1 : 19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the host : but Solomon thy servant hath he not called .
1 : 26 But me , even me thy servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and thy servant Solomon , hath he not called .
1 : 32 And king David said , Call me Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada .
And they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , God save king Solomon .
1 : 40 And all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
2 : 21 And she said , Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife .
2 : 27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD ; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD , which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
2 : 29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD ; and , behold , he is by the altar .
2 : 30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD , and said unto him , Thus saith the king , Come forth .
And he said , Nay ; but I will die here .
2 : 34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell upon him , and slew him : and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
2 : 39 And it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath .
And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
3 : 5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night : and God said , Ask what I shall give thee .
3 : 6 And Solomon said , Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy , according as he walked before thee in truth , and in righteousness , and in uprightness of heart with thee ; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness , that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne , as it is this day .
3 : 13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
3 : 25 And the king said , Divide the living child in two , and give half to the one , and half to the other .
4 : 21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines , and unto the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
5 : 13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel ; and the levy was thirty thousand men .
5 : 14 And he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses : a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home : and Adoniram was over the levy .
5 : 17 And the king commanded , and they brought great stones , costly stones , and hewed stones , to lay the foundation of the house .
6 : 10 And then he built chambers against all the house , five cubits high : and they rested on the house with timber of cedar .
6 : 18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers : all was cedar ; there was no stone seen .
6 : 19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD .
6 : 21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
6 : 22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
6 : 23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree , each ten cubits high .
6 : 24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
6 : 27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house : and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
6 : 36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone , and a row of cedar beams .
6 : 37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid , in the month Zif : 6 : 38 And in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it .
7 : 19 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch , four cubits .
7 : 21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof Jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and called the name thereof Boaz .
7 : 31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit : but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base , a cubit and an half : and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders , foursquare , not round .
7 : 37 After this manner he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one size .
7 : 40 And Hiram made the lavers , and the shovels , and the basons .
8 : 26 And now , O God of Israel , let thy word , I pray thee , be verified , which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father .
8 : 31 If any man trespass against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house : 8 : 32 Then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
8 : 37 If there be in the land famine , if there be pestilence , blasting , mildew , locust , or if there be caterpiller ; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities ; whatsoever plague , whatsoever sickness there be ; 8 : 38 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man , or by all thy people Israel , which shall know every man the plague of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house : 8 : 39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ;) 8 : 40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers .
9 : 10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the LORD , and the king ' s house , 9 : 11 ( Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
9 : 15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised ; for to build the house of the LORD , and his own house , and Millo , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer .
9 : 23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon ' s work , five hundred and fifty , which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work .
10 : 7 Howbeit I believed not the words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the half was not told me : thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard .
11 : 4 For it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as was the heart of David his father .
11 : 15 For it came to pass , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain , after he had smitten every male in Edom ; 11 : 16 ( For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel , until he had cut off every male in Edom :) 11 : 17 That Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father ' s servants with him , to go into Egypt ; Hadad being yet a little child .
11 : 26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephrathite of Zereda , Solomon ' s servant , whose mother ' s name was Zeruah , a widow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
11 : 36 And unto his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
11 : 41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
11 : 43 And Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
12 : 25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim , and dwelt therein ; and went out from thence , and built Penuel .
12 : 29 And he set the one in Bethel , and the other put he in Dan .
12 : 30 And this thing became a sin : for the people went to worship before the one , even unto Dan .
13 : 1 And , behold , there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel : and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense .
13 : 3 And he gave a sign the same day , saying , This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken ; Behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out .
13 : 8 And the man of God said unto the king , If thou wilt give me half thine house , I will not go in with thee , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place : 13 : 9 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD , saying , Eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest .
13 : 13 And he said unto his sons , Saddle me the ass .
So they saddled him the ass : and he rode thereon , 13 : 14 And went after the man of God , and found him sitting under an oak : and he said unto him , Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah ?
13 : 26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof , he said , It is the man of God , who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD : therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion , which hath torn him , and slain him , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake unto him .
13 : 29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him .
13 : 30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , Alas , my brother !
14 : 2 And Jeroboam said to his wife , Arise , I pray thee , and disguise thyself , that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam ; and get thee to Shiloh : behold , there is Ahijah the prophet , which told me that I should be king over this people .
But Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
14 : 7 Go , tell Jeroboam , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince over my people Israel , 14 : 8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it thee : and yet thou hast not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ; 14 : 9 But hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind thy back : 14 : 10 Therefore , behold , I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam , and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel , and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam , as a man taketh away dung , till it be all gone .
14 : 12 Arise thou therefore , get thee to thine own house : and when thy feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
14 : 14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day : but what ?
even now .
14 : 22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed , above all that their fathers had done .
15 : 9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah .
15 : 12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
15 : 20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abelbethmaachah , and all Cinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
15 : 24 And Asa slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead .
15 : 29 And it came to pass , when he reigned , that he smote all the house of Jeroboam ; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed , until he had destroyed him , according unto the saying of the LORD , which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite : 15 : 30 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger .
15 : 34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
16 : 1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha , saying , 16 : 2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust , and made thee prince over my people Israel ; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam , and hast made my people Israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ; 16 : 3 Behold , I will take away the posterity of Baasha , and the posterity of his house ; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
16 : 9 And his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him , as he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah .
16 : 16 And the people that were encamped heard say , Zimri hath conspired , and hath also slain the king : wherefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
16 : 21 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
17 : 5 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD : for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith , that is before Jordan .
17 : 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath .
17 : 13 And Elijah said unto her , Fear not ; go and do as thou hast said : but make me thereof a little cake first , and bring it unto me , and after make for thee and for thy son .
17 : 18 And she said unto Elijah , What have I to do with thee , O thou man of God ?
18 : 3 And Ahab called Obadiah , which was the governor of his house .
18 : 7 And as Obadiah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , Art thou that my lord Elijah ?
18 : 21 And Elijah came unto all the people , and said , How long halt ye between two opinions ?
And they did it the second time .
And he said , Do it the third time .
18 : 37 Hear me , O LORD , hear me , that this people may know that thou art the LORD God , and that thou hast turned their heart back again .
18 : 44 And it came to pass at the seventh time , that he said , Behold , there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea , like a man ' s hand .
18 : 46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah ; and he girded up his loins , and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
19 : 5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree , behold , then an angel touched him , and said unto him , Arise and eat .
19 : 10 And he said , I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts : for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant , thrown down thine altars , and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and I , even I only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
19 : 17 And it shall come to pass , that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay : and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay .
And he said unto him , Go back again : for what have I done to thee ?
20 : 19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city , and the army which followed them .
20 : 22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel , and said unto him , Go , strengthen thyself , and mark , and see what thou doest : for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee .
20 : 31 And his servants said unto him , Behold now , we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings : let us , I pray thee , put sackcloth on our loins , and ropes upon our heads , and go out to the king of Israel : peradventure he will save thy life .
So he made a covenant with him , and sent him away .
And the king of Israel said unto him , So shall thy judgment be ; thyself hast decided it .
21 : 27 And it came to pass , when Ahab heard those words , that he rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
22 : 8 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , There is yet one man , Micaiah the son of Imlah , by whom we may enquire of the LORD : but I hate him ; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me , but evil .
22 : 10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
22 : 21 And there came forth a spirit , and stood before the LORD , and said , I will persuade him .
And he said , I will go forth , and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets .
22 : 24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near , and smote Micaiah on the cheek , and said , Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee ?
22 : 34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot , Turn thine hand , and carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
22 : 35 And the battle increased that day : and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians , and died at even : and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot .
22 : 40 So Ahab slept with his fathers ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
22 : 42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem .
22 : 46 And the remnant of the sodomites , which remained in the days of his father Asa , he took out of the land .
1 : 7 And he said unto them , What manner of man was he which came up to meet you , and told you these words ?
And he spake unto him , Thou man of God , the king hath said , Come down .
1 : 10 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , If I be a man of God , then let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty .
1 : 11 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty .
And the third captain of fifty went up , and came and fell on his knees before Elijah , and besought him , and said unto him , O man of God , I pray thee , let my life , and the life of these fifty thy servants , be precious in thy sight .
And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; because he had no son .
And he said , Yea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
2 : 4 And Elijah said unto him , Elisha , tarry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho .
2 : 7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood to view afar off : and they two stood by Jordan .
2 : 8 And Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and smote the waters , and they were divided hither and thither , so that they two went over on dry ground .
And Elisha said , I pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me .
2 : 16 And they said unto him , Behold now , there be with thy servants fifty strong men ; let them go , we pray thee , and seek thy master : lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up , and cast him upon some mountain , or into some valley .
2 : 21 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters , and cast the salt in there , and said , Thus saith the LORD , I have healed these waters ; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land .
2 : 25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel , and from thence he returned to Samaria .
3 : 2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD ; but not like his father , and like his mother : for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made .
3 : 6 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time , and numbered all Israel .
3 : 9 So the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
3 : 11 But Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD , that we may enquire of the LORD by him ?
3 : 12 And Jehoshaphat said , The word of the LORD is with him .
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
3 : 16 And he said , Thus saith the LORD , Make this valley full of ditches .
4 : 1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha , saying , Thy servant my husband is dead ; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD : and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen .
tell me , what hast thou in the house ?
And he said unto her , There is not a vessel more .
4 : 7 Then she came and told the man of God .
4 : 11 And it fell on a day , that he came thither , and he turned into the chamber , and lay there .
wouldest thou be spoken for to the king , or to the captain of the host ?
And she answered , I dwell among mine own people .
And she said , Nay , my lord , thou man of God , do not lie unto thine handmaid .
4 : 17 And the woman conceived , and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her , according to the time of life .
4 : 18 And when the child was grown , it fell on a day , that he went out to his father to the reapers .
4 : 25 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel .
4 : 32 And when Elisha was come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
So he called her .
And it came to pass , as they were eating of the pottage , that they cried out , and said , O thou man of God , there is death in the pot .
And they could not eat thereof .
4 : 41 But he said , Then bring meal .
And he cast it into the pot ; and he said , Pour out for the people , that they may eat .
5 : 9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot , and stood at the door of the house of Elisha .
So he turned and went away in a rage .
how much rather then , when he saith to thee , Wash , and be clean ?
5 : 17 And Naaman said , Shall there not then , I pray thee , be given to thy servant two mules ' burden of earth ?
5 : 21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman .
And he answered , I will go .
6 : 14 Therefore sent he thither horses , and chariots , and a great host : and they came by night , and compassed the city about .
And his servant said unto him , Alas , my master !
6 : 18 And when they came down to him , Elisha prayed unto the LORD , and said , Smite this people , I pray thee , with blindness .
And the LORD opened their eyes , and they saw ; and , behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
shall I smite them ?
6 : 32 But Elisha sat in his house , and the elders sat with him ; and the king sent a man from before him : but ere the messenger came to him , he said to the elders , See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head ?
And he said , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
7 : 3 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate : and they said one to another , Why sit we here until we die ?
7 : 6 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots , and a noise of horses , even the noise of a great host : and they said one to another , Lo , the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites , and the kings of the Egyptians , to come upon us .
7 : 8 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp , they went into one tent , and did eat and drink , and carried thence silver , and gold , and raiment , and went and hid it ; and came again , and entered into another tent , and carried thence also , and went and hid it .
7 : 12 And the king arose in the night , and said unto his servants , I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us .
And he said , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
8 : 3 And it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines : and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land .
8 : 6 And when the king asked the woman , she told him .
8 : 7 And Elisha came to Damascus ; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , The man of God is come hither .
8 : 11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly , until he was ashamed : and the man of God wept .
8 : 14 So he departed from Elisha , and came to his master ; who said to him , What said Elisha to thee ?
And he said , Thus and thus spake he to me , saying , Thus saith the LORD , I have anointed thee king over Israel .
9 : 14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram .
And Jehu said , What hast thou to do with peace ?
Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground , according to the word of the LORD .
9 : 32 And he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ?
So they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot .
9 : 36 Wherefore they came again , and told him .
10 : 6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them , saying , If ye be mine , and if ye will hearken unto my voice , take ye the heads of the men your master ' s sons , and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time .
10 : 7 And it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king ' s sons , and slew seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent him them to Jezreel .
If it be , give me thine hand .
10 : 23 And Jehu went , and Jehonadab the son of Rechab , into the house of Baal , and said unto the worshippers of Baal , Search , and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD , but the worshippers of Baal only .
10 : 35 And Jehu slept with his fathers : and they buried him in Samaria .
11 : 2 But Jehosheba , the daughter of king Joram , sister of Ahaziah , took Joash the son of Ahaziah , and stole him from among the king ' s sons which were slain ; and they hid him , even him and his nurse , in the bedchamber from Athaliah , so that he was not slain .
11 : 5 And he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king ' s house ; 11 : 6 And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD .
11 : 20 And all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was in quiet : and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king ' s house .
now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house .
12 : 15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men , into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen : for they dealt faithfully .
12 : 19 And the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
13 : 2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
13 : 9 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in Samaria : and Joash his son reigned in his stead .
13 : 14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died .
13 : 15 And Elisha said unto him , Take bow and arrows .
And he took unto him bow and arrows .
And he said , The arrow of the LORD ' s deliverance , and the arrow of deliverance from Syria : for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek , till thou have consumed them .
13 : 20 And Elisha died , and they buried him .
13 : 23 And the LORD was gracious unto them , and had compassion on them , and had respect unto them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
13 : 24 So Hazael king of Syria died ; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead .
14 : 4 Howbeit the high places were not taken away : as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places .
14 : 11 But Amaziah would not hear .
14 : 12 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel ; and they fled every man to their tents .
14 : 13 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Bethshemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
14 : 18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
14 : 22 He built Elath , and restored it to Judah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
14 : 23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria , and reigned forty and one years .
14 : 24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
15 : 14 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria , and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
15 : 15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
15 : 16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah , and all that were therein , and the coasts thereof from Tirzah : because they opened not to him , therefore he smote it ; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up .
15 : 17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel , and reigned ten years in Samaria .
15 : 26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
15 : 28 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
15 : 31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
15 : 32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign .
And his mother ' s name was Jerusha , the daughter of Zadok .
16 : 4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
16 : 6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drave the Jews from Elath : and the Syrians came to Elath , and dwelt there unto this day .
16 : 9 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him : for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried the people of it captive to Kir , and slew Rezin .
16 : 13 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
16 : 18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house , and the king ' s entry without , turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria .
17 : 2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
17 : 10 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill , and under every green tree : 17 : 11 And there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them ; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger : 17 : 12 For they served idols , whereof the LORD had said unto them , Ye shall not do this thing .
17 : 14 Notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks , like to the neck of their fathers , that did not believe in the LORD their God .
17 : 29 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt .
18 : 2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem .
18 : 9 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
18 : 14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish , saying , I have offended ; return from me : that which thou puttest on me will I bear .
18 : 28 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spake , saying , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria : 18 : 29 Thus saith the king , Let not Hezekiah deceive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand : 18 : 30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD , saying , The LORD will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand ?
19 : 9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , Behold , he is come out to fight against thee : he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah , saying , 19 : 10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
19 : 15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD , and said , O LORD God of Israel , which dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the God , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth ; thou hast made heaven and earth .
19 : 22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ?
19 : 34 For I will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant David ' s sake .
19 : 37 And it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of Armenia .
And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead .
And they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered .
20 : 11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD : and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward , by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz .
20 : 13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them , and shewed them all the house of his precious things , the silver , and the gold , and the spices , and the precious ointment , and all the house of his armour , and all that was found in his treasures : there was nothing in his house , nor in all his dominion , that Hezekiah shewed them not .
And Hezekiah answered , All the things that are in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them .
20 : 20 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made a pool , and a conduit , and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
And his mother ' s name was Hephzibah .
21 : 13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria , and the plummet of the house of Ahab : and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish , wiping it , and turning it upside down .
21 : 17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
21 : 23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him , and slew the king in his own house .
23 : 3 And the king stood by a pillar , and made a covenant before the LORD , to walk after the LORD , and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul , to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book .
23 : 20 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars , and burned men ' s bones upon them , and returned to Jerusalem .
23 : 22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ; 23 : 23 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem .
23 : 25 And like unto him was there no king before him , that turned to the LORD with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
24 : 7 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
24 : 20 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
25 : 6 So they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment upon him .

10 : 4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me .
So Saul took a sword , and fell upon it .
10 : 7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , then they forsook their cities , and fled : and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
10 : 8 And it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
11 : 1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron , saying , Behold , we are thy bone and thy flesh .
12 : 2 They were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow , even of Saul ' s brethren of Benjamin .
12 : 19 And there fell some of Manasseh to David , when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle : but they helped them not : for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away , saying , He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads .
12 : 21 And they helped David against the band of the rovers : for they were all mighty men of valour , and were captains in the host .
12 : 24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , ready armed to the war .
12 : 27 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites , and with him were three thousand and seven hundred ; 12 : 28 And Zadok , a young man mighty of valour , and of his father ' s house twenty and two captains .
13 : 4 And all the congregation said that they would do so : for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
13 : 9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark ; for the oxen stumbled .
14 : 3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem : and David begat more sons and daughters .
14 : 4 Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem ; Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon , 14 : 5 And Ibhar , and Elishua , and Elpalet , 14 : 6 And Nogah , and Nepheg , and Japhia , 14 : 7 And Elishama , and Beeliada , and Eliphalet .
14 : 11 So they came up to Baalperazim ; and David smote them there .
14 : 15 And it shall be , when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt go out to battle : for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines .
15 : 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel .
15 : 15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD .
15 : 16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
15 : 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brethren , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brethren , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ; 15 : 18 And with them their brethren of the second degree , Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obededom , and Jeiel , the porters .
15 : 29 And it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David , that Michal , the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she despised him in her heart .
16 : 1 So they brought the ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God .
16 : 3 And he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
16 : 27 Glory and honour are in his presence ; strength and gladness are in his place .
16 : 35 And say ye , Save us , O God of our salvation , and gather us together , and deliver us from the heathen , that we may give thanks to thy holy name , and glory in thy praise .
16 : 36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever .
And the sons of Jeduthun were porters .
17 : 1 Now it came to pass , as David sat in his house , that David said to Nathan the prophet , Lo , I dwell in an house of cedars , but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains .
17 : 2 Then Nathan said unto David , Do all that is in thine heart ; for God is with thee .
17 : 3 And it came to pass the same night , that the word of God came to Nathan , saying , 17 : 4 Go and tell David my servant , Thus saith the LORD , Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in : 17 : 5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day ; but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tabernacle to another .
17 : 6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel , spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel , whom I commanded to feed my people , saying , Why have ye not built me an house of cedars ?
17 : 9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , and they shall dwell in their place , and shall be moved no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more , as at the beginning , 17 : 10 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel .
17 : 23 Therefore now , LORD , let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever , and do as thou hast said .
And the king said , Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown , and then return .
19 : 14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle ; and they fled before him .
20 : 1 And it came to pass , that after the year was expired , at the time that kings go out to battle , Joab led forth the power of the army , and wasted the country of the children of Ammon , and came and besieged Rabbah .
Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon .
20 : 5 And there was war again with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite , whose spear staff was like a weaver ' s beam .
why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel ?
Wherefore Joab departed , and went throughout all Israel , and came to Jerusalem .
Then David and the elders of Israel , who were clothed in sackcloth , fell upon their faces .
21 : 17 And David said unto God , Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered ?
22 : 17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying , 22 : 18 Is not the LORD your God with you ?
and hath he not given you rest on every side ?
23 : 1 So when David was old and full of days , he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
23 : 15 The sons of Moses were , Gershom , and Eliezer .
24 : 23 And the sons of Hebron ; Jeriah the first , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third , Jekameam the fourth .
24 : 24 Of the sons of Uzziel ; Michah : of the sons of Michah ; Shamir .
24 : 29 Concerning Kish : the son of Kish was Jerahmeel .
25 : 3 Of Jeduthun : the sons of Jeduthun ; Gedaliah , and Zeri , and Jeshaiah , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah , six , under the hands of their father Jeduthun , who prophesied with a harp , to give thanks and to praise the LORD .
25 : 8 And they cast lots , ward against ward , as well the small as the great , the teacher as the scholar .
26 : 8 All these of the sons of Obededom : they and their sons and their brethren , able men for strength for the service , were threescore and two of Obededom .
26 : 10 Also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons ; Simri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him the chief ;) 26 : 11 Hilkiah the second , Tebaliah the third , Zechariah the fourth : all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen .
26 : 25 And his brethren by Eliezer ; Rehabiah his son , and Jeshaiah his son , and Joram his son , and Zichri his son , and Shelomith his son .
26 : 30 And of the Hebronites , Hashabiah and his brethren , men of valour , a thousand and seven hundred , were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD , and in the service of the king .
27 : 7 The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab , and Zebadiah his son after him : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
27 : 11 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite , of the Zarhites : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
27 : 12 The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite , of the Benjamites : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
27 : 15 The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite , of Othniel : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
These were the princes of the tribes of Israel .
28 : 16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver : 28 : 17 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks , and the bowls , and the cups : and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason ; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver : 28 : 18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims , that spread out their wings , and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD .
29 : 10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation : and David said , Blessed be thou , LORD God of Israel our father , for ever and ever .
And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and worshipped the LORD , and the king .
1 : 3 So Solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness .
1 : 9 Now , O LORD God , let thy promise unto David my father be established : for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
2 : 3 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre , saying , As thou didst deal with David my father , and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein , even so deal with me .
who am I then , that I should build him an house , save only to burn sacrifice before him ?
2 : 11 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , Because the LORD hath loved his people , he hath made thee king over them .
3 : 12 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was five cubits also , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
3 : 13 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were inward .
3 : 15 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high , and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
4 : 3 And under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about .
4 : 4 It stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
4 : 5 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
And he made an hundred basons of gold .
4 : 10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end , over against the south .
5 : 9 And they drew out the staves of the ark , that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen without .
6 : 7 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel .
6 : 11 And in it have I put the ark , wherein is the covenant of the LORD , that he made with the children of Israel .
6 : 40 Now , my God , let , I beseech thee , thine eyes be open , and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
7 : 3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down , and the glory of the LORD upon the house , they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement , and worshipped , and praised the LORD , saying , For he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
7 : 11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD , and the king ' s house : and all that came into Solomon ' s heart to make in the house of the LORD , and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
7 : 12 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night , and said unto him , I have heard thy prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
7 : 19 But if ye turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments , which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ; 7 : 20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have sanctified for my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations .
7 : 21 And this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
8 : 4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness , and all the store cities , which he built in Hamath .
8 : 10 And these were the chief of king Solomon ' s officers , even two hundred and fifty , that bare rule over the people .
8 : 12 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD , which he had built before the porch , 8 : 13 Even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
8 : 17 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber , and to Eloth , at the sea side in the land of Edom .
8 : 18 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships , and servants that had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
9 : 1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon , she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem , with a very great company , and camels that bare spices , and gold in abundance , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she communed with him of all that was in her heart .
9 : 8 Blessed be the LORD thy God , which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne , to be king for the LORD thy God : because thy God loved Israel , to establish them for ever , therefore made he thee king over them , to do judgment and justice .
9 : 23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , that God had put in his heart .
9 : 25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen ; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
9 : 28 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt , and out of all lands .
10 : 2 And it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was in Egypt , whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
10 : 8 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
10 : 13 And the king answered them roughly ; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men , 10 : 14 And answered them after the advice of the young men , saying , My father made your yoke heavy , but I will add thereto : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse : every man to your tents , O Israel : and now , David , see to thine own house .
10 : 19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day .
11 : 12 And in every several city he put shields and spears , and made them exceeding strong , having Judah and Benjamin on his side .
11 : 14 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest ' s office unto the LORD : 11 : 15 And he ordained him priests for the high places , and for the devils , and for the calves which he had made .
11 : 18 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife , and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse ; 11 : 19 Which bare him children ; Jeush , and Shamariah , and Zaham .
And he desired many wives .
12 : 6 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves ; and they said , The LORD is righteous .
12 : 7 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah , saying , They have humbled themselves ; therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliverance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
12 : 8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants ; that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries .
And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
13 : 17 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter : so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
13 : 20 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah : and the LORD struck him , and he died .
14 : 5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
14 : 6 And he built fenced cities in Judah : for the land had rest , and he had no war in those years ; because the LORD had given him rest .
14 : 10 Then Asa went out against him , and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .
O LORD , thou art our God ; let no man prevail against thee .
15 : 9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin , and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh , and out of Simeon : for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance , when they saw that the LORD his God was with him .
15 : 19 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa .
16 : 4 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abelmaim , and all the store cities of Naphtali .
16 : 5 And it came to pass , when Baasha heard it , that he left off building of Ramah , and let his work cease .
16 : 7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not relied on the LORD thy God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand .
17 : 3 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first ways of his father David , and sought not unto Baalim ; 17 : 4 But sought to the Lord God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
17 : 8 And with them he sent Levites , even Shemaiah , and Nethaniah , and Zebadiah , and Asahel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehonathan , and Adonijah , and Tobijah , and Tobadonijah , Levites ; and with them Elishama and Jehoram , priests .
17 : 19 These waited on the king , beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah .
18 : 2 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria .
And he answered him , I am as thou art , and my people as thy people ; and we will be with thee in the war .
18 : 4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , Enquire , I pray thee , at the word of the LORD to day .
18 : 8 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers , and said , Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla .
18 : 17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me , but evil ?
18 : 22 Now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee .
18 : 29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and I will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes .
and in thine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ?
20 : 7 Art not thou our God , who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel , and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever ?
20 : 12 O our God , wilt thou not judge them ?
20 : 24 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
20 : 25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them , they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies , and precious jewels , which they stripped off for themselves , more than they could carry away : and they were three days in gathering of the spoil , it was so much .
20 : 28 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD .
And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
21 : 3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fenced cities in Judah : but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram ; because he was the firstborn .
21 : 6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of Ahab : for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD .
21 : 11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , and compelled Judah thereto .
And his people made no burning for him , like the burning of his fathers .
His mother ' s name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri .
22 : 7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram : for when he was come , he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi , whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab .
23 : 1 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into covenant with him .
And he said unto them , Behold , the king ' s son shall reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David .
23 : 7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and whosoever else cometh into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he cometh in , and when he goeth out .
His mother ' s name also was Zibiah of Beersheba .
24 : 18 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers , and served groves and idols : and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass .
24 : 22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son .
25 : 2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , but not with a perfect heart .
25 : 5 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together , and made them captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , according to the houses of their fathers , throughout all Judah and Benjamin : and he numbered them from twenty years old and above , and found them three hundred thousand choice men , able to go forth to war , that could handle spear and shield .
And the man of God answered , The LORD is able to give thee much more than this .
26 : 2 He built Eloth , and restored it to Judah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
26 : 20 And Azariah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked upon him , and , behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out from thence ; yea , himself hasted also to go out , because the LORD had smitten him .
28 : 4 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
28 : 5 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria ; and they smote him , and carried away a great multitude of them captives , and brought them to Damascus .
28 : 7 And Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , slew Maaseiah the king ' s son , and Azrikam the governor of the house , and Elkanah that was next to the king .
28 : 8 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
28 : 14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation .
28 : 17 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah , and carried away captives .
29 : 9 For , lo , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings ; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings .
29 : 35 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and the drink offerings for every burnt offering .
So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order .
30 : 9 For if ye turn again unto the LORD , your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive , so that they shall come again into this land : for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful , and will not turn away his face from you , if ye return unto him .
30 : 10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun : but they laughed them to scorn , and mocked them .
30 : 13 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great congregation .
30 : 15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD .
30 : 20 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah , and healed the people .
30 : 24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
30 : 27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people : and their voice was heard , and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place , even unto heaven .
31 : 3 He appointed also the king ' s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , to wit , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths , and for the new moons , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of the LORD .
31 : 6 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah , that dwelt in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God , and laid them by heaps .
31 : 7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
31 : 11 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD ; and they prepared them , 31 : 12 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully : over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler , and Shimei his brother was the next .
32 : 1 After these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
32 : 12 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , Ye shall worship before one altar , and burn incense upon it ?
32 : 17 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel , and to speak against him , saying , As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand , so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand .
32 : 22 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all other , and guided them on every side .
32 : 24 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death , and prayed unto the LORD : and he spake unto him , and he gave him a sign .
32 : 25 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath upon him , and upon Judah and Jerusalem .
32 : 29 Moreover he provided him cities , and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance : for God had given him substance very much .
32 : 30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon , and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David .
33 : 4 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD , whereof the LORD had said , In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever .
Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God .
33 : 14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David , on the west side of Gihon , in the valley , even to the entering in at the fish gate , and compassed about Ophel , and raised it up a very great height , and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah .
33 : 17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places , yet unto the LORD their God only .
33 : 21 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned two years in Jerusalem .
34 : 4 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence ; and the images , that were on high above them , he cut down ; and the groves , and the carved images , and the molten images , he brake in pieces , and made dust of them , and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them .
34 : 6 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh , and Ephraim , and Simeon , even unto Naphtali , with their mattocks round about .
34 : 8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land , and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the LORD his God .
34 : 16 And Shaphan carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to thy servants , they do it .
34 : 18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book .
34 : 23 And she answered them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Tell ye the man that sent you to me , 34 : 24 Thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah : 34 : 25 Because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place , and shall not be quenched .
And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
35 : 15 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place , according to the commandment of David , and Asaph , and Heman , and Jeduthun the king ' s seer ; and the porters waited at every gate ; they might not depart from their service ; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them .
35 : 24 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had ; and they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers .
35 : 25 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day , and made them an ordinance in Israel : and , behold , they are written in the lamentations .
36 : 2 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months in Jerusalem .
And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother , and carried him to Egypt .
36 : 6 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to Babylon .
36 : 7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
36 : 8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
36 : 13 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel .
1 : 5 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Levites , with all them whose spirit God had raised , to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem .
1 : 6 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
2 : 1 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity , of those which had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon , and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah , every one unto his city ; 2 : 2 Which came with Zerubbabel : Jeshua , Nehemiah , Seraiah , Reelaiah , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mizpar , Bigvai , Rehum , Baanah .
2 : 5 The children of Arah , seven hundred seventy and five .
2 : 9 The children of Zaccai , seven hundred and threescore .
2 : 10 The children of Bani , six hundred forty and two .
2 : 13 The children of Adonikam , six hundred sixty and six .
2 : 14 The children of Bigvai , two thousand fifty and six .
2 : 22 The men of Netophah , fifty and six .
2 : 26 The children of Ramah and Gaba , six hundred twenty and one .
2 : 31 The children of the other Elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
2 : 32 The children of Harim , three hundred and twenty .
2 : 34 The children of Jericho , three hundred forty and five .
2 : 59 And these were they which went up from Telmelah , Telharsa , Cherub , Addan , and Immer : but they could not shew their father ' s house , and their seed , whether they were of Israel : 2 : 60 The children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred fifty and two .
3 : 7 They gave money also unto the masons , and to the carpenters ; and meat , and drink , and oil , unto them of Zidon , and to them of Tyre , to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa , according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia .
And all the people shouted with a great shout , when they praised the LORD , because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid .
4 : 14 Now because we have maintenance from the king ' s palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king ' s dishonour , therefore have we sent and certified the king ; 4 : 15 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers : so shalt thou find in the book of the records , and know that this city is a rebellious city , and hurtful unto kings and provinces , and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time : for which cause was this city destroyed .
4 : 17 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor , and to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria , and unto the rest beyond the river , Peace , and at such a time .
4 : 18 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me .
4 : 19 And I commanded , and search hath been made , and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
4 : 20 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem , which have ruled over all countries beyond the river ; and toll , tribute , and custom , was paid unto them .
4 : 22 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
5 : 10 We asked their names also , to certify thee , that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them .
6 : 2 And there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of the Medes , a roll , and therein was a record thus written : 6 : 3 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem , Let the house be builded , the place where they offered sacrifices , and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid ; the height thereof threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof threescore cubits ; 6 : 4 With three rows of great stones , and a row of new timber : and let the expenses be given out of the king ' s house : 6 : 5 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem , and brought unto Babylon , be restored , and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem , every one to his place , and place them in the house of God .
7 : 19 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God , those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem .
7 : 20 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God , which thou shalt have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king ' s treasure house .
8 : 2 Of the sons of Phinehas ; Gershom : of the sons of Ithamar ; Daniel : of the sons of David ; Hattush .
8 : 10 And of the sons of Shelomith ; the son of Josiphiah , and with him an hundred and threescore males .
8 : 12 And of the sons of Azgad ; Johanan the son of Hakkatan , and with him an hundred and ten males .
8 : 36 And they delivered the king ' s commissions unto the king ' s lieutenants , and to the governors on this side the river : and they furthered the people , and the house of God .
9 : 8 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God , to leave us a remnant to escape , and to give us a nail in his holy place , that our God may lighten our eyes , and give us a little reviving in our bondage .
10 : 3 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives , and such as are born of them , according to the counsel of my lord , and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God ; and let it be done according to the law .
10 : 13 But the people are many , and it is a time of much rain , and we are not able to stand without , neither is this a work of one day or two : for we are many that have transgressed in this thing .
10 : 17 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month .
10 : 21 And of the sons of Harim ; Maaseiah , and Elijah , and Shemaiah , and Jehiel , and Uzziah .
10 : 22 And of the sons of Pashur ; Elioenai , Maaseiah , Ishmael , Nethaneel , Jozabad , and Elasah .
10 : 24 Of the singers also ; Eliashib : and of the porters ; Shallum , and Telem , and Uri .
2 : 4 Then the king said unto me , For what dost thou make request ?
2 : 6 And the king said unto me , ( the queen also sitting by him ,) For how long shall thy journey be ?
So it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
2 : 17 Then said I unto them , Ye see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem lieth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire : come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach .
2 : 20 Then answered I them , and said unto them , The God of heaven , he will prosper us ; therefore we his servants will arise and build : but ye have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in Jerusalem .
3 : 11 Malchijah the son of Harim , and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab , repaired the other piece , and the tower of the furnaces .
3 : 13 The valley gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate .
3 : 16 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of the half part of Bethzur , unto the place over against the sepulchres of David , and to the pool that was made , and unto the house of the mighty .
Next unto him repaired Hashabiah , the ruler of the half part of Keilah , in his part .
After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house .
3 : 30 After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah , and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph , another piece .
will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned ?
4 : 6 So built we the wall ; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof : for the people had a mind to work .
4 : 12 And it came to pass , that when the Jews which dwelt by them came , they said unto us ten times , From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you .
5 : 3 Some also there were that said , We have mortgaged our lands , vineyards , and houses , that we might buy corn , because of the dearth .
5 : 4 There were also that said , We have borrowed money for the king ' s tribute , and that upon our lands and vineyards .
5 : 6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words .
5 : 10 I likewise , and my brethren , and my servants , might exact of them money and corn : I pray you , let us leave off this usury .
5 : 12 Then said they , We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do as thou sayest .
Then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they should do according to this promise .
6 : 1 Now it came to pass when Sanballat , and Tobiah , and Geshem the Arabian , and the rest of our enemies , heard that I had builded the wall , and that there was no breach left therein ; ( though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates ;) 6 : 2 That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me , saying , Come , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono .
6 : 13 Therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
6 : 16 And it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the heathen that were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God .
6 : 17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah , and the letters of Tobiah came unto them .
7 : 9 The children of Shephatiah , three hundred seventy and two .
7 : 17 The children of Azgad , two thousand three hundred twenty and two .
7 : 23 The children of Bezai , three hundred twenty and four .
7 : 26 The men of Bethlehem and Netophah , an hundred fourscore and eight .
7 : 41 The children of Pashur , a thousand two hundred forty and seven .
7 : 43 The Levites : the children of Jeshua , of Kadmiel , and of the children of Hodevah , seventy and four .
7 : 46 The Nethinims : the children of Ziha , the children of Hashupha , the children of Tabbaoth , 7 : 47 The children of Keros , the children of Sia , the children of Padon , 7 : 48 The children of Lebana , the children of Hagaba , the children of Shalmai , 7 : 49 The children of Hanan , the children of Giddel , the children of Gahar , 7 : 50 The children of Reaiah , the children of Rezin , the children of Nekoda , 7 : 51 The children of Gazzam , the children of Uzza , the children of Phaseah , 7 : 52 The children of Besai , the children of Meunim , the children of Nephishesim , 7 : 53 The children of Bakbuk , the children of Hakupha , the children of Harhur , 7 : 54 The children of Bazlith , the children of Mehida , the children of Harsha , 7 : 55 The children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Tamah , 7 : 56 The children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha .
The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold , fifty basons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
7 : 72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold , and two thousand pound of silver , and threescore and seven priests ' garments .
8 : 13 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , unto Ezra the scribe , even to understand the words of the law .
8 : 16 So the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of Ephraim .
9 : 2 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers , and stood and confessed their sins , and the iniquities of their fathers .
9 : 6 Thou , even thou , art LORD alone ; thou hast made heaven , the heaven of heavens , with all their host , the earth , and all things that are therein , the seas , and all that is therein , and thou preservest them all ; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee .
9 : 7 Thou art the LORD the God , who didst choose Abram , and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gavest him the name of Abraham ; 9 : 8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee , and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Jebusites , and the Girgashites , to give it , I say , to his seed , and hast performed thy words ; for thou art righteous : 9 : 9 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt , and heardest their cry by the Red sea ; 9 : 10 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them .
9 : 27 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies , who vexed them : and in the time of their trouble , when they cried unto thee , thou heardest them from heaven ; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours , who saved them out of the hand of their enemies .
10 : 32 Also we made ordinances for us , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God ; 10 : 33 For the shewbread , and for the continual meat offering , and for the continual burnt offering , of the sabbaths , of the new moons , for the set feasts , and for the holy things , and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel , and for all the work of the house of our God .
10 : 39 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn , of the new wine , and the oil , unto the chambers , where are the vessels of the sanctuary , and the priests that minister , and the porters , and the singers : and we will not forsake the house of our God .
11 : 9 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer : and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city .
11 : 31 The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash , and Aija , and Bethel , and in their villages .
11 : 32 And at Anathoth , Nob , Ananiah , 11 : 33 Hazor , Ramah , Gittaim , 11 : 34 Hadid , Zeboim , Neballat , 11 : 35 Lod , and Ono , the valley of craftsmen .
12 : 1 Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua : Seraiah , Jeremiah , Ezra , 12 : 2 Amariah , Malluch , Hattush , 12 : 3 Shechaniah , Rehum , Meremoth , 12 : 4 Iddo , Ginnetho , Abijah , 12 : 5 Miamin , Maadiah , Bilgah , 12 : 6 Shemaiah , and Joiarib , Jedaiah , 12 : 7 Sallu , Amok , Hilkiah , Jedaiah .
12 : 9 Also Bakbukiah and Unni , their brethren , were over against them in the watches .
12 : 28 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together , both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem , and from the villages of Netophathi ; 12 : 29 Also from the house of Gilgal , and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth : for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem .
12 : 38 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them , and I after them , and the half of the people upon the wall , from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall ; 12 : 39 And from above the gate of Ephraim , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the tower of Hananeel , and the tower of Meah , even unto the sheep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
13 : 11 Then contended I with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of God forsaken ?
13 : 18 Did not your fathers thus , and did not our God bring all this evil upon us , and upon this city ?
yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath .
if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you .
13 : 22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the sabbath day .
13 : 26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things ?
13 : 27 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil , to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives ?
Remember me , O my God , for good .
1 : 8 And the drinking was according to the law ; none did compel : for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house , that they should do according to every man ' s pleasure .
1 : 10 On the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king , 1 : 11 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal , to shew the people and the princes her beauty : for she was fair to look on .
1 : 16 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes , Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes , and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus .
1 : 19 If it please the king , let there go a royal commandment from him , and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes , that it be not altered , That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus ; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she .
2 : 10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred : for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it .
And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her .
2 : 16 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
2 : 20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people ; as Mordecai had charged her : for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai , like as when she was brought up with him .
3 : 1 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all the princes that were with him .
3 : 2 And all the king ' s servants , that were in the king ' s gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him .
3 : 3 Then the king ' s servants , which were in the king ' s gate , said unto Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the king ' s commandment ?
3 : 9 If it please the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed : and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business , to bring it into the king ' s treasuries .
3 : 10 And the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy .
3 : 13 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king ' s provinces , to destroy , to kill , and to cause to perish , all Jews , both young and old , little children and women , in one day , even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar , and to take the spoil of them for a prey .
3 : 14 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
4 : 9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai .
and what is thy request ?
So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ?
Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king ' s house , to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
6 : 10 Then the king said to Haman , Make haste , and take the apparel and the horse , as thou hast said , and do even so to Mordecai the Jew , that sitteth at the king ' s gate : let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken .
Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him , If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews , before whom thou hast begun to fall , thou shalt not prevail against him , but shalt surely fall before him .
Then said the king , Will he force the queen also before me in the house ?
8 : 3 And Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
8 : 17 And in every province , and in every city , whithersoever the king ' s commandment and his decree came , the Jews had joy and gladness , a feast and a good day .
And many of the people of the land became Jews ; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them .
9 : 12 And the king said unto Esther the queen , The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace , and the ten sons of Haman ; what have they done in the rest of the king ' s provinces ?
and it shall be done .
9 : 15 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
9 : 29 Then Esther the queen , the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew , wrote with all authority , to confirm this second letter of Purim .
10 : 2 And all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai , whereunto the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
1 : 2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters .
And Satan answered the LORD , and said , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
2 : 7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
2 : 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal ; and he sat down among the ashes .
curse God , and die .
In all this did not Job sin with his lips .
2 : 13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spake a word unto him : for they saw that his grief was very great .
3 : 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day : 3 : 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother ' s womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes .
3 : 18 There the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor .
4 : 8 Even as I have seen , they that plow iniquity , and sow wickedness , reap the same .
4 : 18 Behold , he put no trust in his servants ; and his angels he charged with folly : 4 : 19 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ?
4 : 21 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away ?
5 : 5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up , and taketh it even out of the thorns , and the robber swalloweth up their substance .
5 : 16 So the poor hath hope , and iniquity stoppeth her mouth .
6 : 4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me , the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit : the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me .
6 : 7 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat .
6 : 11 What is my strength , that I should hope ?
and is wisdom driven quite from me ?
cannot my taste discern perverse things ?
7 : 9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away : so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more .
8 : 7 Though thy beginning was small , yet thy latter end should greatly increase .
8 : 15 He shall lean upon his house , but it shall not stand : he shall hold it fast , but it shall not endure .
8 : 20 Behold , God will not cast away a perfect man , neither will he help the evil doers : 8 : 21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing , and thy lips with rejoicing .
8 : 22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame ; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought .
9 : 3 If he will contend with him , he cannot answer him one of a thousand .
9 : 9 Which maketh Arcturus , Orion , and Pleiades , and the chambers of the south .
9 : 17 For he breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause .
9 : 20 If I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
9 : 21 Though I were perfect , yet would I not know my soul : I would despise my life .
9 : 29 If I be wicked , why then labour I in vain ?
9 : 33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us , that might lay his hand upon us both .
10 : 1 My soul is weary of my life ; I will leave my complaint upon myself ; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
10 : 10 Hast thou not poured me out as milk , and curdled me like cheese ?
10 : 13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart : I know that this is with thee .
canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection ?
11 : 15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot ; yea , thou shalt be stedfast , and shalt not fear : 11 : 16 Because thou shalt forget thy misery , and remember it as waters that pass away : 11 : 17 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday : thou shalt shine forth , thou shalt be as the morning .
12 : 7 But ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee : 12 : 8 Or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee : and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee .
12 : 16 With him is strength and wisdom : the deceived and the deceiver are his .
12 : 18 He looseth the bond of kings , and girdeth their loins with a girdle .
12 : 21 He poureth contempt upon princes , and weakeneth the strength of the mighty .
13 : 5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace !
will ye contend for God ?
13 : 15 Though he slay me , yet will I trust in him : but I will maintain mine own ways before him .
13 : 20 Only do not two things unto me : then will I not hide myself from thee .
14 : 2 He cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not .
14 : 4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ?
14 : 21 His sons come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perceiveth it not of them .
15 : 3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk ?
15 : 6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not I : yea , thine own lips testify against thee .
what understandest thou , which is not in us ?
15 : 16 How much more abominable and filthy is man , which drinketh iniquity like water ?
15 : 24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
16 : 8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face .
16 : 13 His archers compass me round about , he cleaveth my reins asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
16 : 15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin , and defiled my horn in the dust .
16 : 16 My face is foul with weeping , and on my eyelids is the shadow of death ; 16 : 17 Not for any injustice in mine hands : also my prayer is pure .
16 : 18 O earth , cover not thou my blood , and let my cry have no place .
16 : 19 Also now , behold , my witness is in heaven , and my record is on high .
17 : 7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow , and all my members are as a shadow .
17 : 10 But as for you all , do ye return , and come now : for I cannot find one wise man among you .
mark , and afterwards we will speak .
18 : 8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walketh upon a snare .
18 : 13 It shall devour the strength of his skin : even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength .
18 : 19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people , nor any remaining in his dwellings .
19 : 14 My kinsfolk have failed , and my familiar friends have forgotten me .
19 : 16 I called my servant , and he gave me no answer ; I intreated him with my mouth .
19 : 17 My breath is strange to my wife , though I intreated for the children ' s sake of mine own body .
19 : 18 Yea , young children despised me ; I arose , and they spake against me .
19 : 19 All my inward friends abhorred me : and they whom I loved are turned against me .
19 : 21 Have pity upon me , have pity upon me , O ye my friends ; for the hand of God hath touched me .
20 : 3 I have heard the check of my reproach , and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer .
20 : 8 He shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found : yea , he shall be chased away as a vision of the night .
20 : 26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
21 : 14 Therefore they say unto God , Depart from us ; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways .
and what profit should we have , if we pray unto him ?
21 : 17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out !
21 : 19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children : he rewardeth him , and he shall know it .
21 : 21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
and thine iniquities infinite ?
22 : 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink , and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry .
22 : 9 Thou hast sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken .
22 : 12 Is not God in the height of heaven ?
22 : 20 Whereas our substance is not cut down , but the remnant of them the fire consumeth .
22 : 23 If thou return to the Almighty , thou shalt be built up , thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles .
22 : 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
23 : 3 Oh that I knew where I might find him !
23 : 6 Will he plead against me with his great power ?
23 : 8 Behold , I go forward , but he is not there ; and backward , but I cannot perceive him : 23 : 9 On the left hand , where he doth work , but I cannot behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I cannot see him : 23 : 10 But he knoweth the way that I take : when he hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
24 : 2 Some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away flocks , and feed thereof .
24 : 5 Behold , as wild asses in the desert , go they forth to their work ; rising betimes for a prey : the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children .
24 : 7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing , that they have no covering in the cold .
24 : 9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor .
24 : 10 They cause him to go naked without clothing , and they take away the sheaf from the hungry ; 24 : 11 Which make oil within their walls , and tread their winepresses , and suffer thirst .
24 : 14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy , and in the night is as a thief .
24 : 19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters : so doth the grave those which have sinned .
25 : 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite , and said , 25 : 2 Dominion and fear are with him , he maketh peace in his high places .
25 : 3 Is there any number of his armies ?
how savest thou the arm that hath no strength ?
and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is ?
and whose spirit came from thee ?
26 : 10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds , until the day and night come to an end .
26 : 11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof .
27 : 1 Moreover Job continued his parable , and said , 27 : 2 As God liveth , who hath taken away my judgment ; and the Almighty , who hath vexed my soul ; 27 : 3 All the while my breath is in me , and the spirit of God is in my nostrils ; 27 : 4 My lips shall not speak wickedness , nor my tongue utter deceit .
will he always call upon God ?
27 : 19 The rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gathered : he openeth his eyes , and he is not .
28 : 5 As for the earth , out of it cometh bread : and under it is turned up as it were fire .
28 : 9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock ; he overturneth the mountains by the roots .
and where is the place of understanding ?
28 : 14 The depth saith , It is not in me : and the sea saith , It is not with me .
29 : 1 Moreover Job continued his parable , and said , 29 : 2 Oh that I were as in months past , as in the days when God preserved me ; 29 : 3 When his candle shined upon my head , and when by his light I walked through darkness ; 29 : 4 As I was in the days of my youth , when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle ; 29 : 5 When the Almighty was yet with me , when my children were about me ; 29 : 6 When I washed my steps with butter , and the rock poured me out rivers of oil ; 29 : 7 When I went out to the gate through the city , when I prepared my seat in the street !
29 : 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me : and I caused the widow ' s heart to sing for joy .
29 : 18 Then I said , I shall die in my nest , and I shall multiply my days as the sand .
29 : 22 After my words they spake not again ; and my speech dropped upon them .
31 : 2 For what portion of God is there from above ?
and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity ?
31 : 5 If I have walked with vanity , or if my foot hath hasted to deceit ; 31 : 6 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity .
31 : 7 If my step hath turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands ; 31 : 8 Then let me sow , and let another eat ; yea , let my offspring be rooted out .
31 : 9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman , or if I have laid wait at my neighbour ' s door ; 31 : 10 Then let my wife grind unto another , and let others bow down upon her .
31 : 15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him ?
31 : 31 If the men of my tabernacle said not , Oh that we had of his flesh !
31 : 32 The stranger did not lodge in the street : but I opened my doors to the traveller .
32 : 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said , I am young , and ye are very old ; wherefore I was afraid , and durst not shew you mine opinion .
33 : 3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart : and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly .
33 : 4 The spirit of God hath made me , and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life .
33 : 5 If thou canst answer me , set thy words in order before me , stand up .
for he giveth not account of any of his matters .
33 : 15 In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ; 33 : 16 Then he openeth the ears of men , and sealeth their instruction , 33 : 17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
33 : 18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
34 : 1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said , 34 : 2 Hear my words , O ye wise men ; and give ear unto me , ye that have knowledge .
34 : 9 For he hath said , It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God .
he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou knowest .
34 : 35 Job hath spoken without knowledge , and his words were without wisdom .
35 : 8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art ; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man .
35 : 15 But now , because it is not so , he hath visited in his anger ; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity : 35 : 16 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain ; he multiplieth words without knowledge .
36 : 1 Elihu also proceeded , and said , 36 : 2 Suffer me a little , and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God ' s behalf .
36 : 7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
36 : 14 They die in youth , and their life is among the unclean .
36 : 18 Because there is wrath , beware lest he take thee away with his stroke : then a great ransom cannot deliver thee .
no , not gold , nor all the forces of strength .
36 : 23 Who hath enjoined him his way ?
36 : 24 Remember that thou magnify his work , which men behold .
36 : 29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds , or the noise of his tabernacle ?
36 : 32 With clouds he covereth the light ; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt .
37 : 2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice , and the sound that goeth out of his mouth .
37 : 7 He sealeth up the hand of every man ; that all men may know his work .
37 : 9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind : and cold out of the north .
37 : 20 Shall it be told him that I speak ?
or who laid the corner stone thereof ; 38 : 7 When the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
38 : 9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof , and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it , 38 : 10 And brake up for it my decreed place , and set bars and doors , 38 : 11 And said , Hitherto shalt thou come , but no further : and here shall thy proud waves be stayed ?
38 : 18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth ?
or because the number of thy days is great ?
38 : 34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds , that abundance of waters may cover thee ?
or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve ?
39 : 4 Their young ones are in good liking , they grow up with corn ; they go forth , and return not unto them .
39 : 9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee , or abide by thy crib ?
39 : 19 Hast thou given the horse strength ?
hast thou clothed his neck with thunder ?
39 : 24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet .
39 : 28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock , and the strong place .
39 : 30 Her young ones also suck up blood : and where the slain are , there is she .
40 : 6 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind , and said , 40 : 7 Gird up thy loins now like a man : I will demand of thee , and declare thou unto me .
40 : 9 Hast thou an arm like God ?
40 : 14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee .
41 : 7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ?
or his head with fish spears ?
41 : 8 Lay thine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
or who can come to him with his double bridle ?
41 : 16 One is so near to another , that no air can come between them .
41 : 25 When he raiseth up himself , the mighty are afraid : by reason of breakings they purify themselves .
41 : 27 He esteemeth iron as straw , and brass as rotten wood .
41 : 33 Upon earth there is not his like , who is made without fear .
42 : 17 So Job died , being old and full of days .
2 : 2 The kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the LORD , and against his anointed , saying ,
2 : 4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh : the LORD shall have them in derision .
3 : 8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD : thy blessing is upon thy people .
5 : 10 Destroy thou them , O God ; let them fall by their own counsels ; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions ; for they have rebelled against thee .
7 : 5 Let the enemy persecute my soul , and take it ; yea , let him tread down my life upon the earth , and lay mine honour in the dust .
7 : 17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness : and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high .
9 : 5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen , thou hast destroyed the wicked , thou hast put out their name for ever and ever .
9 : 6 O thou enemy , destructions are come to a perpetual end : and thou hast destroyed cities ; their memorial is perished with them .
9 : 7 But the LORD shall endure for ever : he hath prepared his throne for judgment .
9 : 8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness , he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness .
9 : 9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed , a refuge in times of trouble .
9 : 13 Have mercy upon me , O LORD ; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me , thou that liftest me up from the gates of death :
9 : 16 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands .
Higgaion .
10 : 5 His ways are always grievous ; thy judgments are far above out of his sight : as for all his enemies , he puffeth at them .
10 : 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud : under his tongue is mischief and vanity .
10 : 14 Thou hast seen it ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite , to requite it with thy hand : the poor committeth himself unto thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless .
11 : 1 In the LORD put I my trust : how say ye to my soul , Flee as a bird to your mountain ?
12 : 7 Thou shalt keep them , O LORD , thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever .
12 : 8 The wicked walk on every side , when the vilest men are exalted .
how long wilt thou hide thy face from me ?
13 : 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul , having sorrow in my heart daily ?
who eat up my people as they eat bread , and call not upon the LORD .
14 : 5 There were they in great fear : for God is in the generation of the righteous .
15 : 2 He that walketh uprightly , and worketh righteousness , and speaketh the truth in his heart .
16 : 4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god : their drink offerings of blood will I not offer , nor take up their names into my lips .
16 : 9 Therefore my heart is glad , and my glory rejoiceth : my flesh also shall rest in hope .
16 : 11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life : in thy presence is fulness of joy ; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore .
17 : 6 I have called upon thee , for thou wilt hear me , O God : incline thine ear unto me , and hear my speech .
17 : 10 They are inclosed in their own fat : with their mouth they speak proudly .
17 : 12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey , and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places .
18 : 5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about : the snares of death prevented me .
18 : 7 Then the earth shook and trembled ; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken , because he was wroth .
18 : 16 He sent from above , he took me , he drew me out of many waters .
18 : 18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the LORD was my stay .
18 : 22 For all his judgments were before me , and I did not put away his statutes from me .
18 : 27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people ; but wilt bring down high looks .
18 : 32 It is God that girdeth me with strength , and maketh my way perfect .
18 : 45 The strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
19 : 3 There is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard .
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
19 : 8 The statutes of the LORD are right , rejoicing the heart : the commandment of the LORD is pure , enlightening the eyes .
cleanse thou me from secret faults .
20 : 1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble ; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee ;
20 : 2 Send thee help from the sanctuary , and strengthen thee out of Zion ;
20 : 9 Save , LORD : let the king hear us when we call .
21 : 13 Be thou exalted , LORD , in thine own strength : so will we sing and praise thy power .
why art thou so far from helping me , and from the words of my roaring ?
22 : 12 Many bulls have compassed me : strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round .
22 : 16 For dogs have compassed me : the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me : they pierced my hands and my feet .
22 : 19 But be not thou far from me , O LORD : O my strength , haste thee to help me .
22 : 31 They shall come , and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born , that he hath done this .
24 : 7 Lift up your heads , O ye gates ; and be ye lift up , ye everlasting doors ; and the King of glory shall come in .
24 : 8 Who is this King of glory ?
The LORD of hosts , he is the King of glory .
26 : 7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving , and tell of all thy wondrous works .
26 : 12 My foot standeth in an even place : in the congregations will I bless the LORD .
27 : 3 Though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will I be confident .
27 : 12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as breathe out cruelty .
27 : 13 I had fainted , unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living .
28 : 1 Unto thee will I cry , O LORD my rock ; be not silent to me : lest , if thou be silent to me , I become like them that go down into the pit .
29 : 1 Give unto the LORD , O ye mighty , give unto the LORD glory and strength .
29 : 7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire .
30 : 1 I will extol thee , O LORD ; for thou hast lifted me up , and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me .
30 : 5 For his anger endureth but a moment ; in his favour is life : weeping may endure for a night , but joy cometh in the morning .
30 : 6 And in my prosperity I said , I shall never be moved .
31 : 20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
32 : 4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me : my moisture is turned into the drought of summer .
32 : 5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee , and mine iniquity have I not hid .
Selah .
33 : 1 Rejoice in the LORD , O ye righteous : for praise is comely for the upright .
34 : 11 Come , ye children , hearken unto me : I will teach you the fear of the LORD .
34 : 13 Keep thy tongue from evil , and thy lips from speaking guile .
34 : 18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart ; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit .
34 : 22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants : and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate .
35 : 8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares ; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
35 : 9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD : it shall rejoice in his salvation .
35 : 13 But as for me , when they were sick , my clothing was sackcloth : I humbled my soul with fasting ; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom .
35 : 15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together : yea , the abjects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ceased not :
rescue my soul from their destructions , my darling from the lions .
35 : 22 This thou hast seen , O LORD : keep not silence : O Lord , be not far from me .
35 : 25 Let them not say in their hearts , Ah , so would we have it : let them not say , We have swallowed him up .
35 : 26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt : let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me .
36 : 4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed ; he setteth himself in a way that is not good ; he abhorreth not evil .
36 : 12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen : they are cast down , and shall not be able to rise .
37 : 4 Delight thyself also in the LORD : and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart .
37 : 8 Cease from anger , and forsake wrath : fret not thyself in any wise to do evil .
37 : 22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth ; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off .
37 : 26 He is ever merciful , and lendeth ; and his seed is blessed .
37 : 35 I have seen the wicked in great power , and spreading himself like a green bay tree .
38 : 3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger ; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin .
38 : 10 My heart panteth , my strength faileth me : as for the light of mine eyes , it also is gone from me .
38 : 18 For I will declare mine iniquity ; I will be sorry for my sin .
39 : 7 And now , Lord , what wait I for ?
39 : 9 I was dumb , I opened not my mouth ; because thou didst it .
39 : 10 Remove thy stroke away from me : I am consumed by the blow of thine hand .
39 : 11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity , thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth : surely every man is vanity .
40 : 7 Then said I , Lo , I come : in the volume of the book it is written of me ,
40 : 8 I delight to do thy will , O my God : yea , thy law is within my heart .
40 : 11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me , O LORD : let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me .
41 : 1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor : the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble .
41 : 9 Yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me .
42 : 1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks , so panteth my soul after thee , O God .
why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
42 : 11 Why art thou cast down , O my soul ?
44 : 2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand , and plantedst them ; how thou didst afflict the people , and cast them out .
44 : 4 Thou art my King , O God : command deliverances for Jacob .
44 : 10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy : and they which hate us spoil for themselves .
44 : 12 Thou sellest thy people for nought , and dost not increase thy wealth by their price .
44 : 18 Our heart is not turned back , neither have our steps declined from thy way ;
45 : 1 My heart is inditing a good matter : I speak of the things which I have made touching the king : my tongue is the pen of a ready writer .
45 : 4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness ; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things .
45 : 5 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king ' s enemies ; whereby the people fall under thee .
46 : 1 God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
46 : 4 There is a river , the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God , the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High .
46 : 7 The LORD of hosts is with us ; the God of Jacob is our refuge .
47 : 2 For the LORD most high is terrible ; he is a great King over all the earth .
Selah .
48 : 3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge .
Selah .
48 : 13 Mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces ; that ye may tell it to the generation following .
49 : 1 Hear this , all ye people ; give ear , all ye inhabitants of the world :
49 : 11 Their inward thought is , that their houses shall continue for ever , and their dwelling places to all generations ; they call their lands after their own names .
49 : 16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich , when the glory of his house is increased ;
49 : 18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul : and men will praise thee , when thou doest well to thyself .
50 : 5 Gather my saints together unto me ; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice .
50 : 9 I will take no bullock out of thy house , nor he goats out of thy folds .
50 : 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls , or drink the blood of goats ?
50 : 14 Offer unto God thanksgiving ; and pay thy vows unto the most High :
50 : 18 When thou sawest a thief , then thou consentedst with him , and hast been partaker with adulterers .
50 : 23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me : and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God .
51 : 7 Purge me with hyssop , and I shall be clean : wash me , and I shall be whiter than snow .
51 : 15 O Lord , open thou my lips ; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise .
51 : 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit : a broken and a contrite heart , O God , thou wilt not despise .
51 : 18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion : build thou the walls of Jerusalem .
the goodness of God endureth continually .
53 : 3 Every one of them is gone back : they are altogether become filthy ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
54 : 3 For strangers are risen up against me , and oppressors seek after my soul : they have not set God before them .
for then would I fly away , and be at rest .
55 : 13 But it was thou , a man mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
55 : 15 Let death seize upon them , and let them go down quick into hell : for wickedness is in their dwellings , and among them .
56 : 2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up : for they be many that fight against me , O thou most High .
56 : 13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death : wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living ?
57 : 5 Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens ; let thy glory be above all the earth .
57 : 6 They have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves .
Selah .
57 : 8 Awake up , my glory ; awake , psaltery and harp : I myself will awake early .
57 : 10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens , and thy truth unto the clouds .
do ye judge uprightly , O ye sons of men ?
58 : 3 The wicked are estranged from the womb : they go astray as soon as they be born , speaking lies .
58 : 5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers , charming never so wisely .
58 : 7 Let them melt away as waters which run continually : when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows , let them be as cut in pieces .
59 : 3 For , lo , they lie in wait for my soul : the mighty are gathered against me ; not for my transgression , nor for my sin , O LORD .
59 : 17 Unto thee , O my strength , will I sing : for God is my defence , and the God of my mercy .
Selah .
60 : 12 Through God we shall do valiantly : for he it is that shall tread down our enemies .
61 : 4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever : I will trust in the covert of thy wings .
62 : 7 In God is my salvation and my glory : the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
62 : 10 Trust not in oppression , and become not vain in robbery : if riches increase , set not your heart upon them .
63 : 1 O God , thou art my God ; early will I seek thee : my soul thirsteth for thee , my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land , where no water is ;
63 : 2 To see thy power and thy glory , so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary .
64 : 4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect : suddenly do they shoot at him , and fear not .
65 : 10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly : thou settlest the furrows thereof : thou makest it soft with showers : thou blessest the springing thereof .
Selah .
66 : 5 Come and see the works of God : he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men .
66 : 7 He ruleth by his power for ever ; his eyes behold the nations : let not the rebellious exalt themselves .
Selah .
66 : 14 Which my lips have uttered , and my mouth hath spoken , when I was in trouble .
67 : 3 Let the people praise thee , O God ; let all the people praise thee .
67 : 7 God shall bless us ; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him .
68 : 1 Let God arise , let his enemies be scattered : let them also that hate him flee before him .
68 : 7 O God , when thou wentest forth before thy people , when thou didst march through the wilderness ; Selah :
68 : 10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein : thou , O God , hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor .
68 : 14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it , it was white as snow in Salmon .
68 : 26 Bless ye God in the congregations , even the Lord , from the fountain of Israel .
68 : 34 Ascribe ye strength unto God : his excellency is over Israel , and his strength is in the clouds .
68 : 35 O God , thou art terrible out of thy holy places : the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people .
69 : 2 I sink in deep mire , where there is no standing : I am come into deep waters , where the floods overflow me .
69 : 4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enemies wrongfully , are mighty : then I restored that which I took not away .
69 : 9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up ; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me .
69 : 10 When I wept , and chastened my soul with fasting , that was to my reproach .
69 : 18 Draw nigh unto my soul , and redeem it : deliver me because of mine enemies .
69 : 21 They gave me also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink .
70 : 3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say , Aha , aha .
71 : 4 Deliver me , O my God , out of the hand of the wicked , out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man .
71 : 13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul ; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt .
72 : 4 He shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the needy , and shall break in pieces the oppressor .
72 : 7 In his days shall the righteous flourish ; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth .
72 : 13 He shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the souls of the needy .
72 : 16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
72 : 20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended .
73 : 7 Their eyes stand out with fatness : they have more than heart could wish .
73 : 12 Behold , these are the ungodly , who prosper in the world ; they increase in riches .
73 : 14 For all the day long have I been plagued , and chastened every morning .
they are utterly consumed with terrors .
73 : 25 Whom have I in heaven but thee ?
73 : 26 My flesh and my heart faileth : but God is the strength of my heart , and my portion for ever .
why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture ?
74 : 9 We see not our signs : there is no more any prophet : neither is there among us any that knoweth how long .
74 : 23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies : the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually .
75 : 1 Unto thee , O God , do we give thanks , unto thee do we give thanks : for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare .
Selah .
77 : 3 I remembered God , and was troubled : I complained , and my spirit was overwhelmed .
77 : 5 I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times .
hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies ?
Selah .
77 : 17 The clouds poured out water : the skies sent out a sound : thine arrows also went abroad .
78 : 3 Which we have heard and known , and our fathers have told us .
78 : 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a law in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children :
78 : 16 He brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers .
78 : 17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness .
78 : 21 Therefore the LORD heard this , and was wroth : so a fire was kindled against Jacob , and anger also came up against Israel ;
78 : 25 Man did eat angels ' food : he sent them meat to the full .
78 : 28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp , round about their habitations .
78 : 34 When he slew them , then they sought him : and they returned and enquired early after God .
78 : 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger , wrath , and indignation , and trouble , by sending evil angels among them .
78 : 57 But turned back , and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers : they were turned aside like a deceitful bow .
78 : 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their graven images .
78 : 61 And delivered his strength into captivity , and his glory into the enemy ' s hand .
78 : 68 But chose the tribe of Judah , the mount Zion which he loved .
78 : 71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people , and Israel his inheritance .
79 : 1 O God , the heathen are come into thine inheritance ; thy holy temple have they defiled ; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps .
79 : 12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach , wherewith they have reproached thee , O Lord .
80 : 10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it , and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars .
80 : 18 So will not we go back from thee : quicken us , and we will call upon thy name .
80 : 19 Turn us again , O LORD God of hosts , cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
81 : 1 Sing aloud unto God our strength : make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob .
81 : 2 Take a psalm , and bring hither the timbrel , the pleasant harp with the psaltery .
Selah .
81 : 11 But my people would not hearken to my voice ; and Israel would none of me .
81 : 16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat : and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee .
82 : 4 Deliver the poor and needy : rid them out of the hand of the wicked .
82 : 6 I have said , Ye are gods ; and all of you are children of the most High .
82 : 7 But ye shall die like men , and fall like one of the princes .
83 : 6 The tabernacles of Edom , and the Ishmaelites ; of Moab , and the Hagarenes ;
Selah .
84 : 5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee ; in whose heart are the ways of them .
Selah .
85 : 9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him ; that glory may dwell in our land .
86 : 7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee : for thou wilt answer me .
86 : 15 But thou , O Lord , art a God full of compassion , and gracious , long suffering , and plenteous in mercy and truth .
87 : 2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob .
87 : 7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there : all my springs are in thee .
88 : 3 For my soul is full of troubles : and my life draweth nigh unto the grave .
88 : 4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit : I am as a man that hath no strength :
88 : 9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction : LORD , I have called daily upon thee , I have stretched out my hands unto thee .
shall the dead arise and praise thee ?
Selah .
88 : 12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark ?
88 : 17 They came round about me daily like water ; they compassed me about together .
89 : 6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD ?
89 : 16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day : and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted .
89 : 19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one , and saidst , I have laid help upon one that is mighty ; I have exalted one chosen out of the people .
89 : 20 I have found David my servant ; with my holy oil have I anointed him :
89 : 22 The enemy shall not exact upon him ; nor the son of wickedness afflict him .
89 : 39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant : thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground .
89 : 41 All that pass by the way spoil him : he is a reproach to his neighbours .
89 : 42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries ; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice .
89 : 48 What man is he that liveth , and shall not see death ?
90 : 3 Thou turnest man to destruction ; and sayest , Return , ye children of men .
90 : 6 In the morning it flourisheth , and groweth up ; in the evening it is cut down , and withereth .
90 : 11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger ?
90 : 14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy ; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
91 : 13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet .
91 : 16 With long life will I satisfy him , and shew him my salvation .
92 : 4 For thou , LORD , hast made me glad through thy work : I will triumph in the works of thy hands .
and thy thoughts are very deep .
92 : 7 When the wicked spring as the grass , and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish ; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever :
92 : 10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn : I shall be anointed with fresh oil .
93 : 3 The floods have lifted up , O LORD , the floods have lifted up their voice ; the floods lift up their waves .
94 : 7 Yet they say , The LORD shall not see , neither shall the God of Jacob regard it .
94 : 14 For the LORD will not cast off his people , neither will he forsake his inheritance .
94 : 17 Unless the LORD had been my help , my soul had almost dwelt in silence .
94 : 20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee , which frameth mischief by a law ?
94 : 21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood .
94 : 22 But the LORD is my defence ; and my God is the rock of my refuge .
95 : 2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving , and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms .
95 : 5 The sea is his , and he made it : and his hands formed the dry land .
95 : 9 When your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my work .
96 : 12 Let the field be joyful , and all that is therein : then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
97 : 1 The LORD reigneth ; let the earth rejoice ; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof .
97 : 10 Ye that love the LORD , hate evil : he preserveth the souls of his saints ; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked .
97 : 11 Light is sown for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart .
98 : 7 Let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
99 : 1 The LORD reigneth ; let the people tremble : he sitteth between the cherubims ; let the earth be moved .
99 : 5 Exalt ye the LORD our God , and worship at his footstool ; for he is holy .
100 : 1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD , all ye lands .
101 : 3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes : I hate the work of them that turn aside ; it shall not cleave to me .
101 : 7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house : he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight .
102 : 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness : I am like an owl of the desert .
102 : 16 When the LORD shall build up Zion , he shall appear in his glory .
102 : 25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth : and the heavens are the work of thy hands .
102 : 26 They shall perish , but thou shalt endure : yea , all of them shall wax old like a garment ; as a vesture shalt thou change them , and they shall be changed :
103 : 7 He made known his ways unto Moses , his acts unto the children of Israel .
103 : 9 He will not always chide : neither will he keep his anger for ever .
103 : 12 As far as the east is from the west , so far hath he removed our transgressions from us .
104 : 4 Who maketh his angels spirits ; his ministers a flaming fire :
104 : 18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats ; and the rocks for the conies .
104 : 20 Thou makest darkness , and it is night : wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth .
104 : 24 O LORD , how manifold are thy works !
Bless thou the LORD , O my soul .
105 : 5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done ; his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth ;
105 : 6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant , ye children of Jacob his chosen .
105 : 8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations .
105 : 12 When they were but a few men in number ; yea , very few , and strangers in it .
105 : 21 He made him lord of his house , and ruler of all his substance :
105 : 27 They shewed his signs among them , and wonders in the land of Ham .
105 : 42 For he remembered his holy promise , and Abraham his servant .
105 : 45 That they might observe his statutes , and keep his laws .
106 : 4 Remember me , O LORD , with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people : O visit me with thy salvation ;
106 : 5 That I may see the good of thy chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation , that I may glory with thine inheritance .
106 : 8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name ' s sake , that he might make his mighty power to be known .
106 : 12 Then believed they his words ; they sang his praise .
106 : 23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them , had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , lest he should destroy them .
106 : 32 They angered him also at the waters of strife , so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes :
106 : 35 But were mingled among the heathen , and learned their works .
106 : 40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people , insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance .
107 : 4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way ; they found no city to dwell in .
107 : 8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
107 : 19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble , and he saveth them out of their distresses .
107 : 26 They mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths : their soul is melted because of trouble .
107 : 36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell , that they may prepare a city for habitation ;
107 : 39 Again , they are minished and brought low through oppression , affliction , and sorrow .
107 : 43 Whoso is wise , and will observe these things , even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD .
108 : 4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens : and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds .
108 : 5 Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens : and thy glory above all the earth ;
109 : 5 And they have rewarded me evil for good , and hatred for my love .
109 : 6 Set thou a wicked man over him : and let Satan stand at his right hand .
109 : 12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him : neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children .
109 : 27 That they may know that this is thy hand ; that thou , LORD , hast done it .
110 : 7 He shall drink of the brook in the way : therefore shall he lift up the head .
112 : 2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth : the generation of the upright shall be blessed .
112 : 10 The wicked shall see it , and be grieved ; he shall gnash with his teeth , and melt away : the desire of the wicked shall perish .
114 : 2 Judah was his sanctuary , and Israel his dominion .
114 : 3 The sea saw it , and fled : Jordan was driven back .
115 : 13 He will bless them that fear the LORD , both small and great .
115 : 16 The heaven , even the heavens , are the LORD ' s : but the earth hath he given to the children of men .
Praise the LORD .
116 : 13 I will take the cup of salvation , and call upon the name of the LORD .
116 : 19 In the courts of the LORD ' s house , in the midst of thee , O Jerusalem .
Praise ye the LORD .
118 : 1 O give thanks unto the LORD ; for he is good : because his mercy endureth for ever .
118 : 8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man .
118 : 9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes .
118 : 26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD : we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD .
119 : 7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart , when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments .
119 : 11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart , that I might not sin against thee .
119 : 12 Blessed art thou , O LORD : teach me thy statutes .
119 : 30 I have chosen the way of truth : thy judgments have I laid before me .
119 : 31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies : O LORD , put me not to shame .
119 : 47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments , which I have loved .
119 : 67 Before I was afflicted I went astray : but now have I kept thy word .
119 : 98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies : for they are ever with me .
119 : 104 Through thy precepts I get understanding : therefore I hate every false way .
119 : 120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee ; and I am afraid of thy judgments .
119 : 122 Be surety for thy servant for good : let not the proud oppress me .
119 : 124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy , and teach me thy statutes .
119 : 128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right ; and I hate every false way .
119 : 129 Thy testimonies are wonderful : therefore doth my soul keep them .
119 : 152 Concerning thy testimonies , I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever .
119 : 155 Salvation is far from the wicked : for they seek not thy statutes .
119 : 156 Great are thy tender mercies , O LORD : quicken me according to thy judgments .
120 : 7 I am for peace : but when I speak , they are for war .
121 : 1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills , from whence cometh my help .
123 : 1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes , O thou that dwellest in the heavens .
124 : 4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us , the stream had gone over our soul :
125 : 4 Do good , O LORD , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts .
127 : 4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man ; so are children of the youth .
128 : 2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands : happy shalt thou be , and it shall be well with thee .
128 : 4 Behold , that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD .
128 : 5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion : and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life .
129 : 7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand ; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom .
129 : 8 Neither do they which go by say , The blessing of the LORD be upon you : we bless you in the name of the LORD .
130 : 2 Lord , hear my voice : let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications .
130 : 8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities .
132 : 3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house , nor go up into my bed ;
132 : 14 This is my rest for ever : here will I dwell ; for I have desired it .
132 : 16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation : and her saints shall shout aloud for joy .
132 : 17 There will I make the horn of David to bud : I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed .
133 : 3 As the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion : for there the LORD commanded the blessing , even life for evermore .
135 : 2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD , in the courts of the house of our God .
135 : 5 For I know that the LORD is great , and that our Lord is above all gods .
135 : 9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee , O Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his servants .
136 : 7 To him that made great lights : for his mercy endureth for ever :
136 : 14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it : for his mercy endureth for ever :
136 : 17 To him which smote great kings : for his mercy endureth for ever :
136 : 18 And slew famous kings : for his mercy endureth for ever :
136 : 19 Sihon king of the Amorites : for his mercy endureth for ever :
138 : 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee , O LORD , when they hear the words of thy mouth .
138 : 8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me : thy mercy , O LORD , endureth for ever : forsake not the works of thine own hands .
139 : 4 For there is not a word in my tongue , but , lo , O LORD , thou knowest it altogether .
139 : 7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit ?
139 : 9 If I take the wings of the morning , and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea ;
139 : 19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked , O God : depart from me therefore , ye bloody men .
139 : 21 Do not I hate them , O LORD , that hate thee ?
140 : 1 Deliver me , O LORD , from the evil man : preserve me from the violent man ;
140 : 3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent ; adders ' poison is under their lips .
140 : 5 The proud have hid a snare for me , and cords ; they have spread a net by the wayside ; they have set gins for me .
140 : 8 Grant not , O LORD , the desires of the wicked : further not his wicked device ; lest they exalt themselves .
140 : 13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name : the upright shall dwell in thy presence .
141 : 4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing , to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity : and let me not eat of their dainties .
143 : 1 Hear my prayer , O LORD , give ear to my supplications : in thy faithfulness answer me , and in thy righteousness .
143 : 8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
145 : 1 I will extol thee , my God , O king ; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever .
145 : 7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness , and shall sing of thy righteousness .
145 : 13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations .
145 : 20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him : but all the wicked will he destroy .
145 : 21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD : and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever .
Praise ye the LORD .
147 : 8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds , who prepareth rain for the earth , who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains .
147 : 10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse : he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man .
148 : 5 Let them praise the name of the LORD : for he commanded , and they were created .
148 : 11 Kings of the earth , and all people ; princes , and all judges of the earth :
Praise ye the LORD .
149 : 1 Praise ye the LORD .
149 : 3 Let them praise his name in the dance : let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp .
149 : 4 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people : he will beautify the meek with salvation .
149 : 5 Let the saints be joyful in glory : let them sing aloud upon their beds .
150 : 3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet : praise him with the psaltery and harp .
150 : 6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD .
Praise ye the LORD .
1 : 1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel ; 1 : 2 To know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ; 1 : 3 To receive the instruction of wisdom , justice , and judgment , and equity ; 1 : 4 To give subtilty to the simple , to the young man knowledge and discretion .
1 : 8 My son , hear the instruction of thy father , and forsake not the law of thy mother : 1 : 9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head , and chains about thy neck .
1 : 33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely , and shall be quiet from fear of evil .
3 : 13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom , and the man that getteth understanding .
3 : 25 Be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it cometh .
4 : 3 For I was my father ' s son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
4 : 5 Get wisdom , get understanding : forget it not ; neither decline from the words of my mouth .
4 : 16 For they sleep not , except they have done mischief ; and their sleep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall .
4 : 26 Ponder the path of thy feet , and let all thy ways be established .
5 : 7 Hear me now therefore , O ye children , and depart not from the words of my mouth .
5 : 14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly .
5 : 17 Let them be only thine own , and not strangers ' with thee .
5 : 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins .
6 : 9 How long wilt thou sleep , O sluggard ?
6 : 13 He winketh with his eyes , he speaketh with his feet , he teacheth with his fingers ; 6 : 14 Frowardness is in his heart , he deviseth mischief continually ; he soweth discord .
6 : 20 My son , keep thy father ' s commandment , and forsake not the law of thy mother : 6 : 21 Bind them continually upon thine heart , and tie them about thy neck .
6 : 23 For the commandment is a lamp ; and the law is light ; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life : 6 : 24 To keep thee from the evil woman , from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman .
6 : 28 Can one go upon hot coals , and his feet not be burned ?
6 : 30 Men do not despise a thief , if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry ; 6 : 31 But if he be found , he shall restore sevenfold ; he shall give all the substance of his house .
7 : 2 Keep my commandments , and live ; and my law as the apple of thine eye .
7 : 3 Bind them upon thy fingers , write them upon the table of thine heart .
7 : 11 ( She is loud and stubborn ; her feet abide not in her house : 7 : 12 Now is she without , now in the streets , and lieth in wait at every corner .)
7 : 25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways , go not astray in her paths .
8 : 3 She crieth at the gates , at the entry of the city , at the coming in at the doors .
8 : 7 For my mouth shall speak truth ; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips .
8 : 16 By me princes rule , and nobles , even all the judges of the earth .
8 : 23 I was set up from everlasting , from the beginning , or ever the earth was .
8 : 33 Hear instruction , and be wise , and refuse it not .
9 : 9 Give instruction to a wise man , and he will be yet wiser : teach a just man , and he will increase in learning .
9 : 13 A foolish woman is clamorous : she is simple , and knoweth nothing .
10 : 6 Blessings are upon the head of the just : but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked .
10 : 8 The wise in heart will receive commandments : but a prating fool shall fall .
10 : 12 Hatred stirreth up strifes : but love covereth all sins .
10 : 14 Wise men lay up knowledge : but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction .
10 : 19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin : but he that refraineth his lips is wise .
10 : 25 As the whirlwind passeth , so is the wicked no more : but the righteous is an everlasting foundation .
10 : 28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness : but the expectation of the wicked shall perish .
10 : 31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom : but the froward tongue shall be cut out .
10 : 32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable : but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness .
11 : 3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them : but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them .
11 : 9 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour : but through knowledge shall the just be delivered .
11 : 16 A gracious woman retaineth honour : and strong men retain riches .
11 : 19 As righteousness tendeth to life : so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death .
11 : 28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall ; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch .
12 : 8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom : but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised .
12 : 11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread : but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding .
12 : 25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop : but a good word maketh it glad .
13 : 2 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth : but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence .
13 : 4 The soul of the sluggard desireth , and hath nothing : but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat .
13 : 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge : but a fool layeth open his folly .
13 : 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise : but a companion of fools shall be destroyed .
13 : 23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor : but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment .
14 : 3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride : but the lips of the wise shall preserve them .
14 : 6 A scorner seeketh wisdom , and findeth it not : but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth .
14 : 9 Fools make a mock at sin : but among the righteous there is favour .
14 : 24 The crown of the wise is their riches : but the foolishness of fools is folly .
14 : 31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker : but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor .
15 : 6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure : but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble .
15 : 7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge : but the heart of the foolish doeth not so .
15 : 8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD : but the prayer of the upright is his delight .
15 : 17 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith .
15 : 19 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns : but the way of the righteous is made plain .
15 : 20 A wise son maketh a glad father : but a foolish man despiseth his mother .
15 : 24 The way of life is above to the wise , that he may depart from hell beneath .
15 : 28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer : but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things .
15 : 33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom ; and before honour is humility .
16 : 1 The preparations of the heart in man , and the answer of the tongue , is from the LORD .
16 : 17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil : he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul .
16 : 21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent : and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning .
16 : 24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb , sweet to the soul , and health to the bones .
16 : 27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil : and in his lips there is as a burning fire .
16 : 31 The hoary head is a crown of glory , if it be found in the way of righteousness .
17 : 7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool : much less do lying lips a prince .
17 : 23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment .
18 : 1 Through desire a man , having separated himself , seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom .
18 : 5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked , to overthrow the righteous in judgment .
18 : 8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly .
18 : 9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster .
18 : 10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower : the righteous runneth into it , and is safe .
18 : 11 The rich man ' s wealth is his strong city , and as an high wall in his own conceit .
18 : 16 A man ' s gift maketh room for him , and bringeth him before great men .
19 : 1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity , than he that is perverse in his lips , and is a fool .
he pursueth them with words , yet they are wanting to him .
19 : 16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul ; but he that despiseth his ways shall die .
19 : 29 Judgments are prepared for scorners , and stripes for the back of fools .
20 : 3 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife : but every fool will be meddling .
20 : 6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness : but a faithful man who can find ?
20 : 15 There is gold , and a multitude of rubies : but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel .
20 : 27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD , searching all the inward parts of the belly .
21 : 14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger : and a reward in the bosom strong wrath .
21 : 28 A false witness shall perish : but the man that heareth speaketh constantly .
22 : 1 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches , and loving favour rather than silver and gold .
22 : 17 Bow down thine ear , and hear the words of the wise , and apply thine heart unto my knowledge .
22 : 22 Rob not the poor , because he is poor : neither oppress the afflicted in the gate : 22 : 23 For the LORD will plead their cause , and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them .
he shall stand before kings ; he shall not stand before mean men .
23 : 3 Be not desirous of his dainties : for they are deceitful meat .
23 : 14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod , and shalt deliver his soul from hell .
23 : 20 Be not among winebibbers ; among riotous eaters of flesh : 23 : 21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty : and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags .
23 : 27 For a whore is a deep ditch ; and a strange woman is a narrow pit .
23 : 32 At the last it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder .
24 : 17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth , and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth : 24 : 18 Lest the LORD see it , and it displease him , and he turn away his wrath from him .
24 : 19 Fret not thyself because of evil men , neither be thou envious at the wicked : 24 : 20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man ; the candle of the wicked shall be put out .
It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment .
24 : 33 Yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep : 24 : 34 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth ; and thy want as an armed man .
25 : 2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing : but the honour of kings is to search out a matter .
26 : 11 As a dog returneth to his vomit , so a fool returneth to his folly .
26 : 17 He that passeth by , and meddleth with strife belonging not to him , is like one that taketh a dog by the ears .
26 : 24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips , and layeth up deceit within him ; 26 : 25 When he speaketh fair , believe him not : for there are seven abominations in his heart .
26 : 27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein : and he that rolleth a stone , it will return upon him .
27 : 5 Open rebuke is better than secret love .
27 : 10 Thine own friend , and thy father ' s friend , forsake not ; neither go into thy brother ' s house in the day of thy calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
28 : 1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth : but the righteous are bold as a lion .
28 : 4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked : but such as keep the law contend with them .
28 : 24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother , and saith , It is no transgression ; the same is the companion of a destroyer .
29 : 3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father : but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance .
29 : 13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together : the LORD lighteneth both their eyes .
29 : 15 The rod and reproof give wisdom : but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame .
29 : 16 When the wicked are multiplied , transgression increaseth : but the righteous shall see their fall .
29 : 23 A man ' s pride shall bring him low : but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit .
30 : 10 Accuse not a servant unto his master , lest he curse thee , and thou be found guilty .
31 : 2 What , my son ?
31 : 8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction .
31 : 16 She considereth a field , and buyeth it : with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard .
31 : 28 Her children arise up , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her .
Ecclesiastes
or
1 : 6 The wind goeth toward the south , and turneth about unto the north ; it whirleth about continually , and the wind returneth again according to his circuits .
1 : 10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said , See , this is new ?
1 : 16 I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
1 : 17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and folly : I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit .
2 : 10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them , I withheld not my heart from any joy ; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour : and this was my portion of all my labour .
even that which hath been already done .
2 : 14 The wise man ' s eyes are in his head ; but the fool walketh in darkness : and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all .
And how dieth the wise man ?
yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured , and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun .
This also is vanity and a great evil .
3 : 19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth , so dieth the other ; yea , they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast : for all is vanity .
This is also vanity , yea , it is a sore travail .
5 : 6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin ; neither say thou before the angel , that it was an error : wherefore should God be angry at thy voice , and destroy the work of thine hands ?
5 : 13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun , namely , riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt .
5 : 15 As he came forth of his mother ' s womb , naked shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
5 : 20 For he shall not much remember the days of his life ; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart .
6 : 12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life , all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow ?
7 : 5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
7 : 6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool : this also is vanity .
7 : 19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city .
8 : 4 Where the word of a king is , there is power : and who may say unto him , What doest thou ?
9 : 7 Go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for God now accepteth thy works .
9 : 8 Let thy garments be always white ; and let thy head lack no ointment .
9 : 12 For man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare ; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon them .
10 : 11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment ; and a babbler is no better .
11 : 6 In the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not thine hand : for thou knowest not whether shall prosper , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
12 : 10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words : and that which was written was upright , even words of truth .
12 : 11 The words of the wise are as goads , and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies , which are given from one shepherd .
12 : 12 And further , by these , my son , be admonished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
The Song of Solomon
1 : 4 Draw me , we will run after thee : the king hath brought me into his chambers : we will be glad and rejoice in thee , we will remember thy love more than wine : the upright love thee .
1 : 5 I am black , but comely , O ye daughters of Jerusalem , as the tents of Kedar , as the curtains of Solomon .
2 : 14 O my dove , that art in the clefts of the rock , in the secret places of the stairs , let me see thy countenance , let me hear thy voice ; for sweet is thy voice , and thy countenance is comely .
2 : 15 Take us the foxes , the little foxes , that spoil the vines : for our vines have tender grapes .
2 : 16 My beloved is mine , and I am his : he feedeth among the lilies .
3 : 6 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all powders of the merchant ?
3 : 8 They all hold swords , being expert in war : every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night .
4 : 1 Behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast doves ' eyes within thy locks : thy hair is as a flock of goats , that appear from mount Gilead .
4 : 3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet , and thy speech is comely : thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks .
4 : 7 Thou art all fair , my love ; there is no spot in thee .
4 : 11 Thy lips , O my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under thy tongue ; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
5 : 3 I have put off my coat ; how shall I put it on ?
5 : 7 The watchmen that went about the city found me , they smote me , they wounded me ; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me .
5 : 12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters , washed with milk , and fitly set .
5 : 13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices , as sweet flowers : his lips like lilies , dropping sweet smelling myrrh .
5 : 15 His legs are as pillars of marble , set upon sockets of fine gold : his countenance is as Lebanon , excellent as the cedars .
6 : 4 Thou art beautiful , O my love , as Tirzah , comely as Jerusalem , terrible as an army with banners .
6 : 10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as an army with banners ?
7 : 11 Come , my beloved , let us go forth into the field ; let us lodge in the villages .
8 : 13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens , the companions hearken to thy voice : cause me to hear it .
1 : 3 The ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master ' s crib : but Israel doth not know , my people doth not consider .
1 : 8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
1 : 10 Hear the word of the LORD , ye rulers of Sodom ; give ear unto the law of our God , ye people of Gomorrah .
1 : 15 And when ye spread forth your hands , I will hide mine eyes from you : yea , when ye make many prayers , I will not hear : your hands are full of blood .
1 : 21 How is the faithful city become an harlot !
1 : 24 Therefore saith the LORD , the LORD of hosts , the mighty One of Israel , Ah , I will ease me of mine adversaries , and avenge me of mine enemies : 1 : 25 And I will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away thy dross , and take away all thy tin : 1 : 26 And I will restore thy judges as at the first , and thy counsellors as at the beginning : afterward thou shalt be called , The city of righteousness , the faithful city .
2 : 3 And many people shall go and say , Come ye , and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD , to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways , and we will walk in his paths : for out of Zion shall go forth the law , and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem .
2 : 17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day .
3 : 8 For Jerusalem is ruined , and Judah is fallen : because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD , to provoke the eyes of his glory .
for they have rewarded evil unto themselves .
3 : 13 The LORD standeth up to plead , and standeth to judge the people .
3 : 16 Moreover the LORD saith , Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes , walking and mincing as they go , and making a tinkling with their feet : 3 : 17 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion , and the LORD will discover their secret parts .
3 : 24 And it shall come to pass , that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink ; and instead of a girdle a rent ; and instead of well set hair baldness ; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth ; and burning instead of beauty .
4 : 6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat , and for a place of refuge , and for a covert from storm and from rain .
5 : 5 And now go to ; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard : I will take away the hedge thereof , and it shall be eaten up ; and break down the wall thereof , and it shall be trodden down : 5 : 6 And I will lay it waste : it shall not be pruned , nor digged ; but there shall come up briers and thorns : I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it .
5 : 9 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts , Of a truth many houses shall be desolate , even great and fair , without inhabitant .
6 : 4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
for I am undone ; because I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for mine eyes have seen the King , the LORD of hosts .
7 : 1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up toward Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
7 : 9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah ' s son .
7 : 14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign ; Behold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name Immanuel .
7 : 19 And they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes .
7 : 20 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired , namely , by them beyond the river , by the king of Assyria , the head , and the hair of the feet : and it shall also consume the beard .
7 : 21 And it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall nourish a young cow , and two sheep ; 7 : 22 And it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
8 : 18 Behold , I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts , which dwelleth in mount Zion .
for the living to the dead ?
8 : 21 And they shall pass through it , hardly bestead and hungry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves , and curse their king and their God , and look upward .
8 : 22 And they shall look unto the earth ; and behold trouble and darkness , dimness of anguish ; and they shall be driven to darkness .
9 : 2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light : they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death , upon them hath the light shined .
9 : 13 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them , neither do they seek the LORD of hosts .
9 : 20 And he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm : 9 : 21 Manasseh , Ephraim ; and Ephraim , Manasseh : and they together shall be against Judah .
10 : 3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ?
to whom will ye flee for help ?
and where will ye leave your glory ?
10 : 4 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the slain .
10 : 22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea , yet a remnant of them shall return : the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness .
11 : 6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb , and the leopard shall lie down with the kid ; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together ; and a little child shall lead them .
11 : 9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD , as the waters cover the sea .
13 : 2 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain , exalt the voice unto them , shake the hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
13 : 22 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses , and dragons in their pleasant palaces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged .
14 : 20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial , because thou hast destroyed thy land , and slain thy people : the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned .
14 : 22 For I will rise up against them , saith the LORD of hosts , and cut off from Babylon the name , and remnant , and son , and nephew , saith the LORD .
15 : 6 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate : for the hay is withered away , the grass faileth , there is no green thing .
15 : 7 Therefore the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away to the brook of the willows .
17 : 3 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , saith the LORD of hosts .
17 : 4 And in that day it shall come to pass , that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean .
17 : 12 Woe to the multitude of many people , which make a noise like the noise of the seas ; and to the rushing of nations , that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters !
17 : 14 And behold at eveningtide trouble ; and before the morning he is not .
19 : 6 And they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up : the reeds and flags shall wither .
and let them tell thee now , and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt .
19 : 13 The princes of Zoan are become fools , the princes of Noph are deceived ; they have also seduced Egypt , even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof .
19 : 14 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof : and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof , as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit .
19 : 19 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD .
19 : 23 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria , and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians .
19 : 24 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria , even a blessing in the midst of the land : 19 : 25 Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless , saying , Blessed be Egypt my people , and Assyria the work of my hands , and Israel mine inheritance .
21 : 1 The burden of the desert of the sea .
21 : 5 Prepare the table , watch in the watchtower , eat , drink : arise , ye princes , and anoint the shield .
And he answered and said , Babylon is fallen , is fallen ; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground .
Watchman , what of the night ?
What aileth thee now , that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops ?
22 : 8 And he discovered the covering of Judah , and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest .
22 : 10 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall .
22 : 14 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts , Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die , saith the Lord GOD of hosts .
22 : 25 In that day , saith the LORD of hosts , shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off : for the LORD hath spoken it .
Howl , ye ships of Tarshish ; for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in : from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them .
23 : 6 Pass ye over to Tarshish ; howl , ye inhabitants of the isle .
23 : 8 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre , the crowning city , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth ?
23 : 11 He stretched out his hand over the sea , he shook the kingdoms : the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city , to destroy the strong holds thereof .
23 : 13 Behold the land of the Chaldeans ; this people was not , till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness : they set up the towers thereof , they raised up the palaces thereof ; and he brought it to ruin .
23 : 15 And it shall come to pass in that day , that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king : after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot .
23 : 16 Take an harp , go about the city , thou harlot that hast been forgotten ; make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembered .
24 : 3 The land shall be utterly emptied , and utterly spoiled : for the LORD hath spoken this word .
24 : 21 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
24 : 22 And they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
25 : 8 He will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the LORD hath spoken it .
25 : 10 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest , and Moab shall be trodden down under him , even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill .
and whom shall he make to understand doctrine ?
28 : 19 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
28 : 29 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts , which is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in working .
add ye year to year ; let them kill sacrifices .
29 : 2 Yet I will distress Ariel , and there shall be heaviness and sorrow : and it shall be unto me as Ariel .
29 : 5 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
29 : 7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , even all that fight against her and her munition , and that distress her , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
29 : 13 Wherefore the Lord said , Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth , and with their lips do honour me , but have removed their heart far from me , and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men : 29 : 14 Therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people , even a marvellous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
29 : 16 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter ' s clay : for shall the work say of him that made it , He made me not ?
29 : 23 But when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
30 : 5 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them , nor be an help nor profit , but a shame , and also a reproach .
30 : 14 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters ' vessel that is broken in pieces ; he shall not spare : so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth , or to take water withal out of the pit .
30 : 23 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed , that thou shalt sow the ground withal ; and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shall be fat and plenteous : in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures .
30 : 27 Behold , the name of the LORD cometh from far , burning with his anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a devouring fire : 30 : 28 And his breath , as an overflowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity : and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people , causing them to err .
30 : 30 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard , and shall shew the lighting down of his arm , with the indignation of his anger , and with the flame of a devouring fire , with scattering , and tempest , and hailstones .
31 : 6 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted .
32 : 1 Behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in judgment .
32 : 6 For the vile person will speak villany , and his heart will work iniquity , to practise hypocrisy , and to utter error against the LORD , to make empty the soul of the hungry , and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail .
32 : 7 The instruments also of the churl are evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
32 : 8 But the liberal deviseth liberal things ; and by liberal things shall he stand .
32 : 9 Rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye careless daughters ; give ear unto my speech .
32 : 12 They shall lament for the teats , for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
33 : 11 Ye shall conceive chaff , ye shall bring forth stubble : your breath , as fire , shall devour you .
33 : 17 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty : they shall behold the land that is very far off .
33 : 21 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams ; wherein shall go no galley with oars , neither shall gallant ship pass thereby .
34 : 11 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it ; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion , and the stones of emptiness .
36 : 1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah , and took them .
36 : 11 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh , Speak , I pray thee , unto thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to us in the Jews ' language , in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
36 : 18 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , the LORD will deliver us .
where are the gods of Sepharvaim ?
37 : 1 And it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the LORD .
37 : 3 And they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
37 : 5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
37 : 7 Behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
37 : 15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD , saying , 37 : 16 O LORD of hosts , God of Israel , that dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the God , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made heaven and earth .
37 : 26 Hast thou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ?
37 : 35 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake , and for my servant David ' s sake .
38 : 15 What shall I say ?
38 : 16 O LORD , by these things men live , and in all these things is the life of my spirit : so wilt thou recover me , and make me to live .
40 : 20 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image , that shall not be moved .
41 : 4 Who hath wrought and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ?
41 : 12 Thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them , even them that contended with thee : they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
yea , there is none that sheweth , yea , there is none that declareth , yea , there is none that heareth your words .
41 : 29 Behold , they are all vanity ; their works are nothing : their molten images are wind and confusion .
42 : 8 I am the LORD : that is my name : and my glory will I not give to another , neither my praise to graven images .
42 : 9 Behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare : before they spring forth I tell you of them .
42 : 13 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
42 : 14 I have long time holden my peace ; I have been still , and refrained myself : now will I cry like a travailing woman ; I will destroy and devour at once .
42 : 17 They shall be turned back , they shall be greatly ashamed , that trust in graven images , that say to the molten images , Ye are our gods .
42 : 18 Hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
42 : 19 Who is blind , but my servant ?
43 : 1 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , O Israel , Fear not : for I have redeemed thee , I have called thee by thy name ; thou art mine .
43 : 12 I have declared , and have saved , and I have shewed , when there was no strange god among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , saith the LORD , that I am God .
43 : 16 Thus saith the LORD , which maketh a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ; 43 : 17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse , the army and the power ; they shall lie down together , they shall not rise : they are extinct , they are quenched as tow .
43 : 19 Behold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ?
43 : 24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
44 : 6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel , and his redeemer the LORD of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and beside me there is no God .
and the things that are coming , and shall come , let them shew unto them .
44 : 23 Sing , O ye heavens ; for the LORD hath done it : shout , ye lower parts of the earth : break forth into singing , ye mountains , O forest , and every tree therein : for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob , and glorified himself in Israel .
45 : 10 Woe unto him that saith unto his father , What begettest thou ?
45 : 13 I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will direct all his ways : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my captives , not for price nor reward , saith the LORD of hosts .
45 : 22 Look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for I am God , and there is none else .
46 : 2 They stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into captivity .
47 : 3 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered , yea , thy shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and I will not meet thee as a man .
47 : 13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels .
49 : 1 Listen , O isles , unto me ; and hearken , ye people , from far ; The LORD hath called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name .
49 : 7 Thus saith the LORD , the Redeemer of Israel , and his Holy One , to him whom man despiseth , to him whom the nation abhorreth , to a servant of rulers , Kings shall see and arise , princes also shall worship , because of the LORD that is faithful , and the Holy One of Israel , and he shall choose thee .
49 : 11 And I will make all my mountains a way , and my highways shall be exalted .
49 : 12 Behold , these shall come from far : and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sinim .
49 : 16 Behold , I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands ; thy walls are continually before me .
and who hath brought up these ?
or have I no power to deliver ?
50 : 4 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned .
50 : 7 For the Lord GOD will help me ; therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
50 : 10 Who is among you that feareth the LORD , that obeyeth the voice of his servant , that walketh in darkness , and hath no light ?
50 : 11 Behold , all ye that kindle a fire , that compass yourselves about with sparks : walk in the light of your fire , and in the sparks that ye have kindled .
This shall ye have of mine hand ; ye shall lie down in sorrow .
51 : 3 For the LORD shall comfort Zion : he will comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of the LORD ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
51 : 4 Hearken unto me , my people ; and give ear unto me , O my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
52 : 7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace ; that bringeth good tidings of good , that publisheth salvation ; that saith unto Zion , Thy God reigneth !
52 : 13 Behold , my servant shall deal prudently , he shall be exalted and extolled , and be very high .
53 : 3 He is despised and rejected of men ; a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief : and we hid as it were our faces from him ; he was despised , and we esteemed him not .
53 : 7 He was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth .
53 : 8 He was taken from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare his generation ?
54 : 4 Fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou confounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more .
54 : 7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee ; but with great mercies will I gather thee .
54 : 9 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me : for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth ; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
55 : 13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree , and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to the LORD for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off .
56 : 1 Thus saith the LORD , Keep ye judgment , and do justice : for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
57 : 4 Against whom do ye sport yourselves ?
57 : 21 There is no peace , saith my God , to the wicked .
Behold , in the day of your fast ye find pleasure , and exact all your labours .
59 : 14 And judgment is turned away backward , and justice standeth afar off : for truth is fallen in the street , and equity cannot enter .
59 : 16 And he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his arm brought salvation unto him ; and his righteousness , it sustained him .
60 : 4 Lift up thine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side .
60 : 5 Then thou shalt see , and flow together , and thine heart shall fear , and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee , the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee .
60 : 15 Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated , so that no man went through thee , I will make thee an eternal excellency , a joy of many generations .
60 : 20 Thy sun shall no more go down ; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself : for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of thy mourning shall be ended .
61 : 4 And they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
61 : 8 For I the LORD love judgment , I hate robbery for burnt offering ; and I will direct their work in truth , and I will make an everlasting covenant with them .
61 : 10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD , my soul shall be joyful in my God ; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation , he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness , as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments , and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels .
62 : 3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God .
62 : 5 For as a young man marrieth a virgin , so shall thy sons marry thee : and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride , so shall thy God rejoice over thee .
62 : 8 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies ; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine , for the which thou hast laboured : 62 : 9 But they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the LORD ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness .
62 : 11 Behold , the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world , Say ye to the daughter of Zion , Behold , thy salvation cometh ; behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
63 : 8 For he said , Surely they are my people , children that will not lie : so he was their Saviour .
are they restrained ?
64 : 4 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard , nor perceived by the ear , neither hath the eye seen , O God , beside thee , what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him .
65 : 1 I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , Behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
65 : 15 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen : for the Lord GOD shall slay thee , and call his servants by another name : 65 : 16 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from mine eyes .
65 : 17 For , behold , I create new heavens and a new earth : and the former shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , saith the LORD .
who hath seen such things ?
saith the LORD : shall I cause to bring forth , and shut the womb ?
66 : 18 For I know their works and their thoughts : it shall come , that I will gather all nations and tongues ; and they shall come , and see my glory .
1 : 6 Then said I , Ah , Lord GOD !
1 : 7 But the LORD said unto me , Say not , I am a child : for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee , and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak .
1 : 9 Then the LORD put forth his hand , and touched my mouth .
1 : 17 Thou therefore gird up thy loins , and arise , and speak unto them all that I command thee : be not dismayed at their faces , lest I confound thee before them .
1 : 18 For , behold , I have made thee this day a defenced city , and an iron pillar , and brasen walls against the whole land , against the kings of Judah , against the princes thereof , against the priests thereof , and against the people of the land .
2 : 4 Hear ye the word of the LORD , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel : 2 : 5 Thus saith the LORD , What iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ?
but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit .
2 : 20 For of old time I have broken thy yoke , and burst thy bands ; and thou saidst , I will not transgress ; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest , playing the harlot .
let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble : for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods , O Judah .
yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways .
2 : 36 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way ?
In the ways hast thou sat for them , as the Arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness .
3 : 8 And I saw , when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not , but went and played the harlot also .
3 : 14 Turn , O backsliding children , saith the LORD ; for I am married unto you : and I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion : 3 : 15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart , which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
3 : 19 But I said , How shall I put thee among the children , and give thee a pleasant land , a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations ?
3 : 24 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth ; their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
4 : 5 Declare ye in Judah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , Blow ye the trumpet in the land : cry , gather together , and say , Assemble yourselves , and let us go into the defenced cities .
4 : 8 For this gird you with sackcloth , lament and howl : for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us .
4 : 15 For a voice declareth from Dan , and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim .
4 : 18 Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee ; this is thy wickedness , because it is bitter , because it reacheth unto thine heart .
4 : 23 I beheld the earth , and , lo , it was without form , and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
4 : 24 I beheld the mountains , and , lo , they trembled , and all the hills moved lightly .
4 : 30 And when thou art spoiled , what wilt thou do ?
thou hast stricken them , but they have not grieved ; thou hast consumed them , but they have refused to receive correction : they have made their faces harder than a rock ; they have refused to return .
5 : 10 Go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her battlements ; for they are not the LORD ' s .
5 : 24 Neither say they in their heart , Let us now fear the LORD our God , that giveth rain , both the former and the latter , in his season : he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest .
5 : 26 For among my people are found wicked men : they lay wait , as he that setteth snares ; they set a trap , they catch men .
5 : 29 Shall I not visit for these things ?
saith the LORD : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
6 : 21 Therefore thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will lay stumblingblocks before this people , and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them ; the neighbour and his friend shall perish .
6 : 23 They shall lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roareth like the sea ; and they ride upon horses , set in array as men for war against thee , O daughter of Zion .
6 : 26 O daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and wallow thyself in ashes : make thee mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lamentation : for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us .
6 : 28 They are all grievous revolters , walking with slanders : they are brass and iron ; they are all corrupters .
7 : 16 Therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them , neither make intercession to me : for I will not hear thee .
7 : 20 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place , upon man , and upon beast , and upon the trees of the field , and upon the fruit of the ground ; and it shall burn , and shall not be quenched .
7 : 21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices , and eat flesh .
7 : 29 Cut off thine hair , O Jerusalem , and cast it away , and take up a lamentation on high places ; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath .
Lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scribes is in vain .
8 : 12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ?
8 : 18 When I would comfort myself against sorrow , my heart is faint in me .
Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images , and with strange vanities ?
8 : 20 The harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved .
9 : 9 Shall I not visit them for these things ?
9 : 19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion , How are we spoiled !
9 : 20 Yet hear the word of the LORD , O ye women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and every one her neighbour lamentation .
9 : 21 For death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
for to thee doth it appertain : forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their kingdoms , there is none like unto thee .
10 : 8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish : the stock is a doctrine of vanities .
10 : 13 When he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens , and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
10 : 18 For thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will distress them , that they may find it so .
11 : 19 But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter ; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me , saying , Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof , and let us cut him off from the land of the living , that his name may be no more remembered .
12 : 1 Righteous art thou , O LORD , when I plead with thee : yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments : Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper ?
12 : 6 For even thy brethren , and the house of thy father , even they have dealt treacherously with thee ; yea , they have called a multitude after thee : believe them not , though they speak fair words unto thee .
12 : 12 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness : for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh shall have peace .
13 : 3 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time , saying , 13 : 4 Take the girdle that thou hast got , which is upon thy loins , and arise , go to Euphrates , and hide it there in a hole of the rock .
13 : 7 Then I went to Euphrates , and digged , and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it : and , behold , the girdle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
13 : 8 Then the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 13 : 9 Thus saith the LORD , After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah , and the great pride of Jerusalem .
13 : 13 Then shalt thou say unto them , Thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will fill all the inhabitants of this land , even the kings that sit upon David ' s throne , and the priests , and the prophets , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , with drunkenness .
13 : 16 Give glory to the LORD your God , before he cause darkness , and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains , and , while ye look for light , he turn it into the shadow of death , and make it gross darkness .
13 : 20 Lift up your eyes , and behold them that come from the north : where is the flock that was given thee , thy beautiful flock ?
for thou hast taught them to be captains , and as chief over thee : shall not sorrows take thee , as a woman in travail ?
13 : 23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin , or the leopard his spots ?
14 : 1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth .
14 : 2 Judah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish ; they are black unto the ground ; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up .
14 : 11 Then said the LORD unto me , Pray not for this people for their good .
14 : 12 When they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation , I will not accept them : but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
behold , the prophets say unto them , Ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine ; but I will give you assured peace in this place .
14 : 15 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name , and I sent them not , yet they say , Sword and famine shall not be in this land ; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed .
and if I enter into the city , then behold them that are sick with famine !
we looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of healing , and behold trouble !
then thou shalt tell them , Thus saith the LORD ; Such as are for death , to death ; and such as are for the sword , to the sword ; and such as are for the famine , to the famine ; and such as are for the captivity , to the captivity .
15 : 3 And I will appoint over them four kinds , saith the LORD : the sword to slay , and the dogs to tear , and the fowls of the heaven , and the beasts of the earth , to devour and destroy .
15 : 9 She that hath borne seven languisheth : she hath given up the ghost ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day : she hath been ashamed and confounded : and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , saith the LORD .
15 : 11 The LORD said , Verily it shall be well with thy remnant ; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
17 : 6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh ; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
17 : 8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters , and that spreadeth out her roots by the river , and shall not see when heat cometh , but her leaf shall be green ; and shall not be careful in the year of drought , neither shall cease from yielding fruit .
17 : 14 Heal me , O LORD , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved : for thou art my praise .
let it come now .
17 : 19 Thus said the LORD unto me ; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people , whereby the kings of Judah come in , and by the which they go out , and in all the gates of Jerusalem ; 17 : 20 And say unto them , Hear ye the word of the LORD , ye kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates : 17 : 21 Thus saith the LORD ; Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ; 17 : 22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day , neither do ye any work , but hallow ye the sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
saith the LORD .
Behold , as the clay is in the potter ' s hand , so are ye in mine hand , O house of Israel .
18 : 15 Because my people hath forgotten me , they have burned incense to vanity , and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths , to walk in paths , in a way not cast up ; 18 : 16 To make their land desolate , and a perpetual hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished , and wag his head .
18 : 17 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will shew them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
18 : 23 Yet , LORD , thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me : forgive not their iniquity , neither blot out their sin from thy sight , but let them be overthrown before thee ; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger .
20 : 2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the LORD .
20 : 6 And thou , Pashur , and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity : and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be buried there , thou , and all thy friends , to whom thou hast prophesied lies .
Report , say they , and we will report it .
20 : 11 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
21 : 7 And afterward , saith the LORD , I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah , and his servants , and the people , and such as are left in this city from the pestilence , from the sword , and from the famine , into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those that seek their life : and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword ; he shall not spare them , neither have pity , nor have mercy .
22 : 6 For thus saith the LORD unto the king ' s house of Judah ; Thou art Gilead unto me , and the head of Lebanon : yet surely I will make thee a wilderness , and cities which are not inhabited .
22 : 9 Then they shall answer , Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God , and worshipped other gods , and served them .
or , Ah sister !
22 : 19 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
23 : 2 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people ; Ye have scattered my flock , and driven them away , and have not visited them : behold , I will visit upon you the evil of your doings , saith the LORD .
23 : 22 But if they had stood in my counsel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
24 : 7 And I will give them an heart to know me , that I am the LORD : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall return unto me with their whole heart .
25 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; 25 : 2 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying , 25 : 3 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the LORD hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened .
26 : 7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD .
26 : 8 Now it came to pass , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , Thou shalt surely die .
26 : 10 When the princes of Judah heard these things , then they came up from the king ' s house unto the house of the LORD , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD ' s house .
26 : 16 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God .
27 : 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD , saying , 27 : 2 Thus saith the LORD to me ; Make thee bonds and yokes , and put them upon thy neck , 27 : 3 And send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the Ammonites , and to the king of Tyrus , and to the king of Zidon , by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah ; 27 : 4 And command them to say unto their masters , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say unto your masters ; 27 : 5 I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my outstretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me .
27 : 6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
27 : 7 And all nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son ' s son , until the very time of his land come : and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him .
27 : 16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people , saying , Thus saith the LORD ; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you , saying , Behold , the vessels of the LORD ' s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon : for they prophesy a lie unto you .
And the prophet Jeremiah went his way .
28 : 16 Therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD .
29 : 7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives , and pray unto the LORD for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
29 : 14 And I will be found of you , saith the LORD : and I will turn away your captivity , and I will gather you from all the nations , and from all the places whither I have driven you , saith the LORD ; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive .
29 : 24 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite , saying , 29 : 25 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying , 29 : 26 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD , for every man that is mad , and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
30 : 12 For thus saith the LORD , Thy bruise is incurable , and thy wound is grievous .
31 : 6 For there shall be a day , that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry , Arise ye , and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God .
31 : 25 For I have satiated the weary soul , and I have replenished every sorrowful soul .
31 : 30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grape , his teeth shall be set on edge .
Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD .
32 : 13 And I charged Baruch before them , saying , 32 : 14 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Take these evidences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may continue many days .
32 : 30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the LORD .
32 : 36 And now therefore thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , concerning this city , whereof ye say , It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ; 32 : 37 Behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whither I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely : 32 : 38 And they shall be my people , and I will be their God : 32 : 39 And I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them : 32 : 40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
33 : 7 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
33 : 16 In those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , The LORD our righteousness .
33 : 19 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah , saying , 33 : 20 Thus saith the LORD ; If ye can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , and that there should not be day and night in their season ; 33 : 21 Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant , that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne ; and with the Levites the priests , my ministers .
34 : 11 But afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
34 : 12 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD , saying , 34 : 13 Thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondmen , saying , 34 : 14 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew , which hath been sold unto thee ; and when he hath served thee six years , thou shalt let him go free from thee : but your fathers hearkened not unto me , neither inclined their ear .
34 : 15 And ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name : 34 : 16 But ye turned and polluted my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure , to return , and brought them into subjection , to be unto you for servants and for handmaids .
36 : 14 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , unto Baruch , saying , Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people , and come .
36 : 25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear them .
36 : 27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying , 36 : 28 Take thee again another roll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned .
37 : 6 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying , 37 : 7 Thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to enquire of me ; Behold , Pharaoh ' s army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
37 : 8 And the Chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city , and take it , and burn it with fire .
37 : 14 Then said Jeremiah , It is false ; I fall not away to the Chaldeans .
37 : 20 Therefore hear now , I pray thee , O my lord the king : let my supplication , I pray thee , be accepted before thee ; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there .
37 : 21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers ' street , until all the bread in the city were spent .
38 : 3 Thus saith the LORD , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon ' s army , which shall take it .
38 : 20 But Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver thee .
38 : 24 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah , Let no man know of these words , and thou shalt not die .
38 : 25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee , and they come unto thee , and say unto thee , Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put thee to death ; also what the king said unto thee : 38 : 26 Then thou shalt say unto them , I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan ' s house , to die there .
38 : 28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken : and he was there when Jerusalem was taken .
39 : 3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in , and sat in the middle gate , even Nergalsharezer , Samgarnebo , Sarsechim , Rabsaris , Nergalsharezer , Rabmag , with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon .
39 : 10 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
39 : 11 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , saying , 39 : 12 Take him , and look well to him , and do him no harm ; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee .
40 : 3 Now the LORD hath brought it , and done according as he hath said : because ye have sinned against the LORD , and have not obeyed his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
40 : 4 And now , behold , I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand .
If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon , come ; and I will look well unto thee : but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon , forbear : behold , all the land is before thee : whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go , thither go .
So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward , and let him go .
40 : 6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land .
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not .
41 : 8 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael , Slay us not : for we have treasures in the field , of wheat , and of barley , and of oil , and of honey .
44 : 28 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah , and all the remnant of Judah , that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , shall know whose words shall stand , mine , or their ' s .
46 : 7 Who is this that cometh up as a flood , whose waters are moved as the rivers ?
46 : 8 Egypt riseth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he saith , I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
47 : 1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines , before that Pharaoh smote Gaza .
put up thyself into thy scabbard , rest , and be still .
48 : 7 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures , thou shalt also be taken : and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together .
48 : 19 O inhabitant of Aroer , stand by the way , and espy ; ask him that fleeth , and her that escapeth , and say , What is done ?
was he found among thieves ?
48 : 40 For thus saith the LORD ; Behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread his wings over Moab .
48 : 45 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon , and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and shall devour the corner of Moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
49 : 2 Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites ; and it shall be a desolate heap , and her daughters shall be burned with fire : then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs , saith the LORD .
if thieves by night , they will destroy till they have enough .
49 : 10 But I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
49 : 13 For I have sworn by myself , saith the LORD , that Bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
for who is like me ?
49 : 21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall , at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea .
49 : 27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus , and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad .
49 : 34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying , 49 : 35 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Behold , I will break the bow of Elam , the chief of their might .
50 : 2 Declare ye among the nations , and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and conceal not : say , Babylon is taken , Bel is confounded , Merodach is broken in pieces ; her idols are confounded , her images are broken in pieces .
50 : 7 All that found them have devoured them : and their adversaries said , We offend not , because they have sinned against the LORD , the habitation of justice , even the LORD , the hope of their fathers .
50 : 11 Because ye were glad , because ye rejoiced , O ye destroyers of mine heritage , because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass , and bellow as bulls ; 50 : 12 Your mother shall be sore confounded ; she that bare you shall be ashamed : behold , the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
50 : 14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about : all ye that bend the bow , shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she hath sinned against the LORD .
50 : 21 Go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : waste and utterly destroy after them , saith the LORD , and do according to all that I have commanded thee .
50 : 30 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the LORD .
50 : 38 A drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dried up : for it is the land of graven images , and they are mad upon their idols .
for who is like me ?
51 : 5 For Israel hath not been forsaken , nor Judah of his God , of the LORD of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
51 : 16 When he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens ; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth : he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
51 : 35 The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon , shall the inhabitant of Zion say ; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea , shall Jerusalem say .
51 : 41 How is Sheshach taken !
51 : 42 The sea is come up upon Babylon : she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof .
51 : 45 My people , go ye out of the midst of her , and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD .
51 : 49 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall , so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth .
51 : 51 We are confounded , because we have heard reproach : shame hath covered our faces : for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD ' s house .
51 : 63 And it shall be , when thou hast made an end of reading this book , that thou shalt bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of Euphrates : 51 : 64 And thou shalt say , Thus shall Babylon sink , and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her : and they shall be weary .
52 : 4 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it , and built forts against it round about .
52 : 5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah .
52 : 11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
52 : 20 The two pillars , one sea , and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD : the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
52 : 22 And a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about , all of brass .
52 : 26 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
1 : 14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand : they are wreathed , and come up upon my neck : he hath made my strength to fall , the LORD hath delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
2 : 1 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
2 : 10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground , and keep silence : they have cast up dust upon their heads ; they have girded themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
what thing shall I liken to thee , O daughter of Jerusalem ?
what shall I equal to thee , that I may comfort thee , O virgin daughter of Zion ?
3 : 3 Surely against me is he turned ; he turneth his hand against me all the day .
3 : 11 He hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces : he hath made me desolate .
3 : 18 And I said , My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD : 3 : 19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
3 : 26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD .
3 : 31 For the LORD will not cast off for ever : 3 : 32 But though he cause grief , yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies .
3 : 34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth .
3 : 40 Let us search and try our ways , and turn again to the LORD .
3 : 42 We have transgressed and have rebelled : thou hast not pardoned .
3 : 46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us .
3 : 54 Waters flowed over mine head ; then I said , I am cut off .
3 : 57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee : thou saidst , Fear not .
3 : 60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me .
4 : 6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom , that was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
4 : 18 They hunt our steps , that we cannot go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end is come .
5 : 18 Because of the mountain of Zion , which is desolate , the foxes walk upon it .
1 : 5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures .
1 : 10 As for the likeness of their faces , they four had the face of a man , and the face of a lion , on the right side : and they four had the face of an ox on the left side ; they four also had the face of an eagle .
1 : 14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
1 : 28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain , so was the appearance of the brightness round about .
This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD .
2 : 6 And thou , son of man , be not afraid of them , neither be afraid of their words , though briers and thorns be with thee , and thou dost dwell among scorpions : be not afraid of their words , nor be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
3 : 2 So I opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat that roll .
3 : 9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead : fear them not , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
3 : 16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 3 : 17 Son of man , I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
3 : 25 But thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them : 3 : 26 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
4 : 11 Thou shalt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of an hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
4 : 12 And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes , and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man , in their sight .
behold , my soul hath not been polluted : for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself , or is torn in pieces ; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth .
5 : 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my judgments , neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you ; 5 : 8 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
I the LORD have spoken it .
6 : 10 And they shall know that I am the LORD , and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
7 : 1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 7 : 2 Also , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel ; An end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
7 : 4 And mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will recompense thy ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
7 : 12 The time is come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn : for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
7 : 14 They have blown the trumpet , even to make all ready ; but none goeth to the battle : for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
7 : 20 As for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty : but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein : therefore have I set it far from them .
And he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer ' s inkhorn by his side ; 9 : 4 And the LORD said unto him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof .
10 : 9 And when I looked , behold the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone .
10 : 13 As for the wheels , it was cried unto them in my hearing , O wheel .
11 : 9 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
11 : 10 Ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
11 : 13 And it came to pass , when I prophesied , that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died .
11 : 17 Therefore say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will even gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
11 : 22 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings , and the wheels beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
11 : 23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
11 : 24 Afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity .
12 : 3 Therefore , thou son of man , prepare thee stuff for removing , and remove by day in their sight ; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight : it may be they will consider , though they be a rebellious house .
12 : 14 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
13 : 6 They have seen vanity and lying divination , saying , The LORD saith : and the LORD hath not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
13 : 19 And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread , to slay the souls that should not die , and to save the souls alive that should not live , by your lying to my people that hear your lies ?
14 : 9 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , I the LORD have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
15 : 4 Behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned .
15 : 6 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
16 : 4 And as for thy nativity , in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee ; thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
16 : 7 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field , and thou hast increased and waxen great , and thou art come to excellent ornaments : thy breasts are fashioned , and thine hair is grown , whereas thou wast naked and bare .
16 : 11 I decked thee also with ornaments , and I put bracelets upon thy hands , and a chain on thy neck .
16 : 14 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty : for it was perfect through my comeliness , which I had put upon thee , saith the Lord GOD .
16 : 43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , but hast fretted me in all these things ; behold , therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head , saith the Lord GOD : and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations .
16 : 47 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their abominations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
16 : 60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
17 : 5 He took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a willow tree .
17 : 9 Say thou , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Shall it prosper ?
shall it not utterly wither , when the east wind toucheth it ?
17 : 22 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar , and will set it ; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one , and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent : 17 : 23 In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it : and it shall bring forth boughs , and bear fruit , and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing ; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell .
17 : 24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree , have exalted the low tree , have dried up the green tree , and have made the dry tree to flourish : I the LORD have spoken and have done it .
18 : 1 The word of the LORD came unto me again , saying , 18 : 2 What mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children ' s teeth are set on edge ?
When the son hath done that which is lawful and right , and hath kept all my statutes , and hath done them , he shall surely live .
18 : 21 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
are not your ways unequal ?
18 : 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions , whereby ye have transgressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
19 : 10 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood , planted by the waters : she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
20 : 8 But they rebelled against me , and would not hearken unto me : they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes , neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt : then I said , I will pour out my fury upon them , to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt .
20 : 13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness : they walked not in my statutes , and they despised my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them ; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted : then I said , I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness , to consume them .
20 : 21 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me : they walked not in my statutes , neither kept my judgments to do them , which if a man do , he shall even live in them ; they polluted my sabbaths : then I said , I would pour out my fury upon them , to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness .
As I live , saith the Lord GOD , I will not be enquired of by you .
21 : 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 21 : 2 Son of man , set thy face toward Jerusalem , and drop thy word toward the holy places , and prophesy against the land of Israel , 21 : 3 And say to the land of Israel , Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
that thou shalt answer , For the tidings ; because it cometh : and every heart shall melt , and all hands shall be feeble , and every spirit shall faint , and all knees shall be weak as water : behold , it cometh , and shall be brought to pass , saith the Lord GOD .
21 : 8 Again the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 21 : 9 Son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus saith the LORD ; Say , A sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished : 21 : 10 It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ?
it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
and let the sword be doubled the third time , the sword of the slain : it is the sword of the great men that are slain , which entereth into their privy chambers .
21 : 15 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : ah !
21 : 17 I will also smite mine hands together , and I will cause my fury to rest : I the LORD have said it .
21 : 21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way , at the head of the two ways , to use divination : he made his arrows bright , he consulted with images , he looked in the liver .
21 : 28 And thou , son of man , prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites , and concerning their reproach ; even say thou , The sword , the sword is drawn : for the slaughter it is furbished , to consume because of the glittering : 21 : 29 Whiles they see vanity unto thee , whiles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their iniquity shall have an end .
22 : 14 Can thine heart endure , or can thine hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with thee ?
I the LORD have spoken it , and will do it .
22 : 16 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen , and thou shalt know that I am the LORD .
22 : 17 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 22 : 18 Son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
22 : 25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof , like a roaring lion ravening the prey ; they have devoured souls ; they have taken the treasure and precious things ; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof .
23 : 8 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
23 : 20 For she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
23 : 22 Therefore , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ; 23 : 23 The Babylonians , and all the Chaldeans , Pekod , and Shoa , and Koa , and all the Assyrians with them : all of them desirable young men , captains and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses .
23 : 35 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast forgotten me , and cast me behind thy back , therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms .
yea , declare unto them their abominations ; 23 : 37 That they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands , and with their idols have they committed adultery , and have also caused their sons , whom they bare unto me , to pass for them through the fire , to devour them .
23 : 44 Yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah , the lewd women .
23 : 47 And the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
24 : 6 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose scum is therein , and whose scum is not gone out of it !
bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall upon it .
24 : 18 So I spake unto the people in the morning : and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
24 : 27 In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
26 : 1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 26 : 2 Son of man , because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem , Aha , she is broken that was the gates of the people : she is turned unto me : I shall be replenished , now she is laid waste : 26 : 3 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against thee , O Tyrus , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea causeth his waves to come up .
26 : 9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls , and with his axes he shall break down thy towers .
26 : 13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease ; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard .
27 : 1 The word of the LORD came again unto me , saying , 27 : 2 Now , thou son of man , take up a lamentation for Tyrus ; 27 : 3 And say unto Tyrus , O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea , which art a merchant of the people for many isles , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; O Tyrus , thou hast said , I am of perfect beauty .
27 : 4 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas , thy builders have perfected thy beauty .
27 : 7 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee .
27 : 26 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas .
27 : 32 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and lament over thee , saying , What city is like Tyrus , like the destroyed in the midst of the sea ?
27 : 35 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee , and their kings shall be sore afraid , they shall be troubled in their countenance .
28 : 14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
28 : 16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned : therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee , O covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
28 : 19 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee : thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt thou be any more .
28 : 20 Again the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 28 : 21 Son of man , set thy face against Zidon , and prophesy against it , 28 : 22 And say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against thee , O Zidon ; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee : and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I shall have executed judgments in her , and shall be sanctified in her .
29 : 6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel .
29 : 9 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste ; and they shall know that I am the LORD : because he hath said , The river is mine , and I have made it .
29 : 16 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel , which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance , when they shall look after them : but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
29 : 17 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 29 : 18 Son of man , Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus : every head was made bald , and every shoulder was peeled : yet had he no wages , nor his army , for Tyrus , for the service that he had served against it : 29 : 19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall take her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
30 : 1 The word of the LORD came again unto me , saying , 30 : 2 Son of man , prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Howl ye , Woe worth the day !
30 : 3 For the day is near , even the day of the LORD is near , a cloudy day ; it shall be the time of the heathen .
30 : 10 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon .
31 : 9 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches : so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied him .
31 : 10 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height , and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ; 31 : 11 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
31 : 18 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden ?
yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth : thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword .
32 : 8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , saith the Lord GOD .
32 : 10 Yea , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee , when I shall brandish my sword before them ; and they shall tremble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall .
32 : 15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the LORD .
33 : 17 Yet the children of thy people say , The way of the Lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
33 : 23 Then the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 33 : 24 Son of man , they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak , saying , Abraham was one , and he inherited the land : but we are many ; the land is given us for inheritance .
33 : 26 Ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbour ' s wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
33 : 27 Say thou thus unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; As I live , surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword , and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured , and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence .
34 : 3 Ye eat the fat , and ye clothe you with the wool , ye kill them that are fed : but ye feed not the flock .
34 : 4 The diseased have ye not strengthened , neither have ye healed that which was sick , neither have ye bound up that which was broken , neither have ye brought again that which was driven away , neither have ye sought that which was lost ; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them .
34 : 7 Therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of the LORD ; 34 : 8 As I live , saith the Lord GOD , surely because my flock became a prey , and my flock became meat to every beast of the field , because there was no shepherd , neither did my shepherds search for my flock , but the shepherds fed themselves , and fed not my flock ; 34 : 9 Therefore , O ye shepherds , hear the word of the LORD ; 34 : 10 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against the shepherds ; and I will require my flock at their hand , and cause them to cease from feeding the flock ; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more ; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth , that they may not be meat for them .
34 : 12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered ; so will I seek out my sheep , and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
34 : 15 I will feed my flock , and I will cause them to lie down , saith the Lord GOD .
34 : 27 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit , and the earth shall yield her increase , and they shall be safe in their land , and shall know that I am the LORD , when I have broken the bands of their yoke , and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them .
35 : 12 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD , and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
36 : 6 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel , and say unto the mountains , and to the hills , to the rivers , and to the valleys , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury , because ye have borne the shame of the heathen : 36 : 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; I have lifted up mine hand , Surely the heathen that are about you , they shall bear their shame .
36 : 8 But ye , O mountains of Israel , ye shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people of Israel ; for they are at hand to come .
36 : 13 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because they say unto you , Thou land devourest up men , and hast bereaved thy nations : 36 : 14 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more , neither bereave thy nations any more , saith the Lord GOD .
36 : 33 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
36 : 38 As the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
37 : 1 The hand of the LORD was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD , and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones , 37 : 2 And caused me to pass by them round about : and , behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and , lo , they were very dry .
37 : 12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel .
37 : 26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore .
38 : 10 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; It shall also come to pass , that at the same time shall things come into thy mind , and thou shalt think an evil thought : 38 : 11 And thou shalt say , I will go up to the land of unwalled villages ; I will go to them that are at rest , that dwell safely , all of them dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates , 38 : 12 To take a spoil , and to take a prey ; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited , and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations , which have gotten cattle and goods , that dwell in the midst of the land .
38 : 13 Sheba , and Dedan , and the merchants of Tarshish , with all the young lions thereof , shall say unto thee , Art thou come to take a spoil ?
to carry away silver and gold , to take away cattle and goods , to take a great spoil ?
39 : 4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel , thou , and all thy bands , and the people that is with thee : I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort , and to the beasts of the field to be devoured .
39 : 5 Thou shalt fall upon the open field : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord GOD .
39 : 9 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth , and shall set on fire and burn the weapons , both the shields and the bucklers , the bows and the arrows , and the handstaves , and the spears , and they shall burn them with fire seven years : 39 : 10 So that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall burn the weapons with fire : and they shall spoil those that spoiled them , and rob those that robbed them , saith the Lord GOD .
39 : 13 Yea , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified , saith the Lord GOD .
39 : 16 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah .
39 : 17 And , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Speak unto every feathered fowl , and to every beast of the field , Assemble yourselves , and come ; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you , even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel , that ye may eat flesh , and drink blood .
40 : 7 And every little chamber was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed .
40 : 15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits .
40 : 17 Then brought he me into the outward court , and , lo , there were chambers , and a pavement made for the court round about : thirty chambers were upon the pavement .
40 : 33 And the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , were according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
40 : 44 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
40 : 48 And he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
41 : 2 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits ; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side , and five cubits on the other side : and he measured the length thereof , forty cubits : and the breadth , twenty cubits .
41 : 22 The altar of wood was three cubits high , and the length thereof two cubits ; and the corners thereof , and the length thereof , and the walls thereof , were of wood : and he said unto me , This is the table that is before the LORD .
41 : 23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors .
42 : 6 For they were in three stories , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground .
42 : 11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north , as long as they , and as broad as they : and all their goings out were both according to their fashions , and according to their doors .
42 : 12 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one entereth into them .
42 : 17 He measured the north side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
42 : 19 He turned about to the west side , and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
43 : 4 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
43 : 13 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits : The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth ; even the bottom shall be a cubit , and the breadth a cubit , and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span : and this shall be the higher place of the altar .
43 : 15 So the altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns .
43 : 24 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD .
44 : 13 And they shall not come near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
44 : 14 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein .
45 : 11 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer , and the ephah the tenth part of an homer : the measure thereof shall be after the homer .
45 : 12 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs : twenty shekels , five and twenty shekels , fifteen shekels , shall be your maneh .
45 : 22 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
46 : 2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without , and shall stand by the post of the gate , and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings , and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate : then he shall go forth ; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening .
46 : 10 And the prince in the midst of them , when they go in , shall go in ; and when they go forth , shall go forth .
46 : 14 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning , the sixth part of an ephah , and the third part of an hin of oil , to temper with the fine flour ; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD .
Again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins .
47 : 11 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed ; they shall be given to salt .
47 : 13 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; This shall be the border , whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph shall have two portions .
47 : 14 And ye shall inherit it , one as well as another : concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers : and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance .
48 : 10 And for them , even for the priests , shall be this holy oblation ; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length , and toward the west ten thousand in breadth , and toward the east ten thousand in breadth , and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length : and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof .
48 : 16 And these shall be the measures thereof ; the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
48 : 23 As for the rest of the tribes , from the east side unto the west side , Benjamin shall have a portion .
The Book of Daniel
1 : 20 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding , that the king enquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm .
1 : 21 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus .
2 : 1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams , wherewith his spirit was troubled , and his sleep brake from him .
2 : 6 But if ye shew the dream , and the interpretation thereof , ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour : therefore shew me the dream , and the interpretation thereof .
2 : 8 The king answered and said , I know of certainty that ye would gain the time , because ye see the thing is gone from me .
2 : 20 Daniel answered and said , Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever : for wisdom and might are his : 2 : 21 And he changeth the times and the seasons : he removeth kings , and setteth up kings : he giveth wisdom unto the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding : 2 : 22 He revealeth the deep and secret things : he knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him .
2 : 24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch , whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon : he went and said thus unto him ; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon : bring me in before the king , and I will shew unto the king the interpretation .
2 : 30 But as for me , this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living , but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king , and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart .
2 : 31 Thou , O king , sawest , and behold a great image .
This great image , whose brightness was excellent , stood before thee ; and the form thereof was terrible .
2 : 38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell , the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand , and hath made thee ruler over them all .
2 : 39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee , and another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
2 : 42 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
3 : 7 Therefore at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and all kinds of musick , all the people , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
3 : 10 Thou , O king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , shall fall down and worship the golden image : 3 : 11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth , that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
3 : 13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
3 : 14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them , Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
4 : 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king , unto all people , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth ; Peace be multiplied unto you .
4 : 17 This matter is by the decree of the watchers , and the demand by the word of the holy ones : to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will , and setteth up over it the basest of men .
4 : 18 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen .
The king spake , and said , Belteshazzar , let not the dream , or the interpretation thereof , trouble thee .
4 : 28 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar .
4 : 29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon .
5 : 2 Belshazzar , whiles he tasted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , might drink therein .
5 : 8 Then came in all the king ' s wise men : but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof .
6 : 5 Then said these men , We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his God .
6 : 9 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree .
6 : 15 Then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , Know , O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is , That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed .
Now the king spake and said unto Daniel , Thy God whom thou servest continually , he will deliver thee .
6 : 24 And the king commanded , and they brought those men which had accused Daniel , and they cast them into the den of lions , them , their children , and their wives ; and the lions had the mastery of them , and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den .
7 : 4 The first was like a lion , and had eagle ' s wings : I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made stand upon the feet as a man , and a man ' s heart was given to it .
7 : 13 I saw in the night visions , and , behold , one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the Ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
7 : 18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom , and possess the kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever .
7 : 21 I beheld , and the same horn made war with the saints , and prevailed against them ; 7 : 22 Until the Ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most High ; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
8 : 8 Therefore the he goat waxed very great : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven .
8 : 11 Yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of the sanctuary was cast down .
8 : 13 Then I heard one saint speaking , and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake , How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice , and the transgression of desolation , to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot ?
8 : 17 So he came near where I stood : and when he came , I was afraid , and fell upon my face : but he said unto me , Understand , O son of man : for at the time of the end shall be the vision .
8 : 24 And his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power : and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper , and practise , and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people .
9 : 3 And I set my face unto the Lord God , to seek by prayer and supplications , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes : 9 : 4 And I prayed unto the LORD my God , and made my confession , and said , O Lord , the great and dreadful God , keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him , and to them that keep his commandments ; 9 : 5 We have sinned , and have committed iniquity , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments : 9 : 6 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets , which spake in thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
10 : 2 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks .
10 : 15 And when he had spoken such words unto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb .
11 : 2 And now will I shew thee the truth .
Behold , there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia ; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all : and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia .
11 : 11 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multitude ; but the multitude shall be given into his hand .
11 : 13 For the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former , and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches .
11 : 15 So the king of the north shall come , and cast up a mount , and take the most fenced cities : and the arms of the south shall not withstand , neither his chosen people , neither shall there be any strength to withstand .
11 : 17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom , and upright ones with him ; thus shall he do : and he shall give him the daughter of women , corrupting her : but she shall not stand on his side , neither be for him .
11 : 19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land : but he shall stumble and fall , and not be found .
11 : 31 And arms shall stand on his part , and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate .
11 : 33 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many : yet they shall fall by the sword , and by flame , by captivity , and by spoil , many days .
12 : 4 But thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
12 : 9 And he said , Go thy way , Daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
And God said unto him , Call her name Loruhamah : for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel ; but I will utterly take them away .
1 : 8 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah , she conceived , and bare a son .
2 : 5 For their mother hath played the harlot : she that conceived them hath done shamefully : for she said , I will go after my lovers , that give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , mine oil and my drink .
2 : 13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the LORD .
2 : 17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth , and they shall no more be remembered by their name .
2 : 21 And it shall come to pass in that day , I will hear , saith the LORD , I will hear the heavens , and they shall hear the earth ; 2 : 22 And the earth shall hear the corn , and the wine , and the oil ; and they shall hear Jezreel .
2 : 23 And I will sow her unto me in the earth ; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to them which were not my people , Thou art my people ; and they shall say , Thou art my God .
3 : 1 Then said the LORD unto me , Go yet , love a woman beloved of her friend , yet an adulteress , according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel , who look to other gods , and love flagons of wine .
4 : 2 By swearing , and lying , and killing , and stealing , and committing adultery , they break out , and blood toucheth blood .
4 : 4 Yet let no man strive , nor reprove another : for thy people are as they that strive with the priest .
4 : 6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge : because thou hast rejected knowledge , I will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to me : seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God , I will also forget thy children .
4 : 7 As they were increased , so they sinned against me : therefore will I change their glory into shame .
6 : 4 O Ephraim , what shall I do unto thee ?
O Judah , what shall I do unto thee ?
7 : 11 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart : they call to Egypt , they go to Assyria .
for they have fled from me : destruction unto them !
8 : 1 Set the trumpet to thy mouth .
8 : 2 Israel shall cry unto me , My God , we know thee .
8 : 9 For they are gone up to Assyria , a wild ass alone by himself : Ephraim hath hired lovers .
9 : 12 Though they bring up their children , yet will I bereave them , that there shall not be a man left : yea , woe also to them when I depart from them !
9 : 14 Give them , O LORD : what wilt thou give ?
10 : 5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven : for the people thereof shall mourn over it , and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it , for the glory thereof , because it is departed from it .
10 : 14 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children .
11 : 6 And the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches , and devour them , because of their own counsels .
11 : 8 How shall I give thee up , Ephraim ?
12 : 1 Ephraim feedeth on wind , and followeth after the east wind : he daily increaseth lies and desolation ; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians , and oil is carried into Egypt .
13 : 3 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
I have heard him , and observed him : I am like a green fir tree .
From me is thy fruit found .
1 : 20 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
2 : 7 They shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks : 2 : 8 Neither shall one thrust another ; they shall walk every one in his path : and when they fall upon the sword , they shall not be wounded .
2 : 22 Be not afraid , ye beasts of the field : for the pastures of the wilderness do spring , for the tree beareth her fruit , the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength .
3 : 3 And they have cast lots for my people ; and have given a boy for an harlot , and sold a girl for wine , that they might drink .
3 : 7 Behold , I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them , and will return your recompence upon your own head : 3 : 8 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah , and they shall sell them to the Sabeans , to a people far off : for the LORD hath spoken it .
3 : 9 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles ; Prepare war , wake up the mighty men , let all the men of war draw near ; let them come up : 3 : 10 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears : let the weak say , I am strong .
Is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ?
shall there be evil in a city , and the LORD hath not done it ?
4 : 2 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness , that , lo , the days shall come upon you , that he will take you away with hooks , and your posterity with fishhooks .
4 : 9 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew : when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased , the palmerworm devoured them : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the LORD .
5 : 6 Seek the LORD , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and devour it , and there be none to quench it in Bethel .
5 : 20 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness , and not light ?
even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
or their border greater than your border ?
6 : 11 For , behold , the LORD commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
7 : 3 The LORD repented for this : It shall not be , saith the LORD .
7 : 6 The LORD repented for this : This also shall not be , saith the Lord GOD .
8 : 14 They that swear by the sin of Samaria , and say , Thy god , O Dan , liveth ; and , The manner of Beersheba liveth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
9 : 10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword , which say , The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us .
Obadiah
1 : 5 If thieves came to thee , if robbers by night , ( how art thou cut off !)
1 : 19 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau ; and they of the plain the Philistines : and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim , and the fields of Samaria : and Benjamin shall possess Gilead .
1 : 5 Then the mariners were afraid , and cried every man unto his god , and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea , to lighten it of them .
1 : 6 So the shipmaster came to him , and said unto him , What meanest thou , O sleeper ?
for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous .
1 : 13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not : for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous against them .
2 : 9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving ; I will pay that that I have vowed .
3 : 6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered him with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly ?
2 : 13 The breaker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the LORD on the head of them .
3 : 6 Therefore night shall be unto you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark unto you , that ye shall not divine ; and the sun shall go down over the prophets , and the day shall be dark over them .
4 : 3 And he shall judge among many people , and rebuke strong nations afar off ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
is thy counsellor perished ?
5 : 3 Therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth : then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel .
6 : 9 The LORD ' s voice crieth unto the city , and the man of wisdom shall see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it .
6 : 14 Thou shalt eat , but not be satisfied ; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee ; and thou shalt take hold , but shalt not deliver ; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword .
7 : 3 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly , the prince asketh , and the judge asketh for a reward ; and the great man , he uttereth his mischievous desire : so they wrap it up .
7 : 8 Rejoice not against me , O mine enemy : when I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darkness , the LORD shall be a light unto me .
7 : 9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD , because I have sinned against him , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold his righteousness .
7 : 11 In the day that thy walls are to be built , in that day shall the decree be far removed .
7 : 15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things .
Nahum
3 : 1 Woe to the bloody city !
it is all full of lies and robbery ; the prey departeth not ; 3 : 2 The noise of a whip , and the noise of the rattling of the wheels , and of the pransing horses , and of the jumping chariots .
3 : 10 Yet was she carried away , she went into captivity : her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honourable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
1 : 1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see .
1 : 2 O LORD , how long shall I cry , and thou wilt not hear !
1 : 3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity , and cause me to behold grievance ?
1 : 9 They shall come all for violence : their faces shall sup up as the east wind , and they shall gather the captivity as the sand .
O LORD , thou hast ordained them for judgment ; and , O mighty God , thou hast established them for correction .
2 : 2 And the LORD answered me , and said , Write the vision , and make it plain upon tables , that he may run that readeth it .
2 : 8 Because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men ' s blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
2 : 11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
2 : 18 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it ; the molten image , and a teacher of lies , that the maker of his work trusteth therein , to make dumb idols ?
2 : 19 Woe unto him that saith to the wood , Awake ; to the dumb stone , Arise , it shall teach !
3 : 8 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers ?
Selah .
3 : 10 The mountains saw thee , and they trembled : the overflowing of the water passed by : the deep uttered his voice , and lifted up his hands on high .
1 : 14 The great day of the LORD is near , it is near , and hasteth greatly , even the voice of the day of the LORD : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
1 : 15 That day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of wasteness and desolation , a day of darkness and gloominess , a day of clouds and thick darkness , 1 : 16 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities , and against the high towers .
3 : 1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted , to the oppressing city !
3 : 8 Therefore wait ye upon me , saith the LORD , until the day that I rise up to the prey : for my determination is to gather the nations , that I may assemble the kingdoms , to pour upon them mine indignation , even all my fierce anger : for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy .
3 : 18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly , who are of thee , to whom the reproach of it was a burden .
2 : 10 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet , saying , 2 : 11 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Ask now the priests concerning the law , saying , 2 : 12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment , and with his skirt do touch bread , or pottage , or wine , or oil , or any meat , shall it be holy ?
2 : 15 And now , I pray you , consider from this day and upward , from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD : 2 : 16 Since those days were , when one came to an heap of twenty measures , there were but ten : when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press , there were but twenty .
1 : 6 But my words and my statutes , which I commanded my servants the prophets , did they not take hold of your fathers ?
1 : 16 Therefore thus saith the LORD ; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies : my house shall be built in it , saith the LORD of hosts , and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem .
1 : 17 Cry yet , saying , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad ; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion , and shall yet choose Jerusalem .
And he answered me , These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem .
2 : 7 Deliver thyself , O Zion , that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon .
2 : 8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts ; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye .
2 : 10 Sing and rejoice , O daughter of Zion : for , lo , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of thee , saith the LORD .
2 : 13 Be silent , O all flesh , before the LORD : for he is raised up out of his holy habitation .
3 : 2 And the LORD said unto Satan , The LORD rebuke thee , O Satan ; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee : is not this a brand plucked out of the fire ?
4 : 1 And the angel that talked with me came again , and waked me , as a man that is wakened out of his sleep .
And I said , I have looked , and behold a candlestick all of gold , with a bowl upon the top of it , and his seven lamps thereon , and seven pipes to the seven lamps , which are upon the top thereof : 4 : 3 And two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof .
4 : 13 And he answered me and said , Knowest thou not what these be ?
5 : 5 Then the angel that talked with me went forth , and said unto me , Lift up now thine eyes , and see what is this that goeth forth .
6 : 6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country ; and the white go forth after them ; and the grisled go forth toward the south country .
7 : 4 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me , saying , 7 : 5 Speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy years , did ye at all fast unto me , even to me ?
7 : 7 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and the cities thereof round about her , when men inhabited the south and the plain ?
8 : 1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me , saying , 8 : 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy , and I was jealous for her with great fury .
8 : 14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts ; As I thought to punish you , when your fathers provoked me to wrath , saith the LORD of hosts , and I repented not : 8 : 15 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah : fear ye not .
8 : 16 These are the things that ye shall do ; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates : 8 : 17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour ; and love no false oath : for all these are things that I hate , saith the LORD .
9 : 16 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a crown , lifted up as an ensign upon his land .
10 : 3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds , and I punished the goats : for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah , and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle .
10 : 5 And they shall be as mighty men , which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the LORD is with them , and the riders on horses shall be confounded .
11 : 3 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds ; for their glory is spoiled : a voice of the roaring of young lions ; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled .
11 : 11 And it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD .
So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver .
And I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD .
13 : 1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness .
13 : 2 And it shall come to pass in that day , saith the LORD of hosts , that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land , and they shall no more be remembered : and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land .
13 : 4 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision , when he hath prophesied ; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive : 13 : 5 But he shall say , I am no prophet , I am an husbandman ; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth .
14 : 5 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains ; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal : yea , ye shall flee , like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah : and the LORD my God shall come , and all the saints with thee .
14 : 19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles .
14 : 20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses , HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD ; and the pots in the LORD ' s house shall be like the bowls before the altar .
Malachi
1 : 2 I have loved you , saith the LORD .
saith the LORD of hosts unto you , O priests , that despise my name .
In that ye say , The table of the LORD is contemptible .
2 : 1 And now , O ye priests , this commandment is for you .
2 : 2 If ye will not hear , and if ye will not lay it to heart , to give glory unto my name , saith the LORD of hosts , I will even send a curse upon you , and I will curse your blessings : yea , I have cursed them already , because ye do not lay it to heart .
why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother , by profaning the covenant of our fathers ?
2 : 14 Yet ye say , Wherefore ?
Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth , against whom thou hast dealt treacherously : yet is she thy companion , and the wife of thy covenant .
2 : 17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words .
3 : 1 Behold , I will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the LORD , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to his temple , even the messenger of the covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the LORD of hosts .
3 : 8 Will a man rob God ?
But ye say , Wherein have we robbed thee ?
3 : 17 And they shall be mine , saith the LORD of hosts , in that day when I make up my jewels ; and I will spare them , as a man spareth his own son that serveth him .
4 : 1 For , behold , the day cometh , that shall burn as an oven ; and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly , shall be stubble : and the day that cometh shall burn them up , saith the LORD of hosts , that it shall leave them neither root nor branch .
1 : 2 Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren ; 1 : 3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom ; and Esrom begat Aram ; 1 : 4 And Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson ; and Naasson begat Salmon ; 1 : 5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ; 1 : 6 And Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias ; 1 : 7 And Solomon begat Roboam ; and Roboam begat Abia ; and Abia begat Asa ; 1 : 8 And Asa begat Josaphat ; and Josaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Ozias ; 1 : 9 And Ozias begat Joatham ; and Joatham begat Achaz ; and Achaz begat Ezekias ; 1 : 10 And Ezekias begat Manasses ; and Manasses begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josias ; 1 : 11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon : 1 : 12 And after they were brought to Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel ; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel ; 1 : 13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ; 1 : 14 And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ; 1 : 15 And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ; 1 : 16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
1 : 22 Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , 1 : 23 Behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us .
1 : 24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife : 1 : 25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name JESUS .
2 : 7 Then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
2 : 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
2 : 10 When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
3 : 5 Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about Jordan , 3 : 6 And were baptized of him in Jordan , confessing their sins .
4 : 17 From that time Jesus began to preach , and to say , Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
4 : 18 And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
5 : 23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ; 5 : 24 Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
5 : 30 And if thy right hand offend thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
6 : 8 Be not ye therefore like unto them : for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
6 : 9 After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name .
6 : 23 But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness .
If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness !
Ye cannot serve God and mammon .
6 : 26 Behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them .
Are ye not much better than they ?
Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin : 6 : 29 And yet I say unto you , That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
or , What shall we drink ?
8 : 1 When he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
8 : 4 And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
8 : 25 And his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , Lord , save us : we perish .
Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
8 : 27 But the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him !
8 : 29 And , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God ?
8 : 31 So the devils besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine .
9 : 7 And he arose , and departed to his house .
And he arose , and followed him .
9 : 15 And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ?
9 : 27 And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou son of David , have mercy on us .
10 : 22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
10 : 24 The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
10 : 28 And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
10 : 40 He that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
A prophet ?
11 : 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a devil .
11 : 19 The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners .
11 : 27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
12 : 7 But if ye had known what this meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ?
Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days .
12 : 27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ?
therefore they shall be your judges .
12 : 34 O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ?
12 : 38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered , saying , Master , we would see a sign from thee .
12 : 39 But he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas : 12 : 40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale ' s belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
12 : 41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
12 : 42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
12 : 48 But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ?
13 : 9 Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
13 : 13 Therefore speak I to them in parables : because they seeing see not ; and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
13 : 20 But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ; 13 : 21 Yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
13 : 24 Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field : 13 : 25 But while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
from whence then hath it tares ?
13 : 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father .
13 : 45 Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls : 13 : 46 Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
13 : 47 Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind : 13 : 48 Which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
13 : 51 Jesus saith unto them , Have ye understood all these things ?
They say unto him , Yea , Lord .
13 : 54 And when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
13 : 56 And his sisters , are they not all with us ?
14 : 1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus , 14 : 2 And said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
14 : 18 He said , Bring them hither to me .
14 : 27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them , saying , Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not afraid .
14 : 29 And he said , Come .
for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
15 : 10 And he called the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand : 15 : 11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
And his disciples came and besought him , saying , Send her away ; for she crieth after us .
15 : 24 But he answered and said , I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
15 : 32 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
15 : 35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
15 : 36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
16 : 2 He answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
17 : 4 Then answered Peter , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
17 : 17 Then Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ?
how long shall I suffer you ?
of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute ?
18 : 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
18 : 11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost .
if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth into the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
18 : 21 Then came Peter to him , and said , Lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ?
18 : 22 Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times : but , Until seventy times seven .
18 : 23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
18 : 34 And his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
19 : 7 They say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ?
19 : 8 He saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
19 : 16 And , behold , one came and said unto him , Good Master , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ?
19 : 21 Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
20 : 5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
20 : 7 They say unto him , Because no man hath hired us .
20 : 29 And as they departed from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
20 : 32 And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
20 : 34 So Jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
21 : 3 And if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
21 : 12 And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves , 21 : 13 And said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
And he answered and said , I go , sir : and went not .
21 : 36 Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
21 : 38 But when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
21 : 41 They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
22 : 1 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables , and said , 22 : 2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king , which made a marriage for his son , 22 : 3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
22 : 8 Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
And he was speechless .
22 : 14 For many are called , but few are chosen .
22 : 21 They say unto him , Caesar ' s .
22 : 22 When they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
22 : 23 The same day came to him the Sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him , 22 : 24 Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
for they all had her .
22 : 29 Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
22 : 43 He saith unto them , How then doth David in spirit call him Lord , saying , 22 : 44 The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law , judgment , mercy , and faith : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
23 : 24 Ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
23 : 29 Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites !
because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous , 23 : 30 And say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
24 : 19 And woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
24 : 24 For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
24 : 25 Behold , I have told you before .
24 : 38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , 24 : 39 And knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
24 : 41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
25 : 6 And at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
25 : 18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord ' s money .
25 : 28 Take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
25 : 30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
25 : 39 Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
26 : 13 Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
26 : 23 And he answered and said , He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
He said unto him , Thou hast said .
26 : 33 Peter answered and said unto him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended .
26 : 44 And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
26 : 49 And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said , Hail , master ; and kissed him .
Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
26 : 70 But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest .
27 : 14 And he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
27 : 21 The governor answered and said unto them , Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ?
27 : 22 Pilate saith unto them , What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ ?
27 : 24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
27 : 48 And straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
27 : 50 Jesus , when he had cried again with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
27 : 54 Now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God .
28 : 1 In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre .
And they came and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
28 : 10 Then said Jesus unto them , Be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee , and there shall they see me .
28 : 16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee , into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
28 : 18 And Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
28 : 19 Go ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost : 28 : 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world .
Amen .
1 : 3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
1 : 8 I indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost .
1 : 17 And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
1 : 20 And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
1 : 28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
1 : 29 And forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
1 : 33 And all the city was gathered together at the door .
1 : 34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
1 : 38 And he said unto them , Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also : for therefore came I forth .
2 : 1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days ; and it was noised that he was in the house .
2 : 6 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts , 2 : 7 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ?
2 : 15 And it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
3 : 1 And he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
3 : 4 And he saith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ?
3 : 9 And he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
3 : 27 No man can enter into a strong man ' s house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
4 : 1 And he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
4 : 2 And he taught them many things by parables , and said unto them in his doctrine , 4 : 3 Hearken ; Behold , there went out a sower to sow : 4 : 4 And it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
4 : 8 And other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
4 : 14 The sower soweth the word .
and not to be set on a candlestick ?
4 : 23 If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
4 : 24 And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
4 : 29 But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
4 : 31 It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that be in the earth : 4 : 32 But when it is sown , it groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it .
And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
I adjure thee by God , that thou torment me not .
5 : 13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave .
And the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ;) and were choked in the sea .
And they went out to see what it was that was done .
5 : 34 And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
And they were astonished with a great astonishment .
5 : 43 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat .
6 : 12 And they went out , and preached that men should repent .
And others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets .
6 : 21 And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of Galilee ; 6 : 22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee .
6 : 25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
6 : 26 And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath ' s sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
6 : 32 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately .
And they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
6 : 44 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
6 : 56 And whithersoever he entered , into villages , or cities , or country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole .
7 : 6 He answered and said unto them , Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
7 : 7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
7 : 12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ; 7 : 13 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
Do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it cannot defile him ; 7 : 19 Because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
7 : 20 And he said , That which cometh out of the man , that defileth the man .
7 : 24 And from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
7 : 25 For a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet : 7 : 26 The woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
7 : 30 And when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
8 : 4 And his disciples answered him , From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ?
8 : 6 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation .
8 : 18 Having eyes , see ye not ?
8 : 19 When I brake the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ?
They say unto him , Twelve .
8 : 21 And he said unto them , How is it that ye do not understand ?
8 : 24 And he looked up , and said , I see men as trees , walking .
8 : 28 And they answered , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others , One of the prophets .
And Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
9 : 1 And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
9 : 11 And they asked him , saying , Why say the scribes that Elias must first come ?
9 : 14 And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
9 : 26 And the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , He is dead .
9 : 27 But Jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
9 : 43 And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched : 9 : 44 Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
tempting him .
10 : 17 And when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him , 10 : 33 Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests , and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles : 10 : 34 And they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
11 : 6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
12 : 6 Having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son .
12 : 9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ?
12 : 12 And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
12 : 15 Shall we give , or shall we not give ?
But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
12 : 29 And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God is one Lord : 12 : 30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
12 : 32 And the scribe said unto him , Well , Master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one God ; and there is none other but he : 12 : 33 And to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
And the common people heard him gladly .
12 : 41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
13 : 7 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
13 : 8 For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
13 : 14 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand ,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains : 13 : 15 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house : 13 : 16 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment .
And they murmured against her .
14 : 15 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us .
14 : 16 And his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
14 : 22 And as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
14 : 23 And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
14 : 36 And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt .
14 : 41 And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
14 : 46 And they laid their hands on him , and took him .
Again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
14 : 62 And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
15 : 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
15 : 4 And Pilate asked him again , saying , Answerest thou nothing ?
behold how many things they witness against thee .
15 : 5 But Jesus yet answered nothing ; so that Pilate marvelled .
15 : 6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
15 : 10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
And they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him .
15 : 15 And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
15 : 24 And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
15 : 26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
15 : 32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe .
15 : 35 And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elias .
15 : 36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down .
15 : 42 And now when the even was come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath , 15 : 43 Joseph of Arimathaea , an honourable counsellor , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus .
16 : 2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
16 : 4 And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great .
16 : 7 But go your way , tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
16 : 10 And she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
1 : 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
1 : 30 And the angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found favour with God .
1 : 38 And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word .
1 : 39 And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ; 1 : 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth .
1 : 48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
1 : 67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying , 1 : 68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people , 1 : 69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ; 1 : 70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began : 1 : 71 That we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ; 1 : 72 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ; 1 : 73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham , 1 : 74 That he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear , 1 : 75 In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life .
2 : 25 And , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
2 : 33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
2 : 40 And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
2 : 44 But they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day ' s journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
2 : 47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
2 : 50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
2 : 51 And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
3 : 23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli , 3 : 24 Which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph , 3 : 25 Which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Amos , which was the son of Naum , which was the son of Esli , which was the son of Nagge , 3 : 26 Which was the son of Maath , which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Semei , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Juda , 3 : 27 Which was the son of Joanna , which was the son of Rhesa , which was the son of Zorobabel , which was the son of Salathiel , which was the son of Neri , 3 : 28 Which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of Er , 3 : 29 Which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eliezer , which was the son of Jorim , which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , 3 : 30 Which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of Juda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jonan , which was the son of Eliakim , 3 : 31 Which was the son of Melea , which was the son of Menan , which was the son of Mattatha , which was the son of Nathan , which was the son of David , 3 : 32 Which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of Salmon , which was the son of Naasson , 3 : 33 Which was the son of Aminadab , which was the son of Aram , which was the son of Esrom , which was the son of Phares , which was the son of Juda , 3 : 34 Which was the son of Jacob , which was the son of Isaac , which was the son of Abraham , which was the son of Thara , which was the son of Nachor , 3 : 35 Which was the son of Saruch , which was the son of Ragau , which was the son of Phalec , which was the son of Heber , which was the son of Sala , 3 : 36 Which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech , 3 : 37 Which was the son of Mathusala , which was the son of Enoch , which was the son of Jared , which was the son of Maleleel , which was the son of Cainan , 3 : 38 Which was the son of Enos , which was the son of Seth , which was the son of Adam , which was the son of God .
4 : 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence : 4 : 10 For it is written , He shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee : 4 : 11 And in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
4 : 13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season .
4 : 21 And he began to say unto them , This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears .
4 : 25 But I tell you of a truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ; 4 : 26 But unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
4 : 30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way , 4 : 31 And came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
4 : 40 Now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
4 : 41 And devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God .
And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ .
4 : 42 And when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
4 : 44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee .
5 : 6 And when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
5 : 14 And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
5 : 23 Whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
5 : 35 But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
6 : 1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands .
6 : 2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
6 : 22 Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man ' s sake .
6 : 24 But woe unto you that are rich !
6 : 40 The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
7 : 10 And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
7 : 28 For I say unto you , Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
7 : 31 And the Lord said , Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ?
7 : 37 And , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee ' s house , brought an alabaster box of ointment , 7 : 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
7 : 41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
7 : 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
7 : 50 And he said to the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace .
8 : 4 And when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable : 8 : 5 A sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
8 : 6 And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
8 : 17 For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
8 : 19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
8 : 20 And it was told him by certain which said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
And they launched forth .
8 : 23 But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
8 : 26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee .
8 : 29 ( For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man .
For oftentimes it had caught him : and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he brake the bands , and was driven of the devil into the wilderness .)
8 : 34 When they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
8 : 36 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
8 : 37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
And he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him .
When all denied , Peter and they that were with him said , Master , the multitude throng thee and press thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
8 : 49 While he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue ' s house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master .
8 : 51 And when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
8 : 56 And her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done .
9 : 9 And Herod said , John have I beheaded : but who is this , of whom I hear such things ?
9 : 12 And when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place .
9 : 14 For they were about five thousand men .
9 : 17 And they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
9 : 19 They answering said , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
9 : 20 He said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ?
9 : 26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father ' s , and of the holy angels .
9 : 28 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
9 : 29 And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
9 : 61 And another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
10 : 1 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come .
10 : 3 Go your ways : behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves .
10 : 6 And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
10 : 12 But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
10 : 13 Woe unto thee , Chorazin !
10 : 15 And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell .
11 : 2 And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name .
11 : 4 And forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us .
And lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
11 : 5 And he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say unto him , Friend , lend me three loaves ; 11 : 6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ?
And it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
11 : 19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ?
11 : 20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you .
for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
11 : 47 Woe unto you !
11 : 48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
12 : 3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
12 : 11 And when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say : 12 : 12 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say .
12 : 18 And he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods .
12 : 20 But God said unto him , Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
12 : 24 Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and God feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
12 : 29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
12 : 33 Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
12 : 40 Be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not .
12 : 42 And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
12 : 43 Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
12 : 45 But and if that servant say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ; 12 : 46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
12 : 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
12 : 57 Yea , and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
13 : 31 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Herod will kill thee .
13 : 33 Nevertheless I must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
14 : 8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ; 14 : 9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room .
14 : 18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse .
14 : 24 For I say unto you , That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper .
14 : 27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , cannot be my disciple .
15 : 8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
And he divided unto them his living .
And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore .
Ye cannot serve God and mammon .
16 : 24 And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
16 : 26 And beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
17 : 8 And will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
17 : 24 For as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
17 : 32 Remember Lot ' s wife .
17 : 36 Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
18 : 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
18 : 16 But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
18 : 27 And he said , The things which are impossible with men are possible with God .
18 : 38 And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
18 : 40 And Jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him , 18 : 41 Saying , What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ?
18 : 42 And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .
19 : 11 And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
19 : 13 And he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occupy till I come .
19 : 24 And he said unto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
19 : 28 And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to Jerusalem .
thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him .
19 : 35 And they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon .
20 : 1 And it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders , 20 : 2 And spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ?
20 : 13 Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ?
I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
20 : 18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
20 : 24 Shew me a penny .
20 : 29 There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
20 : 32 Last of all the woman died also .
21 : 2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
21 : 9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
22 : 5 And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
22 : 9 And they said unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare ?
22 : 14 And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
22 : 25 And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
And they said , Nothing .
And he said unto them , It is enough .
22 : 47 And while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him .
And Peter followed afar off .
And Peter said , Man , I am not .
And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
22 : 61 And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter .
22 : 63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him , and smote him .
22 : 66 And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying , 22 : 67 Art thou the Christ ?
23 : 3 And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
23 : 7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod ' s jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
23 : 22 And he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath he done ?
23 : 24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
23 : 38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
23 : 40 But the other answering rebuked him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
23 : 43 And Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , To day shalt thou be with me in paradise .
24 : 30 And it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
24 : 32 And they said one to another , Did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
24 : 39 Behold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
1 : 2 The same was in the beginning with God .
1 : 4 In him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
1 : 6 There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
1 : 12 But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name : 1 : 13 Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
1 : 14 And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father ,) full of grace and truth .
And he saith , I am not .
that we may give an answer to them that sent us .
1 : 31 And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
1 : 35 Again the next day after John stood , and two of his disciples ; 1 : 36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lamb of God !
1 : 38 Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ?
1 : 39 He saith unto them , Come and see .
They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour .
1 : 40 One of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter ' s brother .
1 : 50 Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ?
1 : 51 And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
2 : 8 And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast .
2 : 20 Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?
3 : 4 Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ?
can he enter the second time into his mother ' s womb , and be born ?
3 : 5 Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
3 : 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
3 : 10 Jesus answered and said unto him , Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not these things ?
3 : 16 For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
3 : 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
3 : 23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
3 : 24 For John was not yet cast into prison .
3 : 25 Then there arose a question between some of John ' s disciples and the Jews about purifying .
4 : 5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
4 : 8 ( For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat .)
4 : 11 The woman saith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
4 : 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
4 : 31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eat .
4 : 38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours .
4 : 40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
4 : 50 Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth .
And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
4 : 52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend .
5 : 18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that God was his Father , making himself equal with God .
5 : 20 For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
5 : 25 Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
5 : 40 And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life .
5 : 43 I am come in my Father ' s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
6 : 6 And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
Now there was much grass in the place .
6 : 15 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
6 : 18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
6 : 20 But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid .
6 : 25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
6 : 29 Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
what dost thou work ?
6 : 35 And Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
6 : 36 But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not .
6 : 37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
6 : 39 And this is the Father ' s will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
6 : 40 And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
6 : 42 And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ?
6 : 44 No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
6 : 66 From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
6 : 67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve , Will ye also go away ?
7 : 11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
7 : 12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
7 : 19 Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ?
7 : 23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
7 : 43 So there was a division among the people because of him .
7 : 44 And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
7 : 50 Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them ,) 7 : 51 Doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
8 : 13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him , Thou bearest record of thyself ; thy record is not true .
8 : 16 And yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
because he saith , Whither I go , ye cannot come .
8 : 29 And he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him .
8 : 36 If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
Then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
8 : 54 Jesus answered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God : 8 : 55 Yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
8 : 57 Then said the Jews unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
9 : 9 Some said , This is he : others said , He is like him : but he said , I am he .
He said , I know not .
He said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
9 : 16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the sabbath day .
And there was a division among them .
how opened he thine eyes ?
9 : 27 He answered them , I have told you already , and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ?
will ye also be his disciples ?
9 : 31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
9 : 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
And he worshipped him .
9 : 41 Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remaineth .
10 : 15 As the Father knoweth me , even so know I the Father : and I lay down my life for the sheep .
10 : 18 No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself .
10 : 22 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter .
10 : 31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him .
10 : 35 If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came , and the scripture cannot be broken ; 10 : 36 Say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
10 : 41 And many resorted unto him , and said , John did no miracle : but all things that John spake of this man were true .
11 : 5 Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
If any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
11 : 10 But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
11 : 12 Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
11 : 14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
11 : 15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
11 : 16 Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
11 : 17 Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
11 : 18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off : 11 : 19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
11 : 28 And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
11 : 33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled .
11 : 37 And some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
11 : 47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council , and said , What do we ?
11 : 57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
12 : 12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , 12 : 13 Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord .
12 : 32 And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
12 : 35 Then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you .
12 : 42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue : 12 : 43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
12 : 46 I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
12 : 49 For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
13 : 2 And supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon ' s son , to betray him ; 13 : 3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ; 13 : 4 He riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
13 : 16 Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
13 : 20 Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
13 : 21 When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
14 : 1 Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me .
14 : 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
14 : 11 Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
14 : 12 Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
14 : 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
14 : 15 If ye love me , keep my commandments .
14 : 20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
14 : 21 He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
15 : 5 I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
15 : 13 Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
15 : 14 Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever I command you .
15 : 15 Henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
16 : 2 They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service .
16 : 3 And these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor me .
16 : 22 And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
16 : 23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
17 : 6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word .
17 : 13 And now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
17 : 24 Father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
17 : 26 And I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
18 : 5 They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth .
18 : 7 Then asked he them again , Whom seek ye ?
And they said , Jesus of Nazareth .
18 : 18 And the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
The Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death : 18 : 32 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
19 : 5 Then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe .
Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
19 : 7 The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ?
19 : 16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified .
19 : 20 This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
19 : 26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
19 : 32 Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
19 : 36 For these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken .
19 : 37 And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced .
20 : 9 For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
whom seekest thou ?
They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
21 : 7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord .
21 : 8 And the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits ,) dragging the net with fishes .
21 : 11 Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , an hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
21 : 15 So when they had dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me more than these ?
He saith unto him , Feed my lambs .
21 : 18 Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdest thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
1 : 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brethren .
2 : 7 And they were all amazed and marvelled , saying one to another , Behold , are not all these which speak Galilaeans ?
2 : 37 Now when they heard this , they were pricked in their heart , and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles , Men and brethren , what shall we do ?
2 : 39 For the promise is unto you , and to your children , and to all that are afar off , even as many as the LORD our God shall call .
And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
3 : 11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon ' s , greatly wondering .
3 : 17 And now , brethren , I wot that through ignorance ye did it , as did also your rulers .
3 : 18 But those things , which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer , he hath so fulfilled .
3 : 23 And it shall come to pass , that every soul , which will not hear that prophet , shall be destroyed from among the people .
3 : 24 Yea , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
3 : 25 Ye are the children of the prophets , and of the covenant which God made with our fathers , saying unto Abraham , And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed .
4 : 1 And as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees , came upon them , 4 : 2 Being grieved that they taught the people , and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
4 : 4 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
4 : 15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves , 4 : 16 Saying , What shall we do to these men ?
4 : 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
4 : 24 And when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , thou art God , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is : 4 : 25 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said , Why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things ?
4 : 31 And when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
5 : 11 And great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things .
5 : 22 But when the officers came , and found them not in the prison , they returned and told , 5 : 23 Saying , The prison truly found we shut with all safety , and the keepers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened , we found no man within .
5 : 27 And when they had brought them , they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them , 5 : 28 Saying , Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ?
5 : 38 And now I say unto you , Refrain from these men , and let them alone : for if this counsel or this work be of men , it will come to nought : 5 : 39 But if it be of God , ye cannot overthrow it ; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God .
6 : 4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer , and to the ministry of the word .
7 : 1 Then said the high priest , Are these things so ?
7 : 5 And he gave him none inheritance in it , no , not so much as to set his foot on : yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession , and to his seed after him , when as yet he had no child .
7 : 19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
7 : 20 In which time Moses was born , and was exceeding fair , and nourished up in his father ' s house three months : 7 : 21 And when he was cast out , Pharaoh ' s daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers : 7 : 53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels , and have not kept it .
And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria , except the apostles .
8 : 5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and preached Christ unto them .
8 : 6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
8 : 11 And to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
8 : 25 And they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans .
8 : 32 The place of the scripture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth : 8 : 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ?
9 : 17 And Ananias went his way , and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said , Brother Saul , the Lord , even Jesus , that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest , hath sent me , that thou mightest receive thy sight , and be filled with the Holy Ghost .
9 : 19 And when he had received meat , he was strengthened .
9 : 20 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues , that he is the Son of God .
9 : 21 But all that heard him were amazed , and said ; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem , and came hither for that intent , that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
9 : 33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
10 : 14 But Peter said , Not so , Lord ; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean .
10 : 15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
10 : 21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius ; and said , Behold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
And on the morrow Peter went away with them , and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
Then answered Peter , 10 : 47 Can any man forbid water , that these should not be baptized , which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we ?
11 : 1 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
11 : 7 And I heard a voice saying unto me , Arise , Peter ; slay and eat .
11 : 8 But I said , Not so , Lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
11 : 22 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem : and they sent forth Barnabas , that he should go as far as Antioch .
11 : 25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus , for to seek Saul : 11 : 26 And when he had found him , he brought him unto Antioch .
And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch .
12 : 18 Now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of Peter .
13 : 2 As they ministered to the Lord , and fasted , the Holy Ghost said , Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them .
13 : 18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness .
13 : 29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a sepulchre .
13 : 32 And we declare unto you glad tidings , how that the promise which was made unto the fathers , 13 : 33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children , in that he hath raised up Jesus again ; as it is also written in the second psalm , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee .
13 : 38 Be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins : 13 : 39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses .
13 : 48 And when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
14 : 2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles , and made their minds evil affected against the brethren .
14 : 3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord , which gave testimony unto the word of his grace , and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
14 : 4 But the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the Jews , and part with the apostles .
14 : 11 And when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Lycaonia , The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men .
We also are men of like passions with you , and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God , which made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all things that are therein : 14 : 16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways .
14 : 19 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium , who persuaded the people , and having stoned Paul , drew him out of the city , supposing he had been dead .
14 : 23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
14 : 25 And when they had preached the word in Perga , they went down into Attalia : 14 : 26 And thence sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
15 : 4 And when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
15 : 7 And when there had been much disputing , Peter rose up , and said unto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us , that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
15 : 12 Then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
15 : 19 Wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the Gentiles are turned to God : 15 : 20 But that we write unto them , that they abstain from pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and from things strangled , and from blood .
15 : 38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them , who departed from them from Pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
16 : 8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas .
16 : 9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; There stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come over into Macedonia , and help us .
16 : 11 Therefore loosing from Troas , we came with a straight course to Samothracia , and the next day to Neapolis ; 16 : 12 And from thence to Philippi , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
17 : 4 And some of them believed , and consorted with Paul and Silas ; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude , and of the chief women not a few .
17 : 18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans , and of the Stoicks , encountered him .
And some said , What will this babbler say ?
17 : 23 For as I passed by , and beheld your devotions , I found an altar with this inscription , TO THE UNKNOWN GOD .
17 : 24 God that made the world and all things therein , seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ; 17 : 25 Neither is worshipped with men ' s hands , as though he needed any thing , seeing he giveth to all life , and breath , and all things ; 17 : 26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ; 17 : 27 That they should seek the Lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us : 17 : 28 For in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring .
17 : 34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him , and believed : among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
18 : 1 After these things Paul departed from Athens , and came to Corinth ; 18 : 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus , lately come from Italy , with his wife Priscilla ; ( because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome :) and came unto them .
18 : 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath , and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks .
18 : 5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia , Paul was pressed in the spirit , and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ .
18 : 9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision , Be not afraid , but speak , and hold not thy peace : 18 : 10 For I am with thee , and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee : for I have much people in this city .
18 : 12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia , the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat , 18 : 13 Saying , This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law .
And Gallio cared for none of those things .
And he sailed from Ephesus .
18 : 24 And a certain Jew named Apollos , born at Alexandria , an eloquent man , and mighty in the scriptures , came to Ephesus .
18 : 25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
19 : 4 Then said Paul , John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying unto the people , that they should believe on him which should come after him , that is , on Christ Jesus .
19 : 5 When they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
19 : 6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them , the Holy Ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .
19 : 11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul : 19 : 12 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out of them .
19 : 13 Then certain of the vagabond Jews , exorcists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus , saying , We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth .
19 : 23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way .
19 : 24 For a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , which made silver shrines for Diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ; 19 : 25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation , and said , Sirs , ye know that by this craft we have our wealth .
19 : 28 And when they heard these sayings , they were full of wrath , and cried out , saying , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
19 : 30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
19 : 34 But when they knew that he was a Jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
19 : 39 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters , it shall be determined in a lawful assembly .
20 : 2 And when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into Greece , 20 : 3 And there abode three months .
And when the Jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sail into Syria , he purposed to return through Macedonia .
20 : 17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called the elders of the church .
20 : 29 For I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
20 : 34 Yea , ye yourselves know , that these hands have ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
20 : 36 And when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down , and prayed with them all .
21 : 8 And the next day we that were of Paul ' s company departed , and came unto Caesarea : and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
21 : 25 As touching the Gentiles which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
21 : 26 Then Paul took the men , and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple , to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
21 : 27 And when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him , 21 : 28 Crying out , Men of Israel , help : This is the man , that teacheth all men every where against the people , and the law , and this place : and further brought Greeks also into the temple , and hath polluted this holy place .
21 : 35 And when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
22 : 2 ( And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith ,) 22 : 3 I am verily a man which am a Jew , born in Tarsus , a city in Cilicia , yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel , and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers , and was zealous toward God , as ye all are this day .
22 : 4 And I persecuted this way unto the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
22 : 27 Then the chief captain came , and said unto him , Tell me , art thou a Roman ?
And Paul said , But I was free born .
23 : 3 Then said Paul unto him , God shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
23 : 10 And when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
23 : 20 And he said , The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council , as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly .
23 : 22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart , and charged him , See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me .
24 : 7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us , and with great violence took him away out of our hands , 24 : 8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee : by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things , whereof we accuse him .
24 : 25 And as he reasoned of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come , Felix trembled , and answered , Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season , I will call for thee .
25 : 7 And when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
25 : 11 For if I be an offender , or have committed any thing worthy of death , I refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me , no man may deliver me unto them .
unto Caesar shalt thou go .
25 : 17 Therefore , when they were come hither , without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
25 : 23 And on the morrow , when Agrippa was come , and Bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at Festus ' commandment Paul was brought forth .
26 : 12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests , 26 : 13 At midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
26 : 27 King Agrippa , believest thou the prophets ?
27 : 1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus ' band .
And Julius courteously entreated Paul , and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself .
27 : 4 And when we had launched from thence , we sailed under Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
27 : 14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind , called Euroclydon .
27 : 20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
27 : 21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , Sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from Crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
27 : 32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
27 : 36 Then were they all of good cheer , and they also took some meat .
27 : 42 And the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
28 : 9 So when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were healed : 28 : 10 Who also honoured us with many honours ; and when we departed , they laded us with such things as were necessary .
28 : 19 But when the Jews spake against it , I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar ; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of .
28 : 22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest : for as concerning this sect , we know that every where it is spoken against .
1 : 8 First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
1 : 9 For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers ; 1 : 10 Making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
1 : 11 For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ; 1 : 12 That is , that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
1 : 18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ; 1 : 19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them ; for God hath shewed it unto them .
2 : 2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
2 : 12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ; 2 : 13 ( For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
2 : 21 Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ?
thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
3 : 1 What advantage then hath the Jew ?
3 : 2 Much every way : chiefly , because that unto them were committed the oracles of God .
( I speak as a man ) 3 : 6 God forbid : for then how shall God judge the world ?
3 : 9 What then ?
3 : 13 Their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps is under their lips : 3 : 14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness : 3 : 15 Their feet are swift to shed blood : 3 : 16 Destruction and misery are in their ways : 3 : 17 And the way of peace have they not known : 3 : 18 There is no fear of God before their eyes .
Nay : but by the law of faith .
3 : 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law .
God forbid : yea , we establish the law .
4 : 2 For if Abraham were justified by works , he hath whereof to glory ; but not before God .
4 : 4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace , but of debt .
4 : 8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin .
when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ?
5 : 1 Therefore being justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ : 5 : 2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
5 : 17 For if by one man ' s offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ .)
6 : 7 For he that is dead is freed from sin .
6 : 23 For the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
7 : 6 But now we are delivered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held ; that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
Is the law sin ?
7 : 12 Wherefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good .
God forbid .
7 : 17 Now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
8 : 6 For to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
8 : 16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God : 8 : 17 And if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint - heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
8 : 28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
If God be for us , who can be against us ?
8 : 32 He that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
It is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
8 : 36 As it is written , For thy sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter .
9 : 16 So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that sheweth mercy .
For who hath resisted his will ?
9 : 27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel , Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved : 9 : 28 For he will finish the work , and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth .
That the Gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
10 : 8 But what saith it ?
and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
10 : 15 And how shall they preach , except they be sent ?
First Moses saith , I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation I will anger you .
11 : 2 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew .
how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying , 11 : 3 Lord , they have killed thy prophets , and digged down thine altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life .
11 : 12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
11 : 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
11 : 33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God !
12 : 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ; 12 : 7 Or ministry , let us wait on our ministering : or he that teacheth , on teaching ; 12 : 8 Or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
12 : 9 Let love be without dissimulation .
12 : 10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love ; in honour preferring one another ; 12 : 11 Not slothful in business ; fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord ; 12 : 12 Rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; continuing instant in prayer ; 12 : 13 Distributing to the necessity of saints ; given to hospitality .
12 : 21 Be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good .
For there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God .
13 : 2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
13 : 11 And that , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awake out of sleep : for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed .
to his own master he standeth or falleth .
14 : 5 One man esteemeth one day above another : another esteemeth every day alike .
14 : 6 He that regardeth the day , regardeth it unto the Lord ; and he that regardeth not the day , to the Lord he doth not regard it .
or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ?
14 : 21 It is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth .
14 : 23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat , because he eateth not of faith : for whatsoever is not of faith is sin .
15 : 2 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification .
15 : 3 For even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
15 : 5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus : 15 : 6 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
15 : 11 And again , Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles ; and laud him , all ye people .
15 : 23 But now having no more place in these parts , and having a great desire these many years to come unto you ; 15 : 24 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain , I will come to you : for I trust to see you in my journey , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , if first I be somewhat filled with your company .
15 : 27 It hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are .
15 : 28 When therefore I have performed this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spain .
15 : 29 And I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
16 : 1 I commend unto you Phebe our sister , which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea : 16 : 2 That ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .
Salute my well - beloved Epaenetus , who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ .
16 : 8 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord .
Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus , which are in the Lord .
16 : 17 Now I beseech you , brethren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned ; and avoid them .
16 : 23 Gaius mine host , and of the whole church , saluteth you .
Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you , and Quartus a brother .
1 : 4 I thank my God always on your behalf , for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ ; 1 : 5 That in every thing ye are enriched by him , in all utterance , and in all knowledge ; 1 : 6 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you : 1 : 7 So that ye come behind in no gift ; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ : 1 : 8 Who shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
1 : 12 Now this I say , that every one of you saith , I am of Paul ; and I of Apollos ; and I of Cephas ; and I of Christ .
1 : 16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas : besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
1 : 18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
1 : 30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus , who of God is made unto us wisdom , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption : 1 : 31 That , according as it is written , He that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord .
2 : 12 Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
2 : 13 Which things also we speak , not in the words which man ' s wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
2 : 14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
3 : 1 And I , brethren , could not speak unto you as unto spiritual , but as unto carnal , even as unto babes in Christ .
3 : 16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
3 : 17 If any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
3 : 18 Let no man deceive himself .
4 : 7 For who maketh thee to differ from another ?
4 : 9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last , as it were appointed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
4 : 11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwellingplace ; 4 : 12 And labour , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it : 4 : 13 Being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of meekness ?
5 : 7 Purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , as ye are unleavened .
5 : 12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without ?
Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person .
6 : 8 Nay , ye do wrong , and defraud , and that your brethren .
6 : 11 And such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
And so ordain I in all churches .
Is any called in uncircumcision ?
seek not a wife .
7 : 28 But and if thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned .
The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit : but she that is married careth for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
8 : 2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing , he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know .
8 : 9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your ' s become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
9 : 1 Am I not an apostle ?
9 : 10 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes ?
9 : 12 If others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ?
and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar ?
9 : 14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel .
9 : 24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ?
9 : 26 I therefore so run , not as uncertainly ; so fight I , not as one that beateth the air : 9 : 27 But I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
10 : 1 Moreover , brethren , I would not that ye should be ignorant , how that all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ; 10 : 2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea ; 10 : 3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat ; 10 : 4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink : for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them : and that Rock was Christ .
10 : 14 Wherefore , my dearly beloved , flee from idolatry .
that the idol is any thing , or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing ?
are we stronger than he ?
10 : 24 Let no man seek his own , but every man another ' s wealth .
10 : 27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
11 : 1 Be ye followers of me , even as I also am of Christ .
11 : 8 For the man is not of the woman : but the woman of the man .
11 : 14 Doth not even nature itself teach you , that , if a man have long hair , it is a shame unto him ?
11 : 18 For first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
11 : 19 For there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
or despise ye the church of God , and shame them that have not ?
11 : 26 For as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the Lord ' s death till he come .
11 : 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
11 : 28 But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
11 : 30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
11 : 33 Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
12 : 5 And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
12 : 6 And there are diversities of operations , but it is the same God which worketh all in all .
are all prophets ?
13 : 10 But when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part shall be done away .
14 : 2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto God : for no man understandeth him ; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
14 : 10 There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
14 : 26 How is it then , brethren ?
came the word of God out from you ?
15 : 1 Moreover , brethren , I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you , which also ye have received , and wherein ye stand ; 15 : 2 By which also ye are saved , if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you , unless ye have believed in vain .
15 : 12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
15 : 26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .
15 : 35 But some man will say , How are the dead raised up ?
15 : 40 There are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
It is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption : 15 : 43 It is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power : 15 : 44 It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body .
15 : 49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
15 : 50 Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
O grave , where is thy victory ?
16 : 14 Let all your things be done with charity .
Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
16 : 21 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand .
1 : 15 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before , that ye might have a second benefit ; 1 : 16 And to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea .
1 : 17 When I therefore was thus minded , did I use lightness ?
1 : 21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ; 1 : 22 Who hath also sealed us , and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
2 : 17 For we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
3 : 11 For if that which is done away was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
3 : 15 But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the vail is upon their heart .
5 : 1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved , we have a building of God , an house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
5 : 9 Wherefore we labour , that , whether present or absent , we may be accepted of him .
5 : 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
5 : 11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
5 : 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him .
6 : 12 Ye are not straitened in us , but ye are straitened in your own bowels .
6 : 18 And will be a Father unto you , and ye shall be my sons and daughters , saith the Lord Almighty .
8 : 6 Insomuch that we desired Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also finish in you the same grace also .
8 : 12 For if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
8 : 23 Whether any do enquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be enquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
9 : 6 But this I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
10 : 13 But we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
11 : 3 But I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
11 : 11 Wherefore ?
11 : 13 For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
11 : 18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also .
Are they the seed of Abraham ?
so am I .
12 : 17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you ?
walked we not in the same steps ?
In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established .
For we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
13 : 7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil ; not that we should appear approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as reprobates .
1 : 6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel : 1 : 7 Which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of Christ .
1 : 13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it : 1 : 14 And profited in the Jews ' religion above many my equals in mine own nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .
2 : 6 But of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( whatsoever they were , it maketh no matter to me : God accepteth no man ' s person :) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me : 2 : 7 But contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter ; 2 : 8 ( For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles :) 2 : 9 And when James , Cephas , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the heathen , and they unto the circumcision .
2 : 21 I do not frustrate the grace of God : for if righteousness come by the law , then Christ is dead in vain .
3 : 7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
3 : 12 And the law is not of faith : but , The man that doeth them shall live in them .
3 : 15 Brethren , I speak after the manner of men ; Though it be but a man ' s covenant , yet if it be confirmed , no man disannulleth , or addeth thereto .
3 : 17 And this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , cannot disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
3 : 19 Wherefore then serveth the law ?
3 : 20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one .
3 : 29 And if ye be Christ ' s , then are ye Abraham ' s seed , and heirs according to the promise .
4 : 11 I am afraid of you , lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain .
4 : 17 They zealously affect you , but not well ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
5 : 1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
5 : 9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
6 : 2 Bear ye one another ' s burdens , and so fulfil the law of Christ .
6 : 11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand .
6 : 12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
1 : 1 Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , to the saints which are at Ephesus , and to the faithful in Christ Jesus : 1 : 2 Grace be to you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
1 : 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ : 1 : 4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love : 1 : 5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will , 1 : 6 To the praise of the glory of his grace , wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved .
1 : 15 Wherefore I also , after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus , and love unto all the saints , 1 : 16 Cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ; 1 : 17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him : 1 : 18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened ; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints , 1 : 19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us - ward who believe , according to the working of his mighty power , 1 : 20 Which he wrought in Christ , when he raised him from the dead , and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places , 1 : 21 Far above all principality , and power , and might , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come : 1 : 22 And hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church , 1 : 23 Which is his body , the fulness of him that filleth all in all .
4 : 1 I therefore , the prisoner of the Lord , beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called , 4 : 2 With all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ; 4 : 3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
4 : 7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
4 : 8 Wherefore he saith , When he ascended up on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
4 : 10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens , that he might fill all things .)
5 : 17 Wherefore be ye not unwise , but understanding what the will of the Lord is .
5 : 25 Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ; 5 : 26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word , 5 : 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
6 : 12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
1 : 3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you , 1 : 4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy , 1 : 5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now ; 1 : 6 Being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ : 1 : 7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; inasmuch as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are partakers of my grace .
1 : 8 For God is my record , how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ .
1 : 12 But I would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel ; 1 : 13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace , and in all other places ; 1 : 14 And many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
1 : 22 But if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
1 : 25 And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith ; 1 : 26 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again .
2 : 12 Wherefore , my beloved , as ye have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
2 : 23 Him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
4 : 3 And I intreat thee also , true yokefellow , help those women which laboured with me in the gospel , with Clement also , and with other my fellowlabourers , whose names are in the book of life .
4 : 7 And the peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus .
Amen .
4 : 23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
2 : 9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily .
3 : 4 When Christ , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in glory .
3 : 15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to the which also ye are called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
4 : 6 Let your speech be alway with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
4 : 7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord : 4 : 8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfort your hearts ; 4 : 9 With Onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you .
4 : 13 For I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
4 : 14 Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas , greet you .
1 : 8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God - ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
2 : 3 For our exhortation was not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile : 2 : 4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
2 : 10 Ye are witnesses , and God also , how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe : 2 : 11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you , as a father doth his children , 2 : 12 That ye would walk worthy of God , who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory .
4 : 3 For this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication : 4 : 4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour ; 4 : 5 Not in the lust of concupiscence , even as the Gentiles which know not God : 4 : 6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter : because that the Lord is the avenger of all such , as we also have forewarned you and testified .
5 : 3 For when they shall say , Peace and safety ; then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape .
5 : 7 For they that sleep sleep in the night ; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night .
5 : 16 Rejoice evermore .
5 : 18 In every thing give thanks : for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you .
Amen .
1 : 11 Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power : 1 : 12 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you , and ye in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
2 : 1 Now we beseech you , brethren , by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and by our gathering together unto him , 2 : 2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind , or be troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter as from us , as that the day of Christ is at hand .
2 : 3 Let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ; 2 : 4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God , or that is worshipped ; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God , shewing himself that he is God .
2 : 6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time .
2 : 8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed , whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth , and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming : 2 : 9 Even him , whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders , 2 : 10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
1 : 1 Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour , and Lord Jesus Christ , which is our hope ; 1 : 2 Unto Timothy , my own son in the faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord .
1 : 14 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
1 : 15 This is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
2 : 5 For there is one God , and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ; 2 : 6 Who gave himself a ransom for all , to be testified in due time .
3 : 7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
4 : 1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of devils ; 4 : 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy ; having their conscience seared with a hot iron ; 4 : 3 Forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth .
4 : 13 Till I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine .
5 : 1 Rebuke not an elder , but intreat him as a father ; and the younger men as brethren ; 5 : 2 The elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , with all purity .
5 : 8 But if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
5 : 9 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man .
5 : 11 But the younger widows refuse : for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ , they will marry ; 5 : 12 Having damnation , because they have cast off their first faith .
5 : 16 If any man or woman that believeth have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
5 : 18 For the scripture saith , Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn .
6 : 9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare , and into many foolish and hurtful lusts , which drown men in destruction and perdition .
Grace be with thee .
1 : 14 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us .
2 : 2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
2 : 5 And if a man also strive for masteries , yet is he not crowned , except he strive lawfully .
2 : 16 But shun profane and vain babblings : for they will increase unto more ungodliness .
2 : 19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure , having this seal , The Lord knoweth them that are his .
3 : 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy , 3 : 3 Without natural affection , trucebreakers , false accusers , incontinent , fierce , despisers of those that are good , 3 : 4 Traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ; 3 : 5 Having a form of godliness , but denying the power thereof : from such turn away .
3 : 9 But they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be manifest unto all men , as their ' s also was .
3 : 10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine , manner of life , purpose , faith , longsuffering , charity , patience , 3 : 11 Persecutions , afflictions , which came unto me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; what persecutions I endured : but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
3 : 12 Yea , and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution .
3 : 13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse , deceiving , and being deceived .
4 : 6 For I am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand .
Eubulus greeteth thee , and Pudens , and Linus , and Claudia , and all the brethren .
1 : 5 For this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee : 1 : 6 If any be blameless , the husband of one wife , having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly .
1 : 16 They profess that they know God ; but in works they deny him , being abominable , and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .
2 : 6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded .
These things are good and profitable unto men .
1 : 21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee , knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say .
And again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
1 : 6 And again , when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world , he saith , And let all the angels of God worship him .
1 : 9 Thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
3 : 13 But exhort one another daily , while it is called To day ; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
3 : 16 For some , when they had heard , did provoke : howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
3 : 19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief .
4 : 2 For unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
4 : 4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
4 : 5 And in this place again , If they shall enter into my rest .
4 : 10 For he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his .
4 : 13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
5 : 3 And by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
6 : 1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God , 6 : 2 Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
7 : 1 For this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ; 7 : 2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation King of righteousness , and after that also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ; 7 : 3 Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually .
7 : 7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better .
7 : 18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof .
8 : 8 For finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah : 8 : 9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because they continued not in my covenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
8 : 10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people : 8 : 11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .
9 : 11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ; 9 : 12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
9 : 24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us : 9 : 25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ; 9 : 26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
10 : 8 Above when he said , Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ; 10 : 9 Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God .
And again , The Lord shall judge his people .
10 : 34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
10 : 35 Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward .
10 : 39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
11 : 2 For by it the elders obtained a good report .
11 : 24 By faith Moses , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ' s daughter ; 11 : 25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ; 11 : 26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward .
12 : 1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses , let us lay aside every weight , and the sin which doth so easily beset us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us , 12 : 2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
12 : 4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin .
12 : 17 For ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears .
12 : 18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , nor unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest , 12 : 19 And the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more : 12 : 20 ( For they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart : 12 : 21 And so terrible was the sight , that Moses said , I exceedingly fear and quake :) 12 : 22 But ye are come unto mount Sion , and unto the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to an innumerable company of angels , 12 : 23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn , which are written in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect , 12 : 24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things than that of Abel .
13 : 3 Remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity , as being yourselves also in the body .
13 : 4 Marriage is honourable in all , and the bed undefiled : but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge .
13 : 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday , and to day , and for ever .
13 : 11 For the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
13 : 17 Obey them that have the rule over you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give account , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
13 : 18 Pray for us : for we trust we have a good conscience , in all things willing to live honestly .
The General Epistle of James
1 : 4 But let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
1 : 6 But let him ask in faith , nothing wavering .
1 : 13 Let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God cannot be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man : 1 : 14 But every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
1 : 15 Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
1 : 16 Do not err , my beloved brethren .
1 : 23 For if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass : 1 : 24 For he beholdeth himself , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
2 : 13 For he shall have judgment without mercy , that hath shewed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment .
2 : 19 Thou believest that there is one God ; thou doest well : the devils also believe , and tremble .
2 : 23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith , Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
2 : 24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
2 : 26 For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh .
3 : 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish .
3 : 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be intreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
come they not hence , even of your lusts that war in your members ?
4 : 3 Ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may consume it upon your lusts .
4 : 7 Submit yourselves therefore to God .
4 : 11 Speak not evil one of another , brethren .
4 : 13 Go to now , ye that say , To day or to morrow we will go into such a city , and continue there a year , and buy and sell , and get gain : 4 : 14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow .
It is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
4 : 17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
5 : 2 Your riches are corrupted , and your garments are motheaten .
5 : 4 Behold , the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth : and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth .
5 : 12 But above all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by heaven , neither by the earth , neither by any other oath : but let your yea be yea ; and your nay , nay ; lest ye fall into condemnation .
let him sing psalms .
5 : 16 Confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed .
And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you .
Love the brotherhood .
3 : 5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands : 3 : 6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
3 : 7 Likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
4 : 11 If any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of God ; if any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which God giveth : that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever .
5 : 1 The elders which are among you I exhort , who am also an elder , and a witness of the sufferings of Christ , and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed : 5 : 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ; 5 : 3 Neither as being lords over God ' s heritage , but being ensamples to the flock .
5 : 5 Likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder .
5 : 13 The church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son .
1 : 13 Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ; 1 : 14 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me .
1 : 15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance .
3 : 5 For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water : 3 : 6 Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished : 3 : 7 But the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
3 : 8 But , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
3 : 11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness , 3 : 12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God , wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ?
3 : 14 Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
To him be glory both now and for ever .
And if any man sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous : 2 : 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins : and not for our ' s only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
3 : 12 Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother .
Because his own works were evil , and his brother ' s righteous .
He that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
4 : 1 Beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of God : because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
4 : 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
4 : 16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us .
4 : 17 Herein is our love made perfect , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment : because as he is , so are we in this world .
4 : 20 If a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
5 : 13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
5 : 17 All unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
5 : 19 And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
1 : 6 And this is love , that we walk after his commandments .
1 : 7 For many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh .
Amen .
1 : 10 Wherefore , if I come , I will remember his deeds which he doeth , prating against us with malicious words : and not content therewith , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and forbiddeth them that would , and casteth them out of the church .
1 : 3 Beloved , when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you , and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints .
1 : 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed them that believed not .
1 : 9 Yet Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
1 : 24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling , and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy , 1 : 25 To the only wise God our Saviour , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and ever .
Amen .
Even so , Amen .
2 : 5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will remove thy candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
2 : 7 He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
2 : 22 Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
2 : 28 And I will give him the morning star .
3 : 1 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
3 : 4 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
3 : 7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ; 3 : 8 I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
3 : 10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
3 : 13 He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
4 : 7 And the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
5 : 8 And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
6 : 7 And when he had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , Come and see .
7 : 4 And I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
7 : 7 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
7 : 8 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand .
Amen .
and whence came they ?
And he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
8 : 13 And I beheld , and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe , to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels , which are yet to sound !
9 : 6 And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
9 : 9 And they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
9 : 13 And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God , 9 : 14 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
9 : 16 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
11 : 14 The second woe is past ; and , behold , the third woe cometh quickly .
11 : 16 And the four and twenty elders , which sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces , and worshipped God , 11 : 17 Saying , We give thee thanks , O LORD God Almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
12 : 4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
13 : 3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death ; and his deadly wound was healed : and all the world wondered after the beast .
13 : 7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations .
13 : 15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
These were redeemed from among men , being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb .
14 : 6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation , and kindred , and tongue , and people , 14 : 7 Saying with a loud voice , Fear God , and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and worship him that made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the fountains of waters .
14 : 15 And another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thrust in thy sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
14 : 17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
15 : 1 And I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
16 : 12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
16 : 16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon .
I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
17 : 15 And he saith unto me , The waters which thou sawest , where the whore sitteth , are peoples , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues .
for in one hour is thy judgment come .
18 : 17 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought .
18 : 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets , and of saints , and of all that were slain upon the earth .
19 : 10 And I fell at his feet to worship him .
19 : 15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the nations : and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God .
19 : 17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ; 19 : 18 That ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great .
20 : 15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire .
I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end .
22 : 6 And he said unto me , These sayings are faithful and true : and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done .
And let him that heareth say , Come .
22 : 20 He which testifieth these things saith , Surely I come quickly .
Even so , come , Lord Jesus .
SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE and THE BOOK of THEL
So I piped with merry cheer .
" Piper , pipe that song again ;" So I piped : he wept to hear .
How sweet is the Shepherd ' s sweet lot !
Little Lamb , who made thee ?
When I from black and he from white cloud free , And round the tent of God like lambs we joy
-- That thousands of sweepers , Dick , Joe , Ned , and Jack , Were all of them locked up in coffins of black .
THE LITTLE BOY LOST
Sweet moan , sweeter smile , All the dovelike moans beguile .
For Mercy has a human heart Pity , a human face ; And Love , the human form divine ; And Peace , the human dress .
Seated in companies they sit , with radiance all their own .
The hum of multitudes was there , but multitudes of lambs , Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands .
NIGHT
When wolves and tigers howl for prey , They pitying stand and weep ; Seeking to drive their thirst away , And keep them from the sheep .
Sweet Joy I call thee : Thou dost smile , I sing the while ; Sweet joy befall thee !
Once a dream did weave a shade O ' er my angel - guarded bed , That an emmet lost its way Where on grass methought I lay .
And not sit beside the next , Pouring pity in their breast , And not sit the cradle near , Weeping tear on infant ' s tear ?
And not sit both night and day , Wiping all our tears away ?
Oh no !
" O Earth , O Earth , return !
" Break this heavy chain , That does freeze my bones around !
THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE
It is a land of poverty !
For where ' er the sun does shine , And where ' er the rain does fall , Babes should never hunger there , Nor poverty the mind appall .
And her breast did lick And upon her neck , From his eyes of flame , Ruby tears there came ;
Tired and woe - begone , Hoarse with making moan , Arm in arm , seven days They traced the desert ways .
Seven nights they sleep Among shadows deep , And dream they see their child Starved in desert wild .
Rising from unrest , The trembling woman presse With feet of weary woe ; She could no further go .
To this day they dwell In a lonely dell , Nor fear the wolvish howl Nor the lion ' s growl .
" Where are thy father and mother ?
And that I was a maiden Queen Guarded by an Angel mild : Witless woe was ne ' er beguiled !
Tiger , tiger , burning bright In the forest of the night , What immortal hand or eye Could Frame thy fearful symmetry ?
On what wings dare he aspire ?
And what shoulder and what art Could twist the sinews of thy heart ?
what the chain ?
Then I went to my pretty rose tree , To tend her by day and by night ; But my rose turned away with jealousy , And her thorns were my only delight .
THE LILY
THE GARDEN OF LOVE
And I saw it was filled with graves , And tombstones where flowers should be ; And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds , And binding with briars my joys and desires .
And God , like a father , rejoicing to see His children as pleasant and happy as he , Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel , But kiss him , and give him both drink and apparel .
LONDON
I wandered through each chartered street , Near where the chartered Thames does flow , A mark in every face I meet , Marks of weakness , marks of woe .
In every cry of every man , In every infant ' s cry of fear , In every voice , in every ban , The mind - forged manacles I hear :
But most , through midnight streets I hear How the youthful harlot ' s curse Blasts the new - born infant ' s tear , And blights with plagues the marriage - hearse .
The gods of the earth and sea Sought through nature to find this tree , But their search was all in vain : There grows one in the human Brain .
My mother groaned , my father wept : Into the dangerous world I leapt , Helpless , naked , piping loud , Like a fiend hid in a cloud .
A POISON TREE
Are such thing done on Albion ' s shore ?
Children of the future age , Reading this indignant page , Know that in a former time Love , sweet love , was thought a crime .
How can the bird that is born for joy Sit in a cage and sing ?
How shall the summer arise in joy , Or the summer fruits appear ?
The sexes sprang from shame and pride , Blown in the morn , in evening died ; But mercy changed death into sleep ; The sexes rose to work and weep .
THE VOICE OF THE ANCIENT BARD
come hither And see the opening morn , Image of Truth new - born .
Folly is an endless maze ; Tangled roots perplex her ways ; How many have fallen there !
A DIVINE IMAGE
THE BOOK of THEL
The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks , All but the youngest : she in paleness sought the secret air .
Why fade these children of the spring ?
And gentle sleep the sleep of death , and gently hear the voice Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time .
Thel answerd , O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley .
Queen of the vales the Lily answered , ask the tender cloud , And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky .
And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air .
II .
I fear that I am not like thee : For I walk through the vales of Har , and smell the sweetest flowers : But I feed not the little flowers : I hear the warbling birds , But I feed not the warbling birds , they fly and seek their food : But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away And all shall say , without a use this shining women liv ' d , Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms .
The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf , And the bright Cloud saild on , to find his partner in the vale .
The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice & rais ' d her pitying head : She bowd over the weeping infant , and her life exhald In milky fondness , then on Thel she fix ' d her humble eyes
Why a Tongue impress ' d with honey from every wind ?
The Virgin started from her seat , & with a shriek , Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har
Pretty soon she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the keyhole .
" Poke your head through !"
THE CLOUD
And as the day passed , and the Cloud became larger , this wish to do something for the people of earth was ever greater in her heart .
And she began to sink softly down toward the earth .
But at last she stood quite still , and spoke boldly and proudly .
" Yes , I will help you ," cried the Cloud once more .
" Not I ," said the Duck .
" Not I ," said the Duck .
When it was time for the Gingerbread Boy to be done she opened the oven door and pulled out the pan .
And they couldn ' t catch him .
The little Gingerbread Boy laughed and said ,--
" I have run away from a little old woman ,
" Oho !
he said ,--
as fast as you can !
" A horse ,
run !
" And I can run away from you , I can !"
run !
Pretty soon he saw a fox coming across a field .
The fox began to run faster , and the little Gingerbread Boy ran faster , and as he ran he chuckled ,--
" A cow ,
The little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his back .
little Gingerbread Boy , my shoulder is sinking ; jump on my nose , and I can hold you out of water ."
The minute the fox reached the bank he threw back his head , and gave a snap !
Once there was a great big jungle ; and in the jungle there was a great big Lion ; and the Lion was king of the jungle .
When he had roared a few times all the little people of the jungle were so frightened that they came out of their holes and hiding - places and ran , this way and that , to get away .
He did this so often that at last there was not a single thing left alive in the jungle besides the Lion , except two little Jackals ,-- a little father Jackal and a little mother Jackal .
But at last a day came when the Lion was nearer still and the little mother Jackal was frightened almost to death .
Then what did those cunning little Jackals do but take hold of hands and run up towards the Lion , as if they had meant to come all the time .
" You miserable little wretches , come here and be eaten , at once !
The father Jackal bowed very low .
" There ' s no other lion in this jungle , and you know it !"
His face is much more terrible , and his roar far , far more dreadful .
At that the Lion stood up and roared so that the jungle shook .
The Lion above couldn ' t stand that .
It was only the reflection in the water !
" The Lion is dead !
" The Lion is dead !
THE COUNTRY MOUSE AND THE CITY MOUSE
The little Country Mouse was glad to do this , and after a while he went to the city to visit his friend .
whispered the City Mouse .
The little Country Mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away , but the little City Mouse said , " That is nothing ; she will soon go away and then we can go back ."
" What is that ?"
and ran as fast as he could to the hole .
" That is a trap !"
roll me around !"
And his mother would put out her hand from the big bed and push the little bed back and forth till she was tired .
more !"
The Moon laughed at the sight ; but when Little Jack Rollaround saw the Moon , he called out , " Open the door , old Moon !
The Moon could not open the door , but he shone in through the keyhole , in a broad band .
The good Moon went along and made a light , and they came to the forest .
" Roll !
But all the animals were asleep , and nobody at all looked at Little Jack Rollaround except an old White Owl ; and all she said was , " Who are you ?"
The kind Moon made a path up to the sky , and up sailed the little bed into the midst of the sky .
" Out of the way , there !
He went rolling criss - cross , up and down , all over the sky , knocking into the planets and stumbling into the clouds , till he did not know where he was .
" You are the biggest thing on the land , Brother Elephant ," said the Whale , " and I am the biggest thing in the sea ; if we join together we can rule all the animals in the world , and have our way about everything ."
Then he went along the beach till he came to the Whale .
The Whale was so pleased with the compliment that he said , " Yes ," at once .
asked the Elephant .
" Certainly ," said the Elephant grandly , " certainly ."
" Then ," said little Brother Rabbit , " I will tie one end of this long rope to your trunk , and the other to my cow , and as soon as I have tied her tightly I will beat my big drum .
There he sat down and beat the big drum .
" Who is pulling me ?"
And they began to pull again .
And little Brother Rabbit sat in the bushes and laughed , and laughed , and laughed .
There was once upon a time a Spanish Hen , who hatched out some nice little chickens .
The Hen - mother did not know what in the world to do with the queer little Half - Chick .
It would not mind , and it would go wherever it wanted to ; it walked with a funny little hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , and got along pretty fast .
" I cannot be bothered with you ; I am off to Madrid , to see the King !"
A bit farther on , the Half - Chick came to a Fire , which was smothered in damp sticks and in great distress .
And he went off , hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , leaving the Wind to smother .
Hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , the little Half - Chick skipped past the sentry at the gate , and hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , he crossed the court .
" I was needing a chicken !"
" Water , don ' t drown me !
And the Wind blew him straight up to the top of the church steeple , and stuck him there , fast !
THE BLACKBERRY - BUSH
It keeps nodding , nodding to me behind the fence ; what does it say , mamma ?"
" It says ," she answered , "' I see a happy little boy in the warm , fire - lighted room .
Then the snow will sink down and wrap me close .
Then the snow will melt again and icy rain will clothe me , and the bitter wind will rattle my bare twigs up and down .
And outside I peep over the snow and see a stream of ruddy light from a crack in the window - shutter , and I nod out here alone in the dark , thinking how beautiful it is .
Ah !
More and more I push forth my leaves , till out I burst in a gay green dress , and nod in joy and pride .
The little boy comes running to look at me , and cries , " Oh , mamma !
"' Ah !
* * * * *
His mother took him up in her arms , and they went out to supper and left the blackberry - bush nodding up and down in the wind ; and there it is nodding yet .
THE FAIRIES
Down along the rocky shore Some make their home -- They live on crispy pancakes Of yellow tide - foam ; Some in the reeds Of the black mountain - lake , With frogs for their watch - dogs , All night awake .
They stole little Bridget For seven years long ; When she came down again Her friends were all gone .
They took her lightly back , Between the night and morrow ; They thought that she was fast asleep , But she was dead with sorrow .
By the craggy hillside , Through the mosses bare , They have planted thorn - trees , For pleasure here and there .
Wee folk , good folk , Trooping all together ; Green jacket , red cap , And white owl ' s feather !
" It is my acorn ," said the Field Mouse ; " I found it ."
The little Field Mouse looked all about the room as fast as he could , but he could not see any acorn .
" You shall be my servant ; you shall make my bed and sweep my room and cook my broth ."
So the little brown Mouse was the little Red Man ' s servant , and every day he made the little Red Man ' s bed and swept the little Red Man ' s room and cooked the little Red Man ' s broth .
At last , one day he was in such a hurry that he turned the key before the door was quite latched , which , of course , didn ' t lock it at all .
He opened every little drawer and looked in , but it wasn ' t in any of the drawers ; he peeped on every shelf , but it wasn ' t on a shelf ; he hunted in every closet , but it wasn ' t in there .
I expect he set it down hard , for all at once , with a little snap , it opened !-- exactly like a little box .
And the little Red Man never knew what had become of it , because he didn ' t know where the little Field Mouse lived .
So the old Fox hid behind the wood - pile , and as soon as she bent down to get a stick , into the house he slipped , and scurried behind the door .
In a minute the little Red Hen came quickly in , and shut the door and locked it .
And as he spun , and spun , and spun , faster , and faster , and faster , the poor little Red Hen got so dizzy watching him that she couldn ' t hold on to the perch .
She dropped off , and the old Fox picked her up and put her in his bag , slung the bag over his shoulder , and started for home , where the kettle was boiling .
The old Fox went on carrying the stone and never knew the difference .
My , but it bumped him well !
Splash !
There was once ' t upon a time A little small Rid Hin , Off in the good ould country Where yees ha ' nivir bin .
There lived out o ' er the hill , In a great din o ' rocks , A crafty , shly , and wicked Ould folly iv a Fox .
He laid awake and thaught What a foine thing ' twad be To fetch her home and bile her up For his ould marm and he .
And so he thaught and thaught , Until he grew so thin That there was nothin ' left of him But jist his bones and shkin .
" Begorra , now , I ' ll have yees Widout much throuble more "; An ' in he shlips quite unbeknownst , An ' hides be ' ind the door .
An ' thin , a minute afther , In comes the small Rid Hin , An ' shuts the door , and locks it , too , An ' thinks , " I ' m safely in ."
An ' thin she tarns around An ' looks be ' ind the door ; There shtands the Fox wid his big tail Shpread out upon the floor .
" Aha !"
An ' thin he whiruled around , An ' round an ' round an ' round , Fashter an ' fashter an ' fashter , Afther his tail on the ground .
An ' Fox he whipped her up , An ' pit her in his bag , An ' off he started all alone , Him and his little dag .
Thin she betho ' t hersel ', An ' tuk her schissors out , An ' shnipped a big hole in the bag , So she could look about .
The way to carry cake is to wrap it all up nice in some leaves and put it in your hat , and put your hat on your head , and come along home .
Pretty soon the butter began to melt .
Epaminondas , what you got in your hat ?"
" Yes , Mammy ," said Epaminondas .
Next day Epaminondas went to see his Auntie again , and when he came to go home she gave him a loaf of bread to carry to his Mammy ; a brown , fresh , crusty loaf of bread .
But you can guess .
So he ran toward the village crying out , with all his might ,--
Come and help !
Then one day a wolf did break into the fold and began killing the lambs .
Did you ever hear the old story about the foolish Frogs ?
" I will give you a king such as you deserve !"
He was indeed a king worthy of them !
Each believed himself to be the more powerful .
While they were arguing they saw a traveller walking along the country highway , wearing a great cloak .
" Agreed ," said the Sun .
The Wind could not get it off .
THE LITTLE JACKAL AND THE ALLIGATOR
Clever Mr Alligator !
I hope you ' ll find it very tender !"
I ' ve made a mistake ."
" Thank you , Mr Alligator !
After this the little Jackal kept away from the river , out of danger .
He didn ' t see the old Alligator , but he thought to himself , " I think I ' ll not take any chances ."
The old Alligator was hidden down in the mud at the bottom of the river , and when he heard what the little Jackal said , he thought , " Aha !
For two whole weeks the little Jackal kept away from the river .
Very cautiously , he went down to the river and looked all around .
" When I don ' t see any little crabs on the shore , or sticking up out of the water , I usually see them blowing bubbles from under the water ; the little bubbles go _puff , puff , puff_ , and then they go _pop , pop , pop_ , and they show me where the little juicy crabs are , so I can put my paw in and catch them .
So he blew , and he blew , a mighty blast , and the bubbles rose in a perfect whirlpool , fizzing and swirling .
The little Jackal didn ' t have to be told who was underneath those bubbles : he took one quick look , and off he ran .
The old Alligator was so furious that he crawled up on the bank and went after the little Jackal ; but , dear , dear , he couldn ' t catch the little Jackal ; he ran far too fast .
After a while the little Jackal came dancing into the garden , very happy and free from care ,-- _but_ looking all around .
" Bother the suspicious little Jackal !
By and by the little Jackal came dancing home , happy and free from care ,-- _but_ looking all around .
He said ,--
" Hullo , little Jackal !"
What shall I do ?"
The farmer was in the field to - day , and he said , ' The corn is ready to cut ; we must call in the neighbours to help .'
And then he told his son to go out to - night and ask all the neighbours to come and reap the corn to - morrow ."
The farmer came to - day and said , ' The corn is getting too ripe ; we cannot wait for our neighbours ; we must ask our relatives to help us .'
I will move you out to - night ."
They had a wonderful , wise father , who knew stories to tell , and who taught them their lessons in such a beautiful way that it was better than play ; they had a lovely , merry , kind mother , who was never too tired to help them work or watch them play ; and they had all the great green country to play in .
And there was a big barn .
She had a splendid brain in her little head ; it liked study , and it thought interesting thoughts all day long .
Every year she grew more unselfish , and every year she worked harder .
Everybody bought it , and much money came from it .
Never again did the dear mother have to do any hard work , and she had pretty things about her all the rest of her life .
It will help you , too , to think the same thoughts .
Poor , sweet Piccola !
And full of faith , when at last she woke , She stole to her shoe as the morning broke ; Such sounds of gladness filled all the air , Twas plain St Nicholas had been there !
" See what the good saint brought !"
In the mental search for buried treasure which ensued , I came upon one or two word - impressions of the experiences of the Little Fir Tree , and forthwith wove them into what I supposed to be something of a reproduction of the original .
The latter part of the story had wholly faded from my memory , so that I " made up " to suit the tastes of my audience .
I offer it plainly as a story which children have liked , and which grew out of my early memories of Andersen ' s _The Little Fir Tree_ .
" Oh no , no , no ; you are too little , you are too little !"
They came to cut the big trees down and carry them away .
But by and by , one cold winter ' s morning , men came with a sledge and horses , and after they had cut here and there they came to the circle of trees round the Little Fir Tree , and looked all about .
The Little Fir Tree was happy as a bird , because he knew they were about to cut him down .
Until , finally , two children came along , hand in hand , looking carefully at all the small trees .
When they saw the Little Fir Tree they cried out ,--
Then the two pretty ladies took hold of the table with the Little Fir Tree on it and pushed it , very smoothly and quickly , out of the doors , across a hall , and in at another door .
The Little Fir Tree had a sudden sight of a long room with many little white beds in it , of children propped up on pillows in the beds , and of other children in great wheeled chairs , and others hobbling about or sitting in little chairs .
Thousands of years ago , many years before David lived , there was a very wise and good man of his people who was a friend and adviser of the king of Egypt .
Very soon after this wicked order , a boy baby was born in a certain Israelitish family .
When his mother first looked at him her heart was nearly broken , for he was even more beautiful than most babies are ,-- so strong and fair and sweet .
But his sister stood far off , not seeming to watch , but really watching carefully to see what would happen to the baby .
As the king ' s daughter came near to the water , she saw the strange little basket lying in the flags , and she sent her maid to bring it to her .
At that moment the baby ' s sister came to the princess and said , " Shall I go and find thee a nurse from the Hebrew women , so that she may nurse the child for thee ?"
And by and by , she married one of the people who loved her , and had a house of her own to take care of .
and Elsa would have to say , " I don ' t know ."
The grey man touched each one of the ten little fingers , and as he touched them he said their names : " Little Thumb ; Forefinger ; Thimble - finger ; Ring - finger ; Little Finger ; Little Thumb ; Forefinger ; Thimble - finger ; Ring - finger ; Little Finger !"
Hop , hop !
But suddenly the little fingers began to stir .
No sooner had she touched the bread board than the little fairies began to work : they measured the flour , mixed the bread , kneaded the loaves , and set them to rise , quicker than you could wink ; and when the bread was done , it was as nice as you could wish .
Elsa flew about from one thing to another , and the ten fairies did the work , just right .
She has only one maid , but , to see the work done , you would think she had as many servants as she has fingers on her hands !"
He cut out the shoes , ready to stitch , and left them on the bench ; then he said his prayers and went to bed , trusting that he could finish the shoes on the next day and sell them .
Just as the clock struck twelve the door opened softly , and two tiny elves came dancing into the room , hopped on to the bench , and began to put the pieces together .
They were quite naked , but they had wee little scissors and hammers and thread .
But as the clock struck two , the little creatures whisked away out of the window , and left the room all as it was before .
" Who killed my children while you were taking care of them ?"
" I shall go to King Solomon ," said the Otter , " and you shall be punished ."
When the Woodpecker came , he said to him , " Was it you who sounded the war - gong ?"
said the king .
" Yes , your Majesty ," said the Great Lizard ; " but I had to ."
Then the King - crab was sent for .
Immediately the Crayfish was sent for .
A Brahmin is a very good and gentle kind of man who lives in India , and who treats all the beasts as if they were his brothers .
One day a Brahmin was walking along a country road when he came upon a Tiger , shut up in a strong iron cage .
The villagers had caught him and shut him up there for his wickedness .
It is not fair or just that you should eat me , when I set you free ."
The Bullock looked up , and answered in a deep , grumbling voice ,--
" Oh , Brother Eagle , Brother Eagle !
" Brother Alligator , oh , Brother Alligator !"
Men are a worthless lot .
At this the Tiger was going to eat the Brahmin at once .
Do you think ----"
What sort of cage was it ?"
" Why , a big , ordinary cage , an iron cage ," said the Brahmin .
Show me the cage ."
" Friend Brahmin , where were you ?"
" I stood here ," said the Tiger , leaping into the cage , " with my head over my shoulder , so ."
" Oh , I do beg your pardon ," said the little Jackal .
" Oh , does it , indeed ?"
But you know -- if you don ' t , you will when you are grown up -- that no matter how clever you are , sooner or later you surely meet some one who is more clever .
This is what happened .
The little Jackal was , as you know , exceedingly fond of shell - fish , especially of river crabs .
When they were safely over , the little Jackal jumped down and showed the Camel the sugar - cane field ; then he ran swiftly along the river bank , to hunt for crabs ; the Camel began to eat sugar - cane .
Of course , the villagers heard him at once .
A brave little company of pioneers from the Atlantic coast crossed the Mississippi River and journeyed across the plains of Central North America in big covered wagons with many horses , and finally succeeded in climbing to the top of the great Rockies and down again into a valley in the very midst of the mountains .
So the pioneers settled there and built themselves huts and cabins for the first winter .
Then a terrible thing happened .
One day , the men who were watering the crops saw a great number of crickets swarming over the ground at the edge of the gardens nearest the mountains .
More left their useless struggles and knelt beside their neighbours .
woe !"
See !
And when at last they finished , they had stripped the fields of the army of crickets ; and the people were saved .
People came from all over the world to see the crystal palace and the wonderful garden and the great forest ; but when they went home and wrote books about these things they always wrote , " But the Nightingale is the best of all ."
" Who is this Nightingale ?"
said the Emperor .
The Chamberlain went out and asked all the great lords and ladies and pages where the Nightingale could be found , but not one of them had ever heard of him .
The Chamberlain did not want to be trampled upon , so he ran out and asked everybody in the palace about the Nightingale .
said the lords and ladies , " that must be the Nightingale ; what a large voice for so small a creature !"
In the great hall there was a gold perch for the Nightingale , beside the Emperor ' s throne .
Then the little grey Nightingale filled her throat full , and sang .
That was a great success .
She was to have a golden perch near the Emperor ' s bed , and a little golden cage , and was to be allowed to go out twice every day .
Inside was an artificial bird , something like a Nightingale , only it was made of gold , and silver , and rubies , and emeralds , and diamonds .
When it was wound up it played a waltz tune , and as it played it moved its little tail up and down .
So the artificial nightingale was given the real Nightingale ' s little gold perch , and every night the Emperor wound her up , and she sang waltz tunes to him .
About a year after the artificial nightingale came , the Emperor was listening to her waltz tune , when there was a _snap_ and _whir - r - r_ inside the bird , and the music stopped .
Then he ran to his clock - maker , but he could not do much .
When it was sure that he could not live much longer , the people chose a new emperor and waited for the old one to die .
Suddenly , through the open window , there came a most lovely song .
Once more Death begged for a song , and this time the little Nightingale obtained the banner for her singing .
After the little Nightingale had flown away , the Emperor felt so well and strong that he dressed himself in his royal robes and took his gold sceptre in his hand .
Behind the cottage were apple trees , a plum tree , and two or three pear trees ; then came a stretch of rough grass , and then a stone wall , with a gate leading into the fields .
asked her mother .
" It is a garden where you have all the things that make nice salad ," said her mother , laughing , for Margery was fond of salads ; " you have lettuce , and endive , and mustard and cress , and parsley , and radishes , and beetroot , and young onions ."
MISS MARGERY BROWN , PRIMROSE COTTAGE , 21 NARCISSUS ROAD , COLCHESTER .
Early the next morning , a man came driving up to the cottage with two strong white horses ; in his wagon was a plough .
It was a great , three - cornered piece of sharp steel , with long handles coming up from it , so that a man could hold it in place .
[ Illustration ]
Margery wondered what in the world he meant ; it had not been cultivated , of course , but what had that do with the kind of plough ?
When he had ploughed , the man went back to his cart and unloaded another farm implement .
It was called a harrow , and it looked like the diagram on the next page .
[ Illustration ]
That would not have had to be done if the land had been ploughed in the autumn ; the grass would have rotted in the ground , and would have made food for the plants .
Now , Margery ' s father put the fertiliser on the top , and then raked it into the earth .
" May I help ?"
Her father took a handful of peas , and , stooping , walked slowly along the line , letting the seed trickle through his fingers .
Margery liked it , because now the garden began to look _like_ a garden .
Father Brown loved Margery and Margery ' s mother so much that he wanted their garden to be perfect , and that meant a great deal more work .
The wider path was marked with lines and raked .
All these lovely flowers used to grow in our grandmothers ' gardens , and if you don ' t know what they look like , I hope you can find out next summer .
They were so tiny that it did not seem possible that green lettuce leaves could come from them .
But they surely would .
The next morning after the garden was planted , Margery was up and out at six o ' clock .
Margery flew back to her mother , to say that the first seeds were up .
But about the third day , while Margery was stooping over the radishes , she saw something very , very small and green , peeping above ground , where the lettuce was planted .
They don ' t look alike when they are on the table !"
The next day and the next they grew , until the beet leaves were big enough to see .
every plant has just two tiny leaves on it , and shaped the same ; they are roundish , and grow out of the stem at the same place ."
" Then every plant looks like this at first ?"
said Margery , dimpling .
And that was all that happened , that day .
said the Tortoise .
We will each take hold of one end of a stout stick , and do you take the middle in your mouth ; then we will fly up in the air with you and carry you with us .
But remember not to talk !
When they were above the treetops , the Tortoise wanted to say , " How high we are !"
But she remembered , and held her peace .
There is no power on earth or in heaven which can put me down from my seat !"
He came to the door with his keys and called out , " Who is there ?"
" Who art thou , and what dost thou here ?"
he asked .
" I am the king , and you are an impostor !"
You shall wear the cap and bells , and make laughter for my court .
With shouts of laughter , the courtiers drove Robert of Sicily from the banquet hall ; the waiting - men , with laughter , too , pushed him into the soldiers ' hall ; and there the pages brought the jester ' s wretched ape , and put a fool ' s cap and bells on Robert ' s head .
Sicily was happy and all things went well under the king , who was not Robert .
The Pope received his brothers and their trains in the square before Saint Peter ' s .
he cried ; " I am your brother , Robert of Sicily !
On Easter night , as he crept to his bed of straw , he wept , not because he was so wretched , but because he had not been a better king when power was his .
At last all the festivities were over , and the King of Sicily went home to his own land again , with his people .
The sound of their singing came softly in at the palace windows .
" Thou knowest best ," he said , " I only know that I have sinned ."
Then Robert of Sicily was alone .
His royal robes were upon him once more ; he wore his crown and his royal ring .
Then the statue was unveiled .
" No ," said another , " the horse is really not so successful ; the turn of the neck , there , is awkward ."
Once more the artist summoned the prince and his courtiers , and once more the statue was unveiled .
Again the Elector exclaimed at its beauty , and then he turned to his courtiers , one after another , to see what they had to say .
" Perfect !"
" My courtiers are much pleased now ," said the prince to Herr Grupello ; " they think the statue much improved by the changes you have made ."
PRINCE CHERRY
" Alas , I cannot make him good ," said the fairy ; " he must do that for himself .
As she spoke , she placed a small gold ring on the prince ' s little finger .
The first time that he noticed that even a king could not always have his own way was on a day when he went hunting .
It happened that he got no game .
The little gold ring began to feel tight and uncomfortable .
When he reached the palace his pet dog ran to meet him .
" Go away !"
" Am I not king of the whole land ?
He treated his people carelessly and his servants cruelly , and everything he wanted he felt that he must have .
He told one of his friends , a wicked man who flattered him for his own purposes , about the thing , and asked his advice .
" May you not do as you will ?
said the prince .
said the courtier .
As he stood , her voice came from the air , saying , sadly , " Learn to conquer your pride by being in submission to your own subjects ."
In the water he saw his own terrible image ; he had the head of a lion , with bull ' s horns , the feet of a wolf , and a tail like a serpent .
And as he gazed in horror , the fairy ' s voice whispered , " Your soul has become more ugly than your shape is ; you yourself have deformed it ."
" I will take the crown to keep in trust ," he said .
" He was a bad king ; we do not want him back ," said the people .
When the beast heard this , it touched him so much that he stopped tearing at his chains , and became gentle .
He let his keepers lead him away to the royal menagerie without hurting them .
He was often half starved , although so much petted .
One day he had carried his crust of bread to a retired spot in the palace woods , where he loved to be , when he saw a poor old woman hunting for roots , and seeming almost starved .
The thought made him so sorry and ashamed that he repented bitterly the evil he had done .
He seized it and was just going to devour it , when the old woman to whom he had given his crust snatched it away and took him in her arms .
said Zelia .
In a trice , they were transported to the prince ' s palace , where King Suliman greeted them with tears of joy .
THE GOLD IN THE ORCHARD
The children all over the city loved her ; the business men were proud of her ; the poor people all came to her for advice .
Then , by and by , one day , Margaret died .
And just think , dears , that splendid , wise will was signed with a cross instead of a name , for Margaret had never learned to read or write !
So they made a statue of her , just as she used to look , sitting in her own office door , or driving in her own little cart .
You know , dears , in the old countries there are many fine stories about things which happened so very long ago that nobody knows exactly how much of them is true .
Then the song would swell out louder , and every warrior would remember only the glory he had helped win for the king ; and each man would rise at the great table , his cup in his hand , and shout " Long live the King !"
And now a music stole forth as soft as dreams , and as sweet as joy : it was the magic Music of Sleep .
He brought his spade and shovel , and he made a hole , and he asked the old white horse to go down into it so that he could see if it would fit him .
The tailor went forward next day , and the fox met him .
" Would you make a place for me where I can hide ?"
The tailor went forward the next day , and he had not walked very far when he met a lion ; and the lion greeted him .
The tailor said he would not loose him until he came back himself .
The workpeople then went home , and the tailor went in hiding behind the big stone .
The tailor threw down the stone , and it fell on him and killed him .
The other two went home then and left all of the court that was remaining without throwing it down , since their companion was dead .
Then the tailor said that he would kill the other giant for him , and welcome ; that there should be no delay at all about that .
He went on until it was all poured into the skin , and the giant thought he had drunk it .
" Now you do that ," said he .
He went to the king then , and desired him to send him out his wife and his money , saying that he would throw down the court again if he did not do so immediately .
There sprang from the sons of Odin a race of men who became mighty kings of the earth , and one of these , named Frode , ruled over the lands that are called Denmark .
' We grind for Frode Wealth and gold Abundant riches He shall behold .'"
And as he watched them from the shadow by the door , the maidens stayed their grinding for a while to rest .
Presently , as the great stones moved round and round , Frode , who still stood by , heard one chant in a low , sing - song voice ,--
So they ground and ground ; and in the middle of the night , being weary , they asked the sea - king if he had not got salt enough .
And that is how the sea became salt .
THE CASTLE OF FORTUNE
he asked .
" I am the Fairy of Fortune ," the beautiful lady said , " and that is my castle .
" Then good - bye ," said his friend , " I am off ."
The lazy man lay down in the soft grass , and looked rather wistfully at the far - away towers .
" If only I had a good horse !"
Just at that moment he felt something warm nosing about at his shoulder , and heard a little whinny .
said the lazy man .
And in an instant he had leaped on the horse , and headed him for the castle of fortune .
laughed the lazy man , as he passed his friend .
He dismounted and sat down in the cool moss , with his back against a tree .
That _was_ a sleep !
No horse was to be found .
The only living thing near was an old , bony , grey donkey .
There he lay groaning for many minutes , for it was not a soft place , I can assure you .
How he wished he were in a soft , warm bed , with his aching bones comfortable in blankets !
To get to those beds he was even willing to bestir his poor limbs , so he sat up and felt about him for the donkey .
The animal was easier to sit on than the donkey , and the saddle seemed remarkably high behind ; it was good to lean against .
A ray from them fell on the lazy man ' s beast , and he saw what he was riding : it was a gigantic snail !
A cold shudder ran over the lazy man ' s body , and he would have got off his horrid animal then and there , but just then the clock struck once more .
The man grew frantic when he heard it .
" Every day , for forty days , he has come forth , so , and challenged us to send a man against him , in single combat ; and since no one dares to go out against him alone , the armies cannot fight ."
As he spoke , the giant stood still , on the hillside opposite the host of Israel , and shouted his challenge , scornfully .
Choose you a man , and let him come down to me .
David heard them talking among themselves , whispering and murmuring .
But Saul looked at David , and said , " Thou art not able to go against this Philistine , to fight with him , for thou art but a youth , and he has been a man of war from his youth ."
And when the Philistine looked about and saw David , he disdained him , for David was but a boy , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
Then , when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
David had many fierce battles to fight for King Saul against the enemies of Israel , and he won them all .
Often , after David had made a song , his chief musician would sing with him , as the people gathered to worship God .
It is a beautiful song ; I wish we knew the music that David made for it , but we only know his words .
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures ; he leadeth me beside the still waters .
Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me .
He is the man you seek ; his soul has grown to the selfsame stature as your own ; his treasure on the celestial shore is neither less than yours nor more ."
Almost he hoped he should not find the man , and could believe that he had dreamed the angel vision .
And when he had stopped and the crowd had left , the hermit went and drew the man aside to a place where they could rest ; for he wanted more than anything else on earth to know what the man ' s soul was like , because what it was , his was .
asked the hermit , painfully .
The clown ' s head sank in his hands .
" Yes , holy father ," he said , " I have been something else .
Was this how he looked to the Heavenly Father -- like a thief , a cruel mountain robber ?
" Tell me that one !"
pleaded the hermit .
Father , by terrible ways that I knew , hidden from the others , I took her safe to the convent gate .
I could not go back to the old bad life , and I had never learned an honest way to earn my bread .
my son ," cried the hermit , and now his tears were tears of joy .
Father , you mock me !"
When the hermit came to the door of the little farm , the two women who lived there were overjoyed to see him , for everyone loved and honoured his name .
He longed greatly to know what the souls of the two women were like , and from their looks he could see only that they were gentle and honest .
Presently he asked them about their lives .
" If my soul is as these ," he said , " I am blessed indeed ."
The little boy had grown quick to read these signs of distress , and he thought , " Christmas will be here soon , and dear mother is thinking of what a sad time it will be ."
Presently , however , a happy fancy came to him .
But he spoke gruffly enough to the postman , " This must be a foolish boy ; a small one , I have no doubt ."
" Nay , give me no thanks , worthy dame ," said the visitor .
From where He lay the Christ Child could see the great dark evening world and the darker forms of the trees keeping watch , like faithful guardians , beside the open door of the stable ; and to its delight the Fir Tree saw the face of the Babe illumined with a heavenly smile as He looked upon the twinkling lights .
THE DIAMOND AND THE DEWDROP
" Quite _too_ absurd , I declare !"
he exclaimed loftily .
Your very presence is distasteful to me .
the Beetle ventured to interpose , though with a very timid air .
However , it is some small consolation to remember that ' Imitation is the sincerest flattery .'
he piped , with a great sob of disappointment .
The world will never get over your loss ," cruelly sneered the Diamond .
_He could now lay down his life that the life of another might be saved ! _
" May _I_ help you , please ?"
" Oh , my precious , precious friend , if you will , you can save my life !"
And the Dewdrop slid from the blade of grass , tumbled into the parched beak , and was eagerly swallowed .
pondered the Beetle as he continued his homeward way .
" I ' ve been taught a lesson that I shall not easily forget .
and grinned .
" Must be that Chatterer got out of bed the wrong way this morning ," thought he .
When he came in sight of the little pool , who should he see but another fisherman there , who had already caught a fine fat trout .
He was just climbing up the bank with the fat trout in his mouth .
Buster Bear tiptoed up very softly until he was right behind Little Joe Otter .
I wouldn ' t mind if I had it myself ."
" Come and get it ."
Perhaps he didn ' t tell it quite exactly as it was , but you know he was very badly frightened at the time .
He took that fat trout away from me and ate it just as if it belonged to him !
" Let ' s go see what he is doing ," said Billy Mink .
Then we ' ll see how many fish he will get !
III
It had seemed like a great joke to Buster Bear , and he had chuckled over it all the time he was eating the fat trout .
Presently he came to another little pool .
Then he sat down close to the edge of it and didn ' t move .
" It ' s of no use to try to fish here .
I would just waste my time .
So he went on to the next little pool .
" It ' s very curious ," muttered Buster , " very curious indeed .
It ' s lucky I caught what I did .
Otter !
It was great fun .
It didn ' t take Buster long to catch all the fish he could eat .
And Billy Mink , who had been watching , ate the fat trout .
growled Little Joe .
As long as he doesn ' t , he doesn ' t belong to any one .
And really Little Joe has a great deal of courage .
Chug - a - rum !
But he did and was as grave and solemn as you please as he advised Little Joe always to make friends with any one who was bigger and stronger and smarter than he .
By and by he grinned .
Instead he carefully laid it on an old log where Buster Bear would be sure to see it if he should come along that way .
He had turned his head for just a minute , and when he looked back again , the trout was nowhere to be seen .
You see , he is just as fond of fishing as is Little Joe Otter or Billy Mink or Buster Bear .
Such a thing never had happened before .
" I never had such bad luck in all my life before .
What ' s this ?"
There , on the bank beside the little pool , were the heads of three trout .
" It wasn ' t cut off with a knife ; it was bitten off !"
Besides , he didn ' t remember ever having known Billy to leave heads around that way .
Billy sometimes catches more fish than he can eat , but then he usually hides them .
VIII
That ' s a funny thing for hair to do -- rise up all of a sudden -- isn ' t it ?
Anyway , that is what he said when he told about it afterward .
All the way home through the Green Forest , Farmer Brown ' s boy kept looking behind him , and he didn ' t draw a long breath until he reached the edge of the Green Forest .
" Hi !"
It must be that for once he has been smarter than Buster Bear ."
" Don ' t be too sure of that !"
" Boaster !
Boaster !"
" I ' m not through with you either , Peter Rabbit !"
" You ' ll find it out one of these fine days !"
Then he told how early that very morning he and Buster Bear had been fishing together in the Laughing Brook , and how Farmer Brown ' s boy had been fishing there too , and hadn ' t caught a single trout because they had all been caught or frightened before he got there .
" I ' ll believe it when I see it for myself !"
And so it was that Buster Bear became a hero right away to most of them .
Another was Reddy Fox .
Whenever they met one another , all they could talk about was the smartness and the greatness of Buster Bear .
cried Little Joe Otter .
" We ' ll do it right away ."
" Certainly , certainly .
XI
It ' s a fact .
Blacky likes excitement .
In the first place he felt very important , and you know Blacky dearly loves to feel important .
They had all come at his invitation to listen to a plan for seeing for themselves if it were really true that Farmer Brown ' s boy was afraid of Buster Bear .
On another lily - pad sat Spotty the Turtle .
On the other side of the Smiling Pool were Reddy Fox , Digger the Badger , and Bobby Coon .
Farmer Brown ' s boy has a lot of curiosity , and he will be sure to come over to see what it is all about .
Then we will lead him to where Buster Bear is .
And it promised to be so exciting that everybody promised to be there , that is , everybody but Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle , who didn ' t care to go so far away from the Smiling Pool .
Ever since it was light enough to see at all , Blacky the Crow had been sitting in the top of the tallest tree on the edge of the Green Forest nearest to Farmer Brown ' s house , and never for an instant had he taken his eyes from Farmer Brown ' s back door .
Why , for Farmer Brown ' s boy to come out on his way to milk the cows .
Now all this time the other little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows had been hiding where they could see all that went on .
Ha , ha , ha !"
He just hung his head , which is something Blacky seldom does .
" Perhaps if we wait until he comes out again , he will come over here ," said Sammy Jay , who had joined Blacky .
So it was decided to wait .
Now there was some one else with a great deal of curiosity also .
He just _had_ to know what it was all about .
So at the same time Farmer Brown ' s boy started for the Green Forest , this other listener started towards the place where Blacky and Sammy were making such a racket .
Then they would find out for sure if what Little Joe Otter had said was true ,-- that Farmer Brown ' s boy really was afraid of Buster Bear .
Now all around , behind trees and stumps , and under thick branches , and even in tree tops , were other little people watching with round , wide - open eyes to see what would happen .
You see , Buster walked very softly .
And that is how it happened that no one saw him or heard him until just as Farmer Brown ' s boy stepped out from behind one side of a thick little hemlock - tree , Buster Bear stepped out from behind the other side of that same little tree , and there they were face to face !
You see , it was the most exciting moment ever was in the Green Forest .
Farmer Brown ' s boy had just stepped out from behind one side of a little hemlock - tree and Buster Bear had just stepped out from behind the opposite side of the little hemlock - tree and neither had known that the other was anywhere near .
Once he stumbled and fell , but he scrambled to his feet in a twinkling , and away he went without once turning his head to see if Buster Bear was after him .
What do you think they saw ?
Sammy Jay looked at Blacky the Crow , and Blacky looked at Chatterer , and Chatterer looked at Happy Jack , and Happy Jack looked at Peter Rabbit , and Peter looked at Unc ' Billy Possum , and Unc ' Billy looked at Bobby Coon , and Bobby looked at Johnny Chuck , and Johnny looked at Reddy Fox , and Reddy looked at Jimmy Skunk , and Jimmy looked at Billy Mink , and Billy looked at Little Joe Otter , and for a minute nobody could say a word .
If Brer Bear isn ' t scared , he must have remembered something impo ' tant and has gone to attend to it in a powerful hurry ."
He had run even faster than Farmer Brown ' s boy , and had hidden in the most lonely place he could find in the very deepest part of the Green Forest .
But when impudent little Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted the same thing from a place just out of reach in a big pine - tree , Buster could stand it no longer .
He ran to the very top of the tree , so frightened that his teeth chattered , and when he looked down and saw Buster ' s great mouth coming nearer and nearer , he nearly tumbled down with terror .
If only he had kept his tongue still instead of saying hateful things to Buster Bear !
Chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble , and there was no one to blame but himself .
" Oh !"
He did it now .
Of course , he hit the ground pretty hard , and for just a second he quite lost his breath .
BUSTER BEAR GOES BERRYING
It ' s a habit .
Any habit becomes bad , if it is carried too far .
" Let me see , let me see , what is there to tempt my appetite ?"
" I find my appetite isn ' t what it ought to be .
My , my , my , how good some berries would taste !
Now if I were back up there in the Great Woods I could have all I could eat .
If I wasn ' t afraid that some one would see me , I ' d go up there ."
Buster sighed .
He was hungry -- hungry for berries and nothing else .
" I know what I ' ll do !
I ' ll go up there at the very first peep of day to - morrow .
The first Jolly Little Sunbeams had only reached the Green Meadows and had not started to creep into the Green Forest , when he saw a big , dark form steal out of the Green Forest where it joins the Old Pasture .
asked Farmer Brown ' s boy of his mother .
It lies at the foot of the Big Mountain , and even extends a little way up on the Big Mountain .
There is room in it for many people to pick berries all day without even seeing each other , unless they roam about a great deal .
Farmer Brown ' s boy started to whistle , and then he stopped .
" If I whistle ," thought he , " everybody will know just where I am , and will keep out of sight , and I never can get acquainted with folks if they keep out of sight ."
His little eyes twinkled with enjoyment , and he didn ' t mind at all if now and then he got leaves , and some green berries in his mouth with the big ripe berries .
He just chomped them all up together and patted his stomach from sheer delight .
And he had a feeling that he was a great deal more likely to meet one of them in the Old Pasture than deep in the Green Forest .
You know how it is .
Buster gave a little sigh of pure happiness .
To steal is to take something which belongs to some one else .
So there is no doubt that when Buster took them , he stole them .
Of course he upset the pail , but he didn ' t mind a little thing like that .
He threw up his head to listen , and somehow , he never did know just how , the handle of the pail slipped back over his ears and caught there .
This was bad enough , but to make matters worse , just at that very minute he heard a shrill , angry voice shout , " Hi , there !
After that second yell he just stood still and stared .
Yes , Sir , Buster Bear ran away with the big tin pail of Farmer Brown ' s boy !
You see when it slipped off his head , the handle was still around his neck , and there he was running away with a pail hanging from his neck !
And that brings us back to the question , did Buster steal Farmer Brown ' s boy ' s pail ?
Sammy ' s cousin , Blacky the Crow , just happened to be flying along the edge of the Old Pasture , and the minute he heard Sammy ' s voice , he turned and flew over to see what it was all about .
But Buster is so big that it is not easy for him to find a hiding place .
" Thief , thief , thief !"
It seemed to Buster as if everybody who lives in the Green Forest , on the Green Meadows , or around the Smiling Brook , was sitting around his hiding place , laughing and making fun of him .
He was very terrible to see .
Then he jumped on the helpless pail .
I ought to have known enough to keep my head out of it ," he said slowly and thoughtfully .
screamed Sammy , and flew away .
It hadn ' t entered his head that it could be anybody who would eat those berries .
" If he is so afraid of me , I guess I needn ' t be afraid of him ," said he .
" I ' ve lost my berries , but it is worth it to find out that he is afraid of me .
He walked over to the place where the pail had been , and then he remembered that when Buster ran away he had carried the pail with him , hanging about his neck .
Chuckling happily over Buster Bear ' s great fright , Farmer Brown ' s boy tramped back to the spring where he had left two thick sandwiches on a flat stone when he started to save his pail of berries .
" I ' m glad they are big and thick .
This he exclaimed right out loud , for he had just come in sight of the flat stone where the sandwiches should have been , and they were not there .
But Farmer Brown ' s boy didn ' t know anything about Old Man Coyote .
Guess this Old Pasture is no place for me to - day .
CHAPTER I .
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ' and what is the use of a book ,' thought Alice ' without pictures or conversation ?'
( Dinah was the cat .)
Dinah my dear !
Do cats eat bats ?'
However , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !
How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; ' and even if my head would go through ,' thought poor Alice , ' it would be of very little use without my shoulders .
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , (' which certainly was not here before ,' said Alice ,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ' DRINK ME ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .
It was all very well to say ' Drink me ,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry .
' But it ' s no use now ,' thought poor Alice , ' to pretend to be two people !
Why , there ' s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person !'
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words ' EAT ME ' were beautifully marked in currants .
CHAPTER II .
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it .
How queer everything is to - day !
Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ?
And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them .
I shall never get to twenty at that rate !
However , the Multiplication Table doesn ' t signify : let ' s try Geography .
' I ' m sure those are not the right words ,' said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , ' I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh !
It ' ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying " Come up again , dear !"
she thought .
' I must be growing small again .'
said Alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ' and now for the garden !'
and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas !
the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , ' and things are worse than ever ,' thought the poor child , ' for I never was so small as this before , never !
( Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother ' s Latin Grammar , ' A mouse -- of a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse !')
cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal ' s feelings .
' We indeed !'
' Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs ?'
cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , ' I ' m afraid I ' ve offended it again !'
When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , Alice thought ), and it said in a low trembling voice , ' Let us get to the shore , and then I ' ll tell you my history , and you ' ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs .'
CHAPTER III .
Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria --"'
said the Mouse , frowning , but very politely : ' Did you speak ?'
-- I proceed .
it continued , turning to Alice as it spoke .
' I don ' t know the meaning of half those long words , and , what ' s more , I don ' t believe you do either !'
and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , ' But who has won ?'
At last the Dodo said , ' EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes .'
he went on , turning to Alice .
Then they all crowded round her once more , while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble , saying ' We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble '; and , when it had finished this short speech , they all cheered .
' Mine is a long and a sad tale !'
said Alice , always ready to make herself useful , and looking anxiously about her .
' I shall do nothing of the sort ,' said the Mouse , getting up and walking away .
but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently , and walked a little quicker .
' What a pity it wouldn ' t stay !'
' You ' re enough to try the patience of an oyster !'
said Alice aloud , addressing nobody in particular .
And she ' s such a capital one for catching mice you can ' t think !
Oh , my dear Dinah !
CHAPTER IV .
And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to , without trying to explain the mistake it had made .
She hastily put down the bottle , saying to herself ' That ' s quite enough -- I hope I shan ' t grow any more -- As it is , I can ' t get out at the door -- I do wish I hadn ' t drunk quite so much !'
Luckily for Alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .
When I used to read fairy - tales , I fancied that kind of thing never happened , and now here I am in the middle of one !
There ought to be a book written about me , that there ought !
Oh , I shouldn ' t like THAT !'
Alice heard it say to itself ' Then I ' ll go round and get in at the window .'
Next came an angry voice -- the Rabbit ' s --' Pat !
And then a voice she had never heard before , ' Sure then I ' m here !
' Digging for apples , indeed !'
' An arm , you goose !
' Well , it ' s got no business there , at any rate : go and take it away !'
There was a long silence after this , and Alice could only hear whispers now and then ; such as , ' Sure , I don ' t like it , yer honour , at all , at all !'
they ' ll do well enough ; don ' t be particular -- Here , Bill !
the master says you ' re to go down the chimney !'
then silence , and then another confusion of voices --' Hold up his head -- Brandy now -- Don ' t choke him -- How was it , old fellow ?
Tell us all about it !'
Last came a little feeble , squeaking voice , (' That ' s Bill ,' thought Alice ,) ' Well , I hardly know -- No more , thank ye ; I ' m better now -- but I ' m a deal too flustered to tell you -- all I know is , something comes at me like a Jack - in - the - box , and up I goes like a sky - rocket !'
After a minute or two , they began moving about again , and Alice heard the Rabbit say , ' A barrowful will do , to begin with .'
which produced another dead silence .
' Poor little thing !'
' And yet what a dear little puppy it was !'
Let me see -- how IS it to be managed ?
Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances .
There was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .
Alice replied , rather shyly , ' I -- I hardly know , sir , just at present -- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then .'
' It isn ' t ,' said the Caterpillar .
said the Caterpillar contemptuously .
' I ' m afraid I am , sir ,' said Alice ; ' I can ' t remember things as I used -- and I don ' t keep the same size for ten minutes together !'
' In my youth ,' Father William replied to his son , ' I feared it might injure the brain ; But , now that I ' m perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again .'
' You are old ,' said the youth , ' one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose -- What made you so awfully clever ?'
' I have answered three questions , and that is enough ,' Said his father ; ' don ' t give yourself airs !
' That is not said right ,' said the Caterpillar .
said the Caterpillar .
' It is a very good height indeed !'
' But I ' m not used to it !'
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice , and shook itself .
thought Alice to herself .
However , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand .
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but she felt that there was no time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit .
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot , that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit .
* * * * * *
repeated the Pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , ' I ' ve tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them !'
Why , I haven ' t had a wink of sleep these three weeks !'
' Well !
' I ' ve seen a good many little girls in my time , but never ONE with such a neck as that !
No , no !
This was such a new idea to Alice , that she was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding , ' You ' re looking for eggs , I know THAT well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether you ' re a little girl or a serpent ?'
' It matters a good deal to ME ,' said Alice hastily ; ' but I ' m not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I shouldn ' t want YOURS : I don ' t like them raw .'
' Come , there ' s half my plan done now !
However , I ' ve got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden -- how IS that to be done , I wonder ?'
As she said this , she came suddenly upon an open place , with a little house in it about four feet high .
' Whoever lives there ,' thought Alice , ' it ' ll never do to come upon them THIS size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits !'
Pig and Pepper
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet .'
' There ' s no sort of use in knocking ,' said the Footman , ' and that for two reasons .
' Please , then ,' said Alice , ' how am I to get in ?'
'-- or next day , maybe ,' the Footman continued in the same tone , exactly as if nothing had happened .
' How am I to get in ?'
' There ' s certainly too much pepper in that soup !'
There was certainly too much of it in the air .
' I didn ' t know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I didn ' t know that cats COULD grin .'
' I don ' t know of any that do ,' Alice said very politely , feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation .
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her ; and the baby was howling so much already , that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not .
wow !'
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song , she kept tossing the baby violently up and down , and the poor little thing howled so , that Alice could hardly hear the words :--
' I speak severely to my boy , I beat him when he sneezes ; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases !'
wow !
The cook threw a frying - pan after her as she went out , but it just missed her .
' Don ' t grunt ,' said Alice ; ' that ' s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself .'
The baby grunted again , and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it .
The poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted , it was impossible to say which ), and they went on for some while in silence .
And she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying to herself , ' if one only knew the right way to change them --' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off .
'-- so long as I get SOMEWHERE ,' Alice added as an explanation .
Visit either you like : they ' re both mad .'
' Oh , you can ' t help that ,' said the Cat : ' we ' re all mad here .
You grant that ?'
' Well , then ,' the Cat went on , ' you see , a dog growls when it ' s angry , and wags its tail when it ' s pleased .
said the Cat .
Alice waited a little , half expecting to see it again , but it did not appear , and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live .
' Well !
It ' s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life !'
' You might just as well say ,' added the Dormouse , who seemed to be talking in his sleep , ' that " I breathe when I sleep " is the same thing as " I sleep when I breathe "!'
' It IS the same thing with you ,' said the Hatter , and here the conversation dropped , and the party sat silent for a minute , while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing - desks , which wasn ' t much .
he said , turning to Alice : he had taken his watch out of his pocket , and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then , and holding it to his ear .
' Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well ,' the Hatter grumbled : ' you shouldn ' t have put it in with the bread - knife .'
' What a funny watch !'
muttered the Hatter .
' I don ' t quite understand you ,' she said , as politely as she could .
' Have you guessed the riddle yet ?'
' If you knew Time as well as I do ,' said the Hatter , ' you wouldn ' t talk about wasting IT .
the Hatter said , tossing his head contemptuously .
' Perhaps not ,' Alice cautiously replied : ' but I know I have to beat time when I learn music .'
Now , if you only kept on good terms with him , he ' d do almost anything you liked with the clock .
The Hatter shook his head mournfully .
Here the Dormouse shook itself , and began singing in its sleep ' Twinkle , twinkle , twinkle , twinkle --' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop .
Off with his head !"'
' How dreadfully savage !'
' But what happens when you come to the beginning again ?'
' I ' m afraid I don ' t know one ,' said Alice , rather alarmed at the proposal .
' Tell us a story !'
said the March Hare .
' They lived on treacle ,' said the Dormouse , after thinking a minute or two .
' So they were ,' said the Dormouse ; ' VERY ill .'
' I ' ve had nothing yet ,' Alice replied in an offended tone , ' so I can ' t take more .'
' Nobody asked YOUR opinion ,' said Alice .
' Why did they live at the bottom of a well ?'
' There ' s no such thing !'
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear : she got up in great disgust , and walked off ; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly , and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot .
' At any rate I ' ll never go THERE again !'
Just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it .
' That ' s very curious !'
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and THEN -- she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower - beds and the cool fountains .
said Five .
The Queen turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , screamed ' Off with her head !
' May it please your Majesty ,' said Two , in a very humble tone , going down on one knee as he spoke , ' we were trying --'
' I see !'
' You shan ' t be beheaded !'
' Are their heads off ?'
said Alice .
Alice waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded .
In another minute the whole head appeared , and then Alice put down her flamingo , and began an account of the game , feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her .
' Well , it must be removed ,' said the King very decidedly , and he called the Queen , who was passing at the moment , ' My dear !
And the executioner went off like an arrow .
The Cat ' s head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the Duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game .
' When I ' M a Duchess ,' she said to herself , ( not in a very hopeful tone though ), ' I won ' t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL .
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time , and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear .
' Everything ' s got a moral , if only you can find it .'
' Somebody said ,' Alice whispered , ' that it ' s done by everybody minding their own business !'
Shall I try the experiment ?'
exclaimed Alice , who had not attended to this last remark , ' it ' s a vegetable .
' Pray don ' t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that ,' said Alice .
But here , to Alice ' s great surprise , the Duchess ' s voice died away , even in the middle of her favourite word ' moral ,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble .
' A fine day , your Majesty !'
As they walked off together , Alice heard the King say in a low voice , to the company generally , ' You are all pardoned .'
said the Queen , ' and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle , and to hear his history .
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight : then it chuckled .
' Why , SHE ,' said the Gryphon .
Come on !'
She pitied him deeply .
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying , ' Thank you , sir , for your interesting story ,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing .
The master was an old Turtle -- we used to call him Tortoise --'
asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously .
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise .
' What !
it exclaimed .
' Well , there was Mystery ,' the Mock Turtle replied , counting off the subjects on his flappers , '-- Mystery , ancient and modern , with Seaography : then Drawling -- the Drawling - master was an old conger - eel , that used to come once a week : HE taught us Drawling , Stretching , and Fainting in Coils .'
And the Gryphon never learnt it .'
' That ' s the reason they ' re called lessons ,' the Gryphon remarked : ' because they lessen from day to day .'
He looked at Alice , and tried to speak , but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice .
' Same as if he had a bone in his throat ,' said the Gryphon : and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back .
' You may not have lived much under the sea --' (' I haven ' t ,' said Alice )--' and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster --' ( Alice began to say ' I once tasted --' but checked herself hastily , and said ' No , never ') '-- so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is !'
' Two lines !'
cried the Mock Turtle .
'-- you advance twice --'
' Each with a lobster as a partner !'
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
Will you , won ' t you , will you , won ' t you , will you join the dance ?
and gave a look askance -- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
So they had to fall a long way .
That ' s all .'
' I never thought about it ,' said Alice .
' Does the boots and shoes !'
Alice looked down at them , and considered a little before she gave her answer .
' Soles and eels , of course ,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently : ' any shrimp could have told you that .'
' Of course not ,' said the Mock Turtle : ' why , if a fish came to ME , and told me he was going a journey , I should say " With what porpoise ?"'
said Alice .
' I mean what I say ,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone .
He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice .
' Well , I never heard it before ,' said the Mock Turtle ; ' but it sounds uncommon nonsense .'
' Go on with the next verse .'
Alice did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all come wrong , and she went on in a trembling voice :--
' I passed by his garden , and marked , with one eye , How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie --'
' Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille ?'
' Oh , a song , please , if the Mock Turtle would be so kind ,' Alice replied , so eagerly that the Gryphon said , in a rather offended tone , ' Hm !
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup !
Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup !
' Chorus again !'
Alice panted as she ran ; but the Gryphon only answered ' Come on !'
' Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup !'
CHAPTER XI .
Alice began in a loud , indignant voice , but she stopped hastily , for the White Rabbit cried out , ' Silence in the court !'
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked .
This of course , Alice could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away .
' Herald , read the accusation !'
' Fifteenth ,' said the March Hare .
said the Dormouse , who was sitting next to her .
' I ' m a poor man , your Majesty ,' the Hatter began , in a trembling voice , '-- and I hadn ' t begun my tea -- not above a week or so -- and what with the bread - and - butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the tea --'
Go on !'
the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry .
' I deny it !'
' After that ,' continued the Hatter , ' I cut some more bread - and - butter --'
' You MUST remember ,' remarked the King , ' or I ' ll have you executed .'
They had a large canvas bag , which tied up at the mouth with strings : into this they slipped the guinea - pig , head first , and then sat upon it .)
' Come , that finished the guinea - pigs !'
' You may go ,' said the King , and the Hatter hurriedly left the court , without even waiting to put his shoes on .
'-- and just take his head off outside ,' the Queen added to one of the officers : but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door .
The next witness was the Duchess ' s cook .
' Shan ' t ,' said the cook .
' Call the next witness .'
Imagine her surprise , when the White Rabbit read out , at the top of his shrill little voice , the name ' Alice !'
' Nothing ,' said Alice .
' Nothing WHATEVER ?'
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates , when the White Rabbit interrupted : ' UNimportant , your Majesty means , of course ,' he said in a very respectful tone , but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke .
' I ' M not a mile high ,' said Alice .
' Then it ought to be Number One ,' said Alice .
asked another of the jurymen .
( The jury all looked puzzled .)
said Alice .
' Read them ,' said the King .
Don ' t let him know she liked them best , For this must ever be A secret , kept from all the rest , Between yourself and me .'
The jury all wrote down on their slates , ' SHE doesn ' t believe there ' s an atom of meaning in it ,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper .
( Which he certainly did NOT , being made entirely of cardboard .)
' But , it goes on " THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU ,"' said Alice .
Then again --" BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT --" you never had fits , my dear , I think ?'
' Never !'
' Then the words don ' t FIT you ,' said the King , looking round the court with a smile .
' Hold your tongue !'
But her sister sat still just as she left her , leaning her head on her hand , watching the setting sun , and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures , till she too began dreaming after a fashion , and this was her dream :--
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by -- the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool -- she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never - ending meal , and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution -- once more the pig - baby was sneezing on the Duchess ' s knee , while plates and dishes crashed around it -- once more the shriek of the Gryphon , the squeaking of the Lizard ' s slate - pencil , and the choking of the suppressed guinea - pigs , filled the air , mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle .
I .
Everything demonstrates it .
Now , through a sort of purple haze , could be seen comparatively near to them what seemed to be the upper part of a huge , dark orb or sphere , islanded in a sea of cloud .
The Professor ' s eyes were blazing like a maniac ' s .
" There seems ," said Michael , timidly , " to be something sticking up in the middle of it ."
It was as if they had cloven into ancient cliffs like so much butter .
But sensations awaited them which were much stranger than those of sinking through the solid earth .
Through the dense London atmosphere they could see below them the flaming London lights ; lights which lay beneath them in squares and oblongs of fire .
They had broken through a roof and come into a temple of twilight .
This globe is reasonable ; that cross is unreasonable .
It is a four - legged animal , with one leg longer than the others .
That silent thing up there is essentially a collision , a crash , a struggle in stone .
But surely the cross is the lower development and the sphere the higher .
" And what is that , pray ?"
" That is surely wrong .
And the fruit should be at the top of the tree , not at the bottom of it ."
He was standing smoking , for a moment , in the front of an interminable line of palings , when his eyes were opened .
Lucifer was looking at him with a bitten lip .
We leave you saying that nobody ought to join the Church against his will .
When we meet you again you are saying that no one has any will to join it with .
We leave you saying that there is no such place as Eden .
Lucifer leapt upon him with a cry like a wild beast ' s .
Let it save you ."
" Yes , yes .
said the monk .
He was a happy and healthy old gentleman and therefore he was quite careless about it .
To this spasm of sanity and clarity in Michael ' s mind succeeded a spasm of the elemental terror ; the terror of the animal in us which regards the whole universe as its enemy ; which , when it is victorious , has no pity , and so , when it is defeated has no imaginable hope .
But then again in that damnable darkness there began to grow a strange dawn as of grey and pale silver .
And of this ultimate resignation or certainty it is even less possible to write ; it is something stranger than hell itself ; it is perhaps the last of the secrets of God .
This mysterious mood lasted long enough to start him on his dreadful descent and to force him to continue it .
When he dropped into the upper gallery he still felt as far from the terrestrial globe as if he had only dropped from the sun to the moon .
Michael had no mind to wonder whether this solid astonished man , with the brown moustache and the nickel buttons , had also come on a flying ship .
He began to listen to what he said , and even to make some attempt at answering a question which appeared to have been put several times and was now put with some excess of emphasis .
Michael stepped through it , and the unaccountable man in buttons leapt after him and pinioned him where he stood .
He was still full of the cold splendour of space , and of what a French writer has brilliantly named the " vertigo of the infinite ," when another door opened , and with a shock indescribable he found himself on the familiar level , in a street full of faces , with the houses and even the lamp - posts above his head .
He felt suddenly happy and suddenly indescribably small .
The lit squares of the shop windows excited him as the young are excited by the lit stage of some promising pantomime .
The pane of glass was lying in splinters about the pavement .
" I ' d do it again ," said the young man , with a furious white face .
Did you see what it said ?
It was in vain that the editor of _The Atheist_ filled his front window with fierce and final demands as to what Noah in the Ark did with the neck of the giraffe .
It was in vain that he hung in conspicuous places the most thrilling scientific calculations about the width of the throat of a whale .
The cross at the top of St . Paul ' s and _The Atheist_ shop at the foot of it were alike remote from the world .
Year after year went by , and year after year the death of God in a shop in Ludgate became a less and less important occurrence .
His high , hawklike features and snaky black hair bore the mark of that unknown historic thing which is crudely called Celtic , but which is probably far older than the Celts , whoever they were .
He had been brought up in some loneliness and seclusion as a strict Roman Catholic , in the midst of that little wedge of Roman Catholics which is driven into the Western Highlands .
He did not understand that their one essential historical principle , the one law truly graven on their hearts , was the great and comforting statement that Queen Anne is dead .
This faith was as fundamental as his faith , that Our Lady was alive .
The sky seemed to fall down towards the hills ; the hills took hold upon the sky .
His great - grandfather had been cut down at Culloden , certain in his last instant that God would restore the King .
He was not in the least the pathetic Jacobite of whom we read , left behind by a final advance of all things .
In the long , dark afternoons of the Highland winter , he plotted and fumed in the dark .
He had one shock of sentiment , when he turned that wonderful corner of Fleet Street and saw St . Paul ' s sitting in the sky .
Even as it was , the document would not have shocked even the innocent Highlander , but for the troublesome and quite unforeseen fact that the innocent Highlander read it stolidly to the end ; a thing unknown among the most enthusiastic subscribers to the paper , and calculated in any case to create a new situation .
Then he did understand it .
The glass fell in ringing fragments on to the pavement , and Evan sprang over the barrier into the shop , brandishing his stick .
" Stand up and fight , you crapulous coward .
You dirty lunatic , stand up , will you ?
asked Turnbull , glaring .
A great light like dawn came into Mr . Turnbull ' s face .
There was an air of refined mystery about Evan MacIan , which did not exist in the irate little shopkeeper , an air of refined mystery which appealed to the policemen , for policemen , like most other English types , are at once snobs and poets .
The police were not used to hearing principles , even the principles of their own existence .
" Be quiet ," said the magistrate , angrily , " it is most undesirable that things of that sort should be spoken about -- a -- in public , and in an ordinary Court of Justice .
I call it irreverent .
The most religious people are not those who talk about it .
" Eh ," cried Vane , glaring through his eye - glass .
" You are not going the right way to work , Sir ," he said , with severity .
If you had simply expressed regret for what you had done , I should have been strongly inclined to dismiss the matter as an outbreak of temper .
" So did I ," said the Highlander .
exploded Vane .
" Oh , you want a nurse to look after you ," he said .
It contained exactly twelve sovereigns .
Cumberland Vane seemed half hypnotized with the silence and automatic movements of the stranger ; he made a movement with his head which might have been either " yes " or " no ".
It may be excused , however , as a mere preliminary to further proceedings , a sort of preface .
I have only that which the poor have equally with the rich ; which the lonely have equally with the man of many friends .
I could not live in that imbecile universe .
" With Mr . Turnbull ," said Vane .
" What has he to do with peace ?"
" You ' re ozone after that fellow .
You ' re perfectly right .
I should love to see him sending you challenges and to see you smiling .
As he was brooding , he suddenly became conscious of a small , stern figure , fronting him in silence .
Its eyes were grey and awful , and its beard red .
" Why , you moonstruck scarecrow of superstition , do you think your dirty saints are the only people who can die ?
Haven ' t you hung atheists , and burned them , and boiled them , and did they ever deny their faith ?
Do you think we don ' t want to fight ?
" I know ," said Turnbull scornfully .
Now , fight if you dare ."
I swear it by the God you have denied , by the Blessed Lady you have blasphemed ; I swear it by the seven swords in her heart .
The evening sky , a dome of solid gold , unflaked even by a single sunset cloud , steeped the meanest sights of London in a strange and mellow light .
It made a little greasy street of St . Martin ' s Lane look as if it were paved with gold .
It would easily have made him beautiful if he had been merely squalid ; if he had been a Jew of the Fagin type .
The tall Scotchman in grey took a step forward and spoke in a voice quite clear and bold , and yet somehow lifeless , like a man going through an ancient formality .
But if you will be so kind as to take us into your little garden and see far play , we shall feel how ----"
My father died for it under the swords of the Yeomanry .
" MacIan ," said Turnbull , falling almost into the familiar tone of a business partner , " MacIan , tie up this fellow and put a gag in his mouth .
" Well , let ' s hope so ," said the Highlander , glancing doubtfully at the squirming thing on the floor .
" Do you see the bobbies ?"
said Turnbull , laughing .
" What ' s that ?"
" Be quick !
He turned one thrust , turned another , turned another .
The voice of the screaming shopkeeper was loud enough to drown not only the noise of the swords but all other noises around it , but even through its rending din there seemed to be some other stir or scurry .
A second after he spoke MacIan heard a heavy voice on the other side of the wall , saying : " I suppose I ' d better get over and look for them .
" And get inside with the swords ."
MacIan leant his white and rather weary face back upon the cushions in order to speak up through the open door .
I have been looking at all the streets as we went past , I have been looking at all the shops as we went past , I have been looking at all the churches as we went past .
" Don ' t run into anything ," said Evan , immovably .
He kept chiefly to the great roads , so full of hansoms that a wilder pair than they might easily have passed in the press .
" Under those conditions ," continued Turnbull , his voice coming through the hole with a slight note of trepidation very unusual with him , " I have a suggestion to make , if that can be called a suggestion , which has probably occurred to you as readily as to me .
We are , in the oddest and most exact sense of the term , brothers -- in arms ."
IV .
The duellists had from their own point of view escaped or conquered the chief powers of the modern world .
But when the same man was brought before a magistrate and defied his enemy to mortal combat in the open court , then the columns would hardly hold the excruciating information , and the headlines were so large that there was hardly room for any of the text .
Questions were asked about it , and even answered , in the House of Commons .
He was always represented ( in defiance of fact ), with red whiskers , and a very red nose , and in full Highland costume .
And a song , consisting of an unimaginable number of verses , in which his name was rhymed with flat iron , the British Lion , sly ' un , dandelion , Spion ( With Kop in the next line ), was sung to crowded houses every night .
And after denouncing so justly average modern men for so many years as sophists and as slaves , he looked down from an empty slope in Hampstead and saw what gods they are .
And what was to be the end of it all ?
" And still we ask if God or man Can loosen thee Lazarus ; Bid thee rise up republican , And save thyself and all of us .
Turnbull shivered again in the sharp morning air .
" Oh !
Turnbull said bitterly , " In a book ," and the silence fell suddenly between them again .
And to add to the disorder finally , there were strewn on top of everything , the most disorderly of modern things , newspapers , and more newspapers , and yet again newspapers , the ministers of the modern anarchy .
Turnbull laughed .
" Well , what did you expect ?"
" I have read what they have to say .
" That is a point ," said Turnbull , grimly , " that we will discuss later .
That infernal city down there is awake ; and it is awake against us .
All those forests of chimneys are fingers pointing at us , as we stand here on the hillside .
But because two gentlemen , from private feelings of delicacy , do want to die , they will mobilize the army and navy to prevent them .
We shall be the conversational substitute when anyone recommends Home Rule , or complains of sky signs .
We must expect to be recognized as much as if we were Napoleon escaping from Elba .
We must often sleep under the stars as if we were in Africa .
" I am not at all surprised ," he said , " at the world being against us .
I have the biscuits and the tinned meat , and the milk .
We turn under that third bush and so down into the valley ."
" It ' s not in the body ," said MacIan , in his dull , strange way .
" We must fight now , Turnbull .
Quick , it will soon be gone .
Quick !"
Never mind what God meant .
For the dreadful thought is in my mind ."
" Well , because ," said Turnbull , patiently .
" Your Celtic mind really goes too fast for me ," he said ; " let me be permitted in my heavy Lowland way to understand this new development .
We must fight now or else ----"
" You said , just now ," continued Turnbull , presently , " that if we did not fight now , we might not want to fight at all .
" Oh , Nominalism ," he said , with a sort of sigh , " we had all that out in the twelfth century ."
" The Church is not a thing like the Athenaeum Club ," he cried .
Confound it all , don ' t you see that I am more sure of its existence than I am of my own existence ?
It may have been something deeper ... something strange .
And if I like you ... it is because you are good ."
" Well , shall we fight now ?"
When the combatants , with crossed swords , became suddenly conscious of a third party , they each made the same movement .
Some new and strange thing was rising higher and higher in their hearts like a high sea at night .
Was there , perhaps , some such fatalism in friendship as all lovers talk about in love ?
Now , you don ' t mind my saying this , do you ?"
But the stranger , probably taking their silence for a gathering shame , continued with a kind of gaiety :
We ' ve quite outgrown duelling , you know .
In fact , Tolstoy tells us that we shall soon outgrow war , which he says is simply a duel between nations .
Without enlarging further on the fixed form of his appeal to the Church of Rome , he laughed cordially at Turnbull ' s answer ; then his wandering blue eyes caught the sunlight on the swords , and he assumed a good - humoured gravity .
" I am sure that if I appealed to your higher natures ... your higher natures .
Now , let us put the matter very plainly , and without any romantic nonsense about honour or anything of that sort .
What is the good of words if they aren ' t important enough to quarrel over ?
I say that murder is a sin , and bloodshed is not , and that there is as much difference between those words as there is between the word ' yes ' and the word ' no '; or rather more difference , for ' yes ' and ' no ', at least , belong to the same category .
Murder is a spiritual incident .
" Ah , you ' re a casuist !"
Now Tolstoy has shown that force is no remedy ; so you see the position in which I am placed .
He gave to the word an indescribable sound of something hard and heavy , as if he were saying " boots ".
When you were a baby , I suppose you loved your mother .
And if you will stand here and talk about love for another ten minutes it is very probable that you will see a man die for it ."
" I must be alone and consider which is the higher point of view .
" An hour ago ," said the Highlander , in his heavy meditative voice , " I felt the devil weakening my heart and my oath against you , and I prayed that God would send an angel to my aid ."
If that man had not tried to stop us ... I might ... I might have stopped ."
You may grow fond of that mire of crawling , cowardly morals , and you may come to think a blow bad , because it hurts , and not because it humiliates .
The swords caught on each other with a dreadful clang and jar , full of the old energy and hate ; and at once plunged and replunged .
Suddenly , furious as they were , they were frozen for a moment motionless .
" What ?...
THE OTHER PHILOSOPHER
said Turnbull , with civility .
They are too fat .
They will look like your friend , Cardinal Manning ."
" They won ' t catch us unless ----"
repeated the Highlander .
Listen ."
" What shall we do ?
Follow me ."
It was almost as high and smooth as a wall , and on the top of it the black hedge stood out over them as an angle , almost like a thatched roof of the lane .
The crimson seas of the sunset seemed to him like a bursting out of some sacred blood , as if the heart of the world had broken .
Keeping himself free from the tangle of the hedge he strolled across a triangle of obscure kitchen garden , and approached a dismal shed or lodge a yard or two beyond it .
It was a weather - stained hut of grey wood , which with all its desolation retained a tag or two of trivial ornament , which suggested that the thing had once been a sort of summer - house , and the place probably a sort of garden .
In the sudden silence , the drumming of the distant horses grew louder and louder with inconceivable rapidity , and the cavalcade of police rushed by below them in the lane , almost with the roar and rattle of an express train .
Again the sound of the wooden stick reverberated on the wooden door .
It was rather as if the point of a stick were plunged again and again at the panels in an absurd attempt to make a hole in them .
But he also picked up a sword as he stepped to open it .
As the two touched , the point of the stick was dropped very abruptly , and the man with the stick stepped hurriedly back .
He wore a square pale - grey jacket suit , on which the grey butterfly tie was the only indisputable touch of affectation .
But within this feminine frame of hair his face was unexpectedly impudent , like a monkey ' s .
he said , in a sharp small voice .
repeated the man .
Then turning to the stranger he said firmly , " I am sorry , sir , but we have something to do that must be done .
This man and I are alone in the modern world in that we think that God is essentially important .
If you like , we are attempting a mutual martyrdom .
Scotland Yard has fortified every police station with our enemies ; we are driven therefore to the edge of a lonely lane , and indirectly to taking liberties with your summer - house in order to arrange our ..."
" Put me out of my intellectual misery .
Are you the two people who wanted to spit each other in the Police Court ?
" Come up to my place ," he said .
" Come up !
Come in !"
It ' s the only good thing in God ' s world !
I ' ve walked about these damned fields and longed to see somebody cut up and killed and the blood running .
The little man stared an instant and then said : " Yes ," and Turnbull broke into a guffaw .
There was something gross and even evil in that eyeless and alien god among the most innocent of the English flowers .
" Come in !
They imagined him to be occupied on some concerns in the interior of the house , and they waited for his emergence , stamping the garden in silence -- the garden of tall , fresh country flowers , in the midst of which the monstrous South Sea idol lifted itself as abruptly as the prow of a ship riding on a sea of red and white and gold .
Yet when Turnbull ' s tread broke a twig , he was on his feet in a flash .
Let us go on to the lawn behind ."
And he ducked rapidly round the statue to an open space of grass on the other side of it .
he !
" It is Force ."
Perhaps it was his will , for he loves blood ; and on that stone in front of him men have been butchered by hundreds in the fierce , feasting islands of the South .
In the stillness MacIan made a sudden movement , unmeaning apparently , and then remained rigid .
" Perhaps I express myself a little too lyrically ," he said with an amicable abruptness .
You have found your way , gentlemen , by a beautiful accident , to the house of the only man in England ( probably ) who will favour and encourage your most reasonable project .
But do not fancy that you will find one other person who will comprehend a strong man taking the sword in his hand and wiping out his enemy .
They let me say it at dinner and so on , and seemed to like it .
But in a public lecture ... so inconsistent .
Turnbull , with a questioning glance , handed him the weapon .
The little man turned to Turnbull with a gesture , demanding judgement or protection .
Fight , if you ' re so fond of all that filthy philosophy !
And he ran at Wimpey , with blazing eyes .
Wimpey staggered back a few paces like a man struggling with his own limbs .
Something broke inside him , and he found himself running away , tumbling over his own feet in terror , and crying out as he ran .
Chase him into the sea !
Then he went bounding after the runaway .
He fled frantically down a long lane with his two terrors on his trail till he came to a gap in the hedge and went across a steep meadow like the wind .
And Turnbull sat down on the grass and went off into reverberations of laughter .
THE VILLAGE OF GRASSLEY - IN - THE - HOLE
" I have not noticed ," answered MacIan .
" What are you going to do ?"
They kill wild animals in the wild woods , but they don ' t kill cats to the God of Victory .
" The taste of what ?"
asked MacIan .
" Come down to the village .
Grassley - in - the - Hole was a rude parallelogram of buildings , with two thoroughfares which might have been called two high streets if it had been possible to call them streets .
One of these ways was higher on the slope than the other , the whole parallelogram lying aslant , so to speak , on the side of the hill .
MacIan , your health !"
Dusk was already dropping , the rustics in the tavern were already lurching and lumbering out of it by twos and threes , crying clamorous good nights to a solitary old toper that remained , before MacIan and Turnbull had reached the really important part of their discussion .
MacIan wore an expression of sad bewilderment not uncommon with him .
She is a myth .
It is not merely that I do not believe that nature can guide us .
It is that I do not believe that nature exists ."
The first blade of grass began to tear up the earth and eat it ; it was interfering with nature , if there is any nature .
The supernatural does not exist ."
" One can ' t talk of this kind of thing under a ceiling at all .
He burst the door open on a blue abyss of evening and they stepped out into it : it was suddenly and strangely cool .
Yes , there is a real difference between the natural and the supernatural : if you flew up into that blue sky this instant , I should think that you were moved by God -- or the devil .
The supernatural was not natural , but it was perfectly reasonable .
I mean that some things are mechanical and some things divine .
But there is the great difficulty , Turnbull .
The great difficulty is that , according to my teaching , you are divine ."
" That is just the difficulty ," continued MacIan thoughtfully .
" Rubbish !"
" Oh ," said MacIan patiently , " then if a man ' s free will isn ' t supernatural , why do your materialists deny that it exists ?"
" So what I feel is this : Here is the great divine creation I was taught to believe in .
It was all one thing to me .
Did you not take in those things , too , along with your theology ?"
" Go on ," repeated Turnbull ; " what ' s the matter with you ?
" Oh , yes ," said Turnbull in a tired way , " I suppose you mean God ."
" No , I don ' t ," said MacIan , shaking his head .
The most mouldering gods in the British Museum are new facts beside him .
It is he who in the end shall judge us all ."
" Oh , you have long words and I have long words ; and I talk of every man being the image of God ; and you talk of every man being a citizen and enlightened enough to govern .
The singer ' s step was neither very rapid , nor , indeed , exceptionally secure ; so the song grew louder and louder and the two soon overtook him .
MacIan , who was vibrating with one of his silent , violent decisions , opened the question without delay .
The old man extended a quivering stick in the direction of a distant hill .
Pulled down it was , in the old squire ' s time , and ----"
I know ' un .
Let me try .
A vote , a right to speak is what you ----"
I don ' t want no votin ' nor priests .
" Has anybody got beyond it ?"
Turnbull looked at him curiously .
But your Ibsens and your Zolas and your Shaws and your Tolstoys have not even got so far ."
AN INTERLUDE OF ARGUMENT
They had walked all night and talked all night also , and if the subject had been capable of being exhausted they would have exhausted it .
Nothing is plainer from real history than that each of your heretics invented a complete cosmos of his own which the next heretic smashed entirely to pieces .
Who cares ?
It is like asking if this corn is as yellow as that hill is steep .
The second is the Catholic Church ."
When Italy is mad on art the Church seems too Puritanical ; when England is mad on Puritanism the Church seems too artistic .
When you quarrel with us now you class us with kingship and despotism ; but when you quarrelled with us first it was because we would not accept the divine despotism of Henry VIII .
It is such rubbish that I am not even angry at it .
The thing is so plain and historical that I hardly think you will ever deny it .
What will remain ?
If you dislike him it is not because you are a nice ordinary man , but because you are ( if you will excuse me ) a sophisticated prig of a Fleet Street editor .
" No ," answered Turnbull ; " I trust that I am sufficiently fair - minded to canvass and consider the idea ; but having considered it , I think Fleet Street is right , yes -- even if the Parthenon is wrong .
You will laugh if I suggest that we may have made in Fleet Street an atmosphere in which a man can be so passionate as Sir Lancelot and as pure as Sir Galahad .
" It has been very well put by one of the brightest of your young authors , who said : ' Unless you become as little children ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven .'
No ; you have tried to escape from this thing , and the very thing you point to as the goal of your escape is only the thing again .
Neither noticed that both had instinctively stood still before the sign of the fixed and standing sword .
Whenever we have tried to be reconciled to each other , something has stopped us again .
By the run of our luck we have never had time to be either friends or enemies .
An instant afterwards the sharp , weak cry was repeated .
MacIan , though much heavier , avoided such an overthrow only by having the quick and incalculable feet of the mountaineer ; but both of them may be said to have leapt off a low cliff when they leapt into the road .
Three of them were standing about the road , giving their opinions to the moon with vague but echoing violence .
She was clad in close - fitting dark costume , a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wings or waves on each side of her forehead ; and even at that distance it could be seen that her profile was of the aquiline and eager sort , like a young falcon hardly free of the nest .
The man in the middle of the road was shouting in a hoarse and groggy voice that the chauffeur had smashed their car on purpose ; that they must get to the Cri that evening , and that he would jolly well have to take them there .
By the time the two champions came up , things had grown more serious .
But the other dropped at the interruption , turned upon Turnbull and began a battering bout of fisticuffs .
That is , he was motionless , even lifeless , and yet staringly significant , like a picture .
The motor - car , when he was not looking at it , gave him a rude impression of a captured coach in the old days of highwaymen .
He saw her face and hair first , then that she had long suede gloves ; then that there was a fur cap at the back of her brown hair .
" I can drive the car ," said the young woman in the fur cap with stony practicability .
If you will tell us where you are going , we will see you safely there and say good night ."
All this time MacIan had been in a sort of monstrous delirium , like some fabulous hero snatched up into the moon .
But it was another life altogether , like a cosmos with a new dimension .
They passed the next mile and a half swiftly and smoothly ; yet among the many things which they passed in the course of it was a clump of eager policemen standing at a cross - road .
" You may be right ," he said at last ; " if you are , I must tell her ."
" Why should you -- no , I must tell her , of course ----"
" The fact is ," he resumed , desperately , " the fact is , we are being chased by the police ."
A sergeant came to the side and touched his peaked cap to the lady .
" Incurable disturbers of the peace ."
" Westgate Adult Reformatory ," he replied , briefly .
Save that they were driving southward and had certainly passed the longitude of London , they knew nothing of their direction ; but Turnbull , who had spent a year on the Hampshire coast in his youth , began to recognize the unmistakable but quite indescribable villages of the English south .
The gloomy heavens were ripped up and rolled away like a scroll , revealing splendours , as the car went roaring up the curve of a great hill ; and above them and black against the broadening light , there stood one of those crouching and fantastic trees that are first signals of the sea .
THE SWORDS REJOINED
Turnbull had some such feeling , for he spoke for the first time for many hours .
said MacIan .
Evan ' s thoughts , that had been piled up to the morning star , abruptly let him down with a crash into the very cellars of the emotional universe .
" But why ?"
The girl ' s great brown eyes were lit up with a flash that was at once final desperation and the loosening of some private and passionate reserve .
They want you to do work among the poor ; which means reading Ruskin and feeling self - righteous in the best room in a poor tenement .
Then , after a pause , as she stared with a rising colour at the glittering sea , she said : " It can ' t be described , and yet I am trying to describe it .
" You forget our business , madam ," said Evan , in a shaking voice ; " we have no concern but to kill each other ."
What you are doing is so mad that it may be quite true .
Evan stood rooted upon the road , literally like some heavy statue hewn there in the age of the Druids .
As he spoke , three solemn footmen came out of the lodge gate and assembled to assist the chauffeur to his room .
But no answer came ; a silence sank between the two .
The sunrise , which was broadening over sea and shore , was one of those rare and splendid ones in which there seems to be no mist or doubt , and nothing but a universal clarification more and more complete .
" The hand of Heaven is still pointing ," muttered the man of superstition to himself .
It began as a steep and somewhat greasy path , which then tumbled down twenty or thirty feet in the form of a fall of rough stone steps .
After that , there was a rather awkward drop on to a ledge of stone and then the journey was undertaken easily and even elegantly by the remains of an ornamental staircase , such as might have belonged to some long - disused watering - place .
" We are quite safe here ," said Turnbull , and , to the other ' s surprise , flung himself down , sitting on the brown beach .
Imaginative life had never so much crowded upon MacIan .
There was a space filled with the sound of the sea , and then MacIan spoke again in a voice pathetically reasonable : " You see , we both saved her -- and she told us both to fight -- and it would not be just that either should fail and fall alone , while the other ----"
And this is not fair fighting ."
asked the other , staring .
I ' ll not fight foul for all the girls and angels in the universe ."
Evan looked very doubtful and offered a somewhat wavering weapon ; but he was quickly brought back to his senses by his opponent ' s sword - point , which shot past him , shaving his shoulder by a hair .
Then he saw that it was a fisherman ' s boat , and , leaping upward , caught hold of the bow .
The boat pitched forward with its stern in the air for just as much time as was needed to see that there was nobody in it .
After a moment or two of desperate clambering , however , there were two people in it , Mr . Evan MacIan , panting and sweating , and Mr . James Turnbull , uncommonly close to being drowned .
Then , while taking no notice of the streams of salt water that were pouring from his hair , beard , coat , boots , and trousers , he carefully wiped the wet off his sword - blade to preserve it from the possibilities of rust .
But it was piercingly cold , and there was , from time to time , a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray , which seemed almost to freeze as it fell .
They had a dreary walk across wastes of grey shingle in the grey dawn before they began to come within hail of human fields or roads ; nor had they any notion of what fields or roads they would be .
MacIan thought vaguely of a weird ballad of his own country which describes the soul in Purgatory as walking on a plain full of sharp stones , and only saved by its own charities upon earth .
Turnbull gave one glance at the crucifix -- a glance at once sympathetic and bitter , in which was concentrated the whole of Swinburne ' s poem on the same occasion .
" There ' s an omen for you superstitious hill folk .
said Turnbull , and all the rhetorical part of him came to the top , his face growing as red as his hair .
" But France , which was taught by St . Bernard and led to war by Joan of Arc .
Here , at least , we shall not be chased and spied on by sickly parsons and greasy policemen , because we wish to put our lives on the game .
He did not , however , have to puzzle long .
Turnbull saw the stare of consternation in his enemy ' s face and swung round to share its cause .
" What the devil are you doing here ?"
Then leaving MacIan and the policemen equally and instantaneously nailed to the road , he ran a little way along it , leapt off on to a part of the beach , which he had found in his journey to be firmer , and went across it with a clatter of pebbles .
Two who had been slower with their bodies were quicker with their minds , and seeing Turnbull ' s trick , ran along the edge of the road after him .
They dropped over a high breakwater farther on upon the beach , turned sharply , and scrambled up a line of ribbed rocks , crowned with a thicket , crawled through it , scratching their hands and faces , and dropped into another road ; and there found that they could slacken their speed into a steady trot .
One or two whitewashed cottages and even a shop had appeared along the side of the road .
A SCANDAL IN THE VILLAGE
In the little hamlet of Haroc , in the Isle of St . Loup , there lived a man who -- though living under the English flag -- was absolutely untypical of the French tradition .
He had a genius ( if one can even use so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person ) a genius for saying the conventional thing on every conceivable subject ; or rather what we in England would call the conventional thing .
Convention implies cant or affectation , and he had not the faintest smell of either .
But then in England a man announcing these platitudes is generally a fool and a frightened fool , announcing them out of mere social servility .
He lived in a little villa which was furnished well with comfortable chairs and tables and highly uncomfortable classical pictures and medallions .
Madeleine Durand was physically a sleepy young woman , and might easily have been supposed to be morally a lazy one .
It is , however , certain that the work of her house was done somehow , and it is even more rapidly ascertainable that nobody else did it .
His name was Camille Bert , and he was a commercial traveller who had only been in the island an idle week before he began to hover in the tracks of Madeleine Durand .
It was perhaps this religious regularity which eventually drew Madeleine into recognition of him .
He had the dress of a showy gentleman and the manners of a decayed gentleman ; he seemed ( as with a sort of simplicity ) to be trying to be a dandy when he was too old even to know that he was old .
Even Durand was invisible instead of being merely reverentially remote ; and Madeleine set forth through the patch of black forest alone .
I think they were afraid of her .
There is no man in my dominions so vile as I .
But when I bear you away I shall be doing my first sacrilege , and also my first act of virtue ."
Yet though she had not screamed , someone astray in the woods seemed to have heard the struggle .
The glowing and transparent blue of twilight had long been covered by the opaque and slatelike blue of night , when he handed her into the lamp - lit interior of her home .
All the French or semi - French gentry of the district considered this a case in which a duel was natural and inevitable , and neither party had any difficulty in finding seconds , strangers as they were in the place .
As no particular purpose could be served by delay , it was arranged that the affair should fall out three days afterwards .
What was not so usual was that when they were a bow - shot from the church Madeleine turned round and walked back to him .
No one has ever hit me ; and if they had I should not feel as a man may .
But it wasn ' t that that I meant ."
" What did you mean ?"
It seemed to alter his whole body .
His dark black hair and beard looked utterly unnatural against the startling pallor of his face .
He advanced upon Madeleine with flaming eyes , and almost took her by the two shoulders .
I must burst up the show ; I must and will say everything .
Madeleine looked at him doubtfully for an instant , and then said with a sudden simplicity and cheerfulness : " Oh , but if you are really sorry it is all right .
" I hate your priest and I deny your God !"
I might have played it successfully on any other woman ; I have hit the one woman on whom it cannot be played .
" Then why did you refuse to eat it ?"
" Why , how silly of them ," cried out Madeleine , with quite a schoolgirl gaiety , " why , how silly of them to call _you_ a blasphemer !
Then you say you know there is nothing on the very altar you run away from .
You know ----"
The prompt reply of Count Gregory was to pull off his large yellow whiskers and scatter them on the breeze with an air of considerable relief .
Then he joined the flight of Turnbull , and even as he did so , with one wrench of his powerful hands rent and split the strange , thick stick that he carried .
Inside it was a naked old - fashioned rapier .
" We really are in a hurry , as you say ," said MacIan , summoning a sufficiently pleasant smile , " so if you will let us pass ----"
Evan pulled up abruptly and looked back at him .
" Left side of harbour -- called _Gibson Girl_ -- can ' t think why , old fellow , I never lent it you before ."
THE DESERT ISLAND
The presence of the god or fairy can only be deduced from the fact that they never definitely ran into anything , either a boat , a rock , a quicksand , or a man - of - war .
How much farther they stood out into the western sea it was impossible to conjecture .
But they felt certain , at least , that they were far enough into that awful gulf between us and America to make it unlikely that they would soon see land again .
" Perhaps it ' s Atlantis ."
There were Mr . Wilkinson ' s cigar - boxes and Mr . Wilkinson ' s dozen of champagne and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned salmon and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned tongue and Mr . Wilkinson ' s tinned sardines , and every sort of preserved thing that could be seen at the Army and Navy stores .
" Yes , and there is something else ," said MacIan , with slight hesitation .
" A good idea ," said Turnbull , " and now let us finish unpacking ."
As MacIan , a tall , almost ghostly figure , paced along the edge of sand that ran round the islet , the purple but cloudy poetry which was his native element was piled up at its thickest upon his soul .
The unique island and the endless sea emphasized the thing solely as an epic .
" Perhaps when the morning stars were made ," he said to himself , " God built this island up from the bottom of the world to be a tower and a theatre for the fight between yea and nay ."
Before he descended , however , he fixed the two swords upright , one at each end of the platform , as if they were human sentinels to guard it under the stars .
Then they came down and lunched plentifully in a nest of loose rocks .
He had not even troubled to throw a glance round the island or the horizon .
On three sides of this shelly and sandy islet the sea stretched blue and infinite without a speck of land or sail ; the same as Turnbull had first seen it , except that the tide being out it showed a few yards more of slanting sand under the roots of the rocks .
Whether they were firm sand or quicksand it was difficult to guess ; but there was at least no doubt that they lay on the edge of some larger land ; for colourless hills appeared faintly behind them and no sea could be seen beyond .
MacIan turned his head , and his face , already pale , grew a shade paler .
" MacIan ," said Turnbull , in his temperate way , " whatever our eternal interrupted tete - a - tetes have taught us or not taught us , at least we need not fear the charge of fear .
If it is essential to your emotions , I will cheerfully finish the fight here and now ; but I must confess that if you kill me here I shall die with my curiosity highly excited and unsatisfied upon a minor point of geography ."
" So long as you gratify my query ," said Turnbull , laughing and letting back his blade into the sheath , " I do not care for what reason you choose to stop ."
" Take care , Turnbull ," he cried out from a good distance as he ran , " I ' ve seen a native ."
But it was only when he came within three feet of MacIan ' s face , that that observer of mankind fully realized that Mr . James Turnbull was roaring with laughter .
" You are quit right ," sobbed that wholly demoralized journalist .
" Did you see the nigger ----"
" Well , the truth is ," said Turnbull , suddenly and startlingly , becoming quite grave and precise , " the truth is , the nigger is a Margate nigger , and we are now on the edge of the Isle of Thanet , a few miles from Margate ."
I have learnt everything I wanted to know from the partially black musician over there , who has taken a run in his war - paint to meet a friend in a quiet pub along the coast -- the noble savage has told me all about it .
The bottle containing our declaration , doctrines , and dying sentiments was washed up on Margate beach yesterday in the presence of one alderman , two bathing - machine men , three policemen , seven doctors , and a hundred and thirteen London clerks on a holiday , to all of whom , whether directly or indirectly , our composition gave enormous literary pleasure .
MacIan followed his eye along the sand - hills .
THE GARDEN OF PEACE
Then he said : " We are quit of them ."
" No more sleep , I ' m afraid ," said Evan , in a heavy , almost submissive , voice of apology .
said Turnbull , sitting up and rubbing his red eyebrows with his hand .
MacIan nodded .
Here , however , it was MacIan ' s turn to have the advantage ; for , though less light - limbed and feline , he was longer and stronger in the arms .
They could make nothing of the enclosure upon which they were partial trespassers , except that the green and crooked branches of a big apple - tree came crawling at them out of the mist , like the tentacles of some green cuttlefish .
Though the white vapour was still a veil , it was like the gauzy veil of a transformation scene in a pantomime ; for through it there glowed shapeless masses of colour , masses which might be clouds of sunrise or mosaics of gold and crimson , or ladies robed in ruby and emerald draperies .
MacIan , whose mind was always haunted with such seraphic or titanic parallels , made some such remark to his companion .
He was a slim yet satisfied figure , clad in a suit of pale - grey tweed , so subdued that the pattern was imperceptible -- a costume that was casual but not by any means careless .
" Can I do anything for you ?"
MacIan bowed .
" Yes , certainly ; the grounds inside the wall really belong to me , and the grounds outside the wall , too ."
The police won ' t allow it in the streets -- and then there ' s the County Council -- and in the fields even nothing ' s allowed but posters of pills .
But a man may understand ragging and yet be very far from understanding religious ragging .
Even MacIan , therefore ( whose tact was far from being his strong point ), felt the necessity for some compromise in the mode of approach .
" We are fighting about God ; there can be nothing so important as that ."
I take it that it ' s nobody ' s business but mine -- or God ' s , if there is one .
" In this garden !
" Why , God , of course !"
" How funny it is to think that you have tumbled over a garden wall and fallen exactly on the right person !
Then as he led the heavy , silk - hatted man back towards the group , he caught MacIan ' s ear in order to whisper : " This poor gentleman is mad ; he thinks he is Edward VII ."
Your own royal position and my much humbler one surely indicate us as the proper seconds .
I am God ; really , they could hardly have better supporters .
They both felt at the same moment all the breadth and blossoming beauty of that paradise , the coloured trees , the natural and restful nooks and also the great wall of stone -- more awful than the wall of China -- from which no flesh could flee .
He seemed to hear all round him the hateful whispers of that place , innumerable as leaves whispering in the wind , and each of them telling eagerly some evil that had not happened or some terrific secret which was not true .
" Teeth ?"
Why do rhinoceroses have horns ?
You make a million worlds and only one seems inhabited .
What do you mean by it ?"
" The other gentleman ," cried Turnbull , scornfully , " is a submissive and loyal and obedient gentleman .
The man in the silk hat blinked and bridled in affected surprise , like one who was in truth accustomed to be doubted .
" Why should I take it off ," retorted MacIan , with equal heat , " before a usurper ?"
Bad pictures and bad manners and pantheism and the Albert Memorial .
Before the end of this tirade the arrogance of the monarch had entirely given way ; he had fairly turned tail and was trundling away down the path .
The other two remained in the centre of the lawn -- Turnbull in convulsions of laughter , the lunatic in convulsions of disgust .
" Protoplasm is not worth going mad about ."
" Why are you always wanting to humble a man ?"
" There are a few men here who are mad on God and a few who are mad on the Bible .
But I bet there are many more who are simply mad on madness ."
" I bet I have !"
cried Evan , with unusual animation .
He says one is always progressing beyond the best .
He put his arm in mine and whispered in my ear , as if it were the apocalypse : ' Never trust a God that you can ' t improve on .'"
" Obviously one should not trust any God that one can improve on ."
" Oh , dear !"
Evan was still staring back curiously at the beaming and bearded creature behind him .
After a rather restless silence Turnbull plucked MacIan by the elbow and pulled him aside .
The doctor with the pointed beard was already slanting it forward at a more than usually acute angle , with the smile that expressed expectancy .
cried Turnbull , losing his manners for the first time .
You know nothing about us .
The doctor got languidly to his feet .
Evan fell back and fought for his speech .
Let it be granted , then -- MacIan is a mystic ; MacIan is a maniac .
The doctor had already gone across to the laden shelves , and after a few minutes ' short - sighted peering , had pulled down another parallelogram of dark - red wood .
This also he unlocked on the table , and with the same unerring egotistic eye on of the company saw the words , written in large letters : " Turnbull , James ."
asked Evan .
He was out in the garden on one such luminous and ghostly night , when the steady moonshine toned down all the colours of the garden until almost the strongest tints to be seen were the strong soft blue of the sky and the large lemon moon .
He was walking with his face turned up to it in that rather half - witted fashion which might have excused the error of his keepers ; and as he gazed he became aware of something little and lustrous flying close to the lustrous orb , like a bright chip knocked off the moon .
At first he thought it was a mere sparkle or refraction in his own eyesight ; he blinked and cleared his eyes .
The next moment the thing drove right across the moon , and from being silver upon blue , suddenly became black upon silver ; then although it passed the field of light in a flash its outline was unmistakable though eccentric .
But the unknown preserved an impenetrable silence for a long space and then only answered : " I must not say who I am until the end of the world ; but I may say what I am .
It was not artificial in him to bend slightly to this solemn apparition or to lower his voice when he said : " Do you bring me some message ?"
As the white - robed figure went upward in his white chariot , he said quite quietly to Evan : " There is an answer to all the folly talked about equality .
And now England will be beautiful after the same fashion .
It is Capet and Plantagenet and Pendragon .
said the old man ; " he has returned ."
And he wondered whether the little shop was still by the side of it and whether its window had been mended .
MacIan drew in his breath , as children do at anything they think utterly beautiful .
As they went sailing down Ludgate Hill , Evan saw that the state of the streets fully answered his companion ' s claim about the reintroduction of order .
Groups of labourers , quietly but picturesquely clad , were passing up and down in sufficiently large numbers ; but it required but a few mounted men to keep the streets in order .
And I am not sure ," he continued , turning his back on Evan and looking out of the prow of the ship into the darkness , " I am not sure that I agree with your little maxim about justice .
cried MacIan , rising to the top of his tremendous stature , " did you think I would have doubted only for that rap with a sword ?
But I saw on your mouth the twitch of your infernal sophistry ; I knew that something was wrong with you and your cathedrals .
he cried .
But even the cheerful inner life of a logician may be upset by a lunatic asylum , to say nothing of whiffs of memory from a lady in Jersey , and the little red - bearded man on this windy evening was in a dangerous frame of mind .
And so strong and pitiless was the wind that it whipped away fragments of red - flowering bushes or of copper beech , and drove them also across the garden , a drift of red leaves , like the leaves of autumn , as in parody of the red and driven rags of cloud .
There was a sense in earth and heaven as of everything breaking up , and all the revolutionist in Turnbull rejoiced that it was breaking up .
Also it kept its shape , which is unusual with clouds shaken off ; also its shape was of an odd sort .
Turnbull continued to stare at it , and in a little time occurred that crucial instant when a thing , however incredible , is accepted as a fact .
The copper cloud was tumbling down towards the earth , like some gigantic leaf from the copper beeches .
And as it came nearer it was evident , first , that it was not a cloud , and , second , that it was not itself of the colour of copper ; only , being burnished like a mirror , it had reflected the red - brown colours of the burning clouds .
As the thing whirled like a windswept leaf down towards the wall of the garden it was clear that it was some sort of air - ship made of metal , and slapping the air with big broad fins of steel .
The first was that his lean brown body was bare to the belt of his loose white trousers ; the other that through hygiene , affectation , or whatever other cause , he had a scarlet handkerchief tied tightly but somewhat aslant across his brow .
" What do you want with me ?"
They seemed rising into stronger and stronger sunlight , as if it were sunrise rather than sunset .
Below them the fallen lights were literally the fallen stars of servitude .
There is only one pleasure the angels can possibly have in flying , and that is , that they do not know whether they are on their head or their heels ."
" So MacIan converted you ?"
Turnbull sprang up as if spurning the steel car from under his feet .
" Converted me !"
I have known him for a month , and I have not retracted a single ----"
" I am an atheist ," he said , in a stifled voice .
And the other answered without turning round :
" The truth is that we never thought that you could have been caught ," he said ; " we counted on you as the one red - hot revolutionary left in the world .
What does all this mean , and what do you want with me here ?"
repeated Turnbull , even in his dazed state a little touchy about such a dogma ; " how do you know it will be the last ?"
" What do you mean ?"
" Still I do not see ," said Turnbull , stubbornly .
Many of the insurgents are simple people , and they naturally regard it as a happy omen ."
Turnbull wrinkled his forehead .
I think I should always have said that I don ' t like this .
" Rights !"
" How inconsistent !
It really comes to this : You approve of taking away life from those to whom it is a triumph and a pleasure .
But you will not take away life from those to whom it is a burden and a toil ."
Good lives for bad !
asked the unknown .
And I will be a martyr for my faith as much as St . Catherine , for I will jump out of this ship and risk waking up safe in bed ."
They followed him into his shiny wooden office where their damning record was kept .
The doctor did not reply , and MacIan said : " I expected this ."
The doctor answered , looking at his desk and playing with a key : " Well , in certain cases that give anxiety -- it is often better ----"
What do you mean ?
They take it in good temper , walk and talk in your garden like monks who have found a vocation , are civil even to you , you damned druggists ' hack !
The tall Highlander , bending over him , put one hand on his shoulder with fatherly interest .
He almost ran out of the room , and the two followed swiftly on his flying coat tails .
At the other end of it was a ponderous and polished desk with an incandescent lamp on it , the light of which was just sufficient to show a slender , well - bred figure in an ordinary medical black frock - coat , whose head , quite silvered with age , was bent over neat piles of notes .
Among other things they said that to that particular Head of the institution it was a waste of time to appeal , and they followed Dr . Quayle out of the room .
Only the fact that windows grew fewer , coming at longer intervals , and the fact that when the windows did come they seemed shadowed and let in less light , showed that they were winding into the core or belly of some enormous building .
" You go in here , sir ," said the leader of the officials , quite respectfully , " and you in here ."
His cell was of an oblong shape , but very long in comparison with its width .
Even the shape of his cell especially irritated him .
After the fifth day he was reckless , and poked his head into the corner .
But it does it with the permanent possibility that the men may some day be more afraid of their enemies than of their officers .
Long after he had returned to sanity and such hopeless cheerfulness as a man might have on a desert island , he disliked the regular squares of the pattern of wall and floor and the triangle that terminated his corridor .
He no more expected rescue from a medical certificate than rescue from the solar system .
In many of his Robinson Crusoe moods he thought kindly of MacIan as of some quarrelsome school - fellow who had long been dead .
Then he remembered the Beauchamp Tower , and tried to write his blazing scepticism on the wall , and discovered that it was all shiny tiles on which nothing could be either drawn or carved .
The old prisoners could make a pet of a mouse or a beetle strayed out of a hole .
But he had forgotten how close efficiency has to pack everything together and how easily , therefore , a pipe here or there may leak .
After a few indistinct sounds the voice came down with a strong Argyllshire accent :
Then you do not know what loneliness is ."
Have you got one in your cell ?"
Three weeks afterwards MacIan had managed to open up communications which made his meaning plain .
The very fact that they were isolated from all companions meant that they were free from all spies , and as there were no gaolers to be bribed , so there were none to be baffled .
Turnbull tumbled somehow into MacIan ' s apartment , and his first glance found out that the iron spike was indeed plucked from its socket , and left , moreover , another ragged hole into some hollow place behind .
That individual looked at it with a puzzled face .
he asked .
" But where can the door of it be ?"
God knows how they did it , for he was let in by neither door nor window , nor lowered through any opening above .
It was a third oblong cell exactly like the other two except that it was doorless , and except that on one of the walls was painted a large black A like the B and C outside their own doors .
The thing got up with the promptitude of an animal , and turning round offered the spectacle of two owlish eyes and a huge grey - and - white beard not unlike the plumage of an owl .
This extraordinary beard covered him literally to his feet ( not that that was very far ), and perhaps it was as well that it did , for portions of his remaining clothing seemed to fall off whenever he moved .
" You are quite sure ," he said , " I cannot help you ?"
" Curse those cruel beasts !"
said Evan , slowly .
" All the same ," said Evan , like one answering in an ordinary conversation , " he did ask you whether he could help you ."
A RIDDLE OF FACES
I have the best and fullest reason .
said Turnbull , stepping forward with a respectful resolution .
" I think it a plain question ," said Turnbull , " and one that deserves a plain answer .
Why did the Master lock us up in a couple of cupboards like jars of pickles for a mortal month , and why does he now let us walk free in the garden again ?"
What are those arrangements ?"
As he very truly said , the mistake was in supposing insanity to be merely an exception or an extreme .
MacIan , who had not spoken yet , made one stride forward and stood with shaking limbs and shining eyes .
began Evan , thickly .
" I mean to say the plain truth now that the danger is over ," said Hutton , calmly ; " most certainly you two were the only people he ever was afraid of ."
Turnbull followed him in silence as he strode away , but just before he vanished , turned and spoke again to the doctors .
" But what has got hold of people ?"
Turnbull swung round without a word , and he and his companion were lost in the lustrous leafage of the garden .
It was no one that he knew well , yet he was certain that it was someone at whom he had at sometime or other looked steadily .
It was neither the face of a friend nor of an enemy ; it aroused neither irritation nor tenderness , yet it was a face which had for some reason been of great importance in his life .
The magistrate must have been transferred to some other official duties -- to something connected with the inspection of asylums .
" MacIan is the name , sir ," said Turnbull , respectfully ; " I have him here with me ."
Has he got anything to do with this game ?"
repeated the magistrate , with a slight start .
" I don ' t quite understand you ."
I ' m here as a patient .
" There is only one man who has any influence in England now ," said Vane , and his high voice fell to a sudden and convincing quietude .
" I am sorry you did not tell me so at the time ."
There was one evening , or late afternoon , in particular , which Evan MacIan will remember in the last moments of death .
MacIan , I say , will remember this tender and transparent evening , partly because of its virgin gold and silver , and partly because he passed beneath it through the most horrible instant of his life .
He was shocked out of his idle mood of awe by seeing MacIan break from behind the bushes and run across the lawn with an action he had never seen in the man before , with all his experience of the eccentric humours of this Celt .
MacIan fell on the bench , shaking it so that it rattled , and gripped it with his knees like one in dreadful pain of body .
That particular run and tumble is typical only of a man who has been hit by some sudden and incurable evil , who is bitten by a viper or condemned to be hanged .
they are right , Turnbull .
MacIan lowered his voice .
They sat for some moments in the mellow silence of the evening garden , a silence that was stifling for the sceptic , but utterly empty and final for the man of faith .
MacIan , she is uncommonly like ----"
cried MacIan , with a leap of eagerness that was heart - breaking , " do you see her , too ?"
And the blaze came back into the centre of his eyes .
" Really ," said the young lady , and laughed .
" I am locked up in the madhouse ," said Evan , with a sort of stiff pride , " because I tried to keep my promise to you ."
" Quite so ," answered the inexplicable lady , nodding with a perfectly blazing smile , " and I am locked up because it was to me you promised ."
" Yes , I know ," said Evan in a low voice , looking down .
Then he looked up suddenly , and said : " By the way , what is your name ?"
" Well , the fact is ----" began Turnbull again , and then the phrase was frozen on his mouth , for round the corner came the goatlike face and gleaming eye - glasses of Dr . Quayle .
His account of how he lost it is quite incoherent ."
Turnbull stamped his foot on the gravel path , and called out : " Oh , I can ' t stand this .
It is so rare , in fact , that in one classification of these maladies it is entered under a heading by itself -- Perdinavititis , mental inflammation creating the impression that one has lost a ship .
Under the first laburnum - tree he stopped , however , and pulling out his pencil and notebook wrote down feverishly : " Singular development in the Elenthero - maniac , Turnbull .
Then he ran raging round the garden to find MacIan , just as a husband , even a bad husband , will run raging to find his wife if he is full of a furious query .
" Are you hurt , Turnbull ?"
" No , you good atheist ," he cried ; " no , you clean , courteous , reverent , pious old blasphemer .
" There are two states where one meets so many old friends ," said MacIan ; " one is a dream , the other is the end of the world ."
" It ' s hard to explain , anyhow .
All the people are crowding into one corner .
asked Turnbull .
When I saw his eyes and heard his old croaking accent , I knew that it would not really have been right to kill you .
" You must give me time ," said MacIan , quite patiently , " for I am trying to tell the whole truth .
All England has turned into a lunatic asylum in order to prove us lunatics .
Massacre is wicked even with a provocation , as in the Bartholomew .
If the world has some healthy balance other than God , let the world find it .
Turnbull remained silent , and MacIan said to him , looking once more at the earth : " It staggers , Turnbull .
There is at last one simple solution to the quarrel between the ball and the cross ----"
asked MacIan .
" I had a dream ," said MacIan , " in which I saw the cross erect and the ball invisible .
They beat the old world about like a bladder and thump it into a thousand shapeless shapes .
Turnbull seemed to frown and flinch for a moment .
" You will be inside the building in three minutes ," he said , with pulverizing precision , " or you will be fired on by the artillery at all the windows .
There is too much talking in this garden ; we intend to close it .
And he turned his back and walked obediently towards the building .
Turnbull seemed to canvass for a few minutes the notion of knocking the Master down , and then fell under the same almost fairy fatalism as his companion .
XX .
But when they entered the lamp - lit hall , and the high iron door was clashed to and locked behind them , yet a new amazement leapt into their eyes , and the stalwart Turnbull almost fell .
He stepped impulsively forward towards Madeleine , and then wavered with a kind of wild humility .
As he did so he caught sight of another square face behind Madeleine ' s , a face with long grey whiskers and an austere stare .
Then all these bewildered but partly amicable recognitions were cloven by a cruel voice which always made all human blood turn bitter .
" You refuse me my half - bottle of Medoc , the drink the most wholesome and the most customary .
Law rests upon the social contract .
It is a pretty little point of theory ."
I will explain it , ladies and gentlemen ; I will explain everything .
The Master went on smoothly : " It was in vain for us to urge that the incident was irrelevant ; that there were many such fanatics , many such executions .
Now within our own time there arose an unfortunate fuss which threatened ( as Mr . Turnbull would say ) to galvanize the corpse of Christianity into a fictitious life -- the alleged case of a Highland eccentric who wanted to fight for the Virgin ."
Not a soul moved save Turnbull , who lifted his head ; yet there was the sense of a silent explosion .
The Master looked round the room , just showing his perfect teeth with the perfection of artistic cruelty , exalted for a moment in the enormous simplicity of his success , and then walked across the hall and vanished through an inner door .
Another instant and the hall was full of the fog of it , and red sparks began to swarm like scarlet bees .
" The place is on fire !"
wailed the other .
But we , the lunatics , will wait to be burned alive if only we may see them go ."
" How do you know we shall go ?"
" You think the doctors will go ," said Hutton , savagely .
Even as they spoke the main doors were burst open in mere brutal panic , and all the officers and subordinates of the asylum rushed away across the garden pursued by the smoke .
So silly of me ; and now I ' ve forgotten him in one of those little cells where your fire is burning .
* * *
" Listen !"
" No , by Heaven !
Turnbull was staring at him as he cried .
Its smoke was no longer sent up to choke the stars , but was trailed and dragged across county after county like one dreadful banner of defeat .
So that earth and ocean could behold , where there had been a mere fiery mass , a thing divided like a V -- a cloven tongue of flame .
Down the centre of this trough , or chasm , a little path ran , cleared of all but ashes , and down this little path was walking a little old man singing as if he were alone in a wood in spring .
While the first light of the fire had shot east and west , painting the sides of ships with fire - light or striking red sparks out of windowed houses , it had not hitherto struck upward , for there was above it the ponderous and rococo cavern of its own monstrous coloured smoke .
Then someone screamed , and no one looked up any more .
They went with a crash into the thick of the fire .
screamed Beatrice , hiding her head .
The are lost !"
" No , they are not lost ," he said .

Dr Hood paced the length of his string of apartments , bounded -- as the boys ' geographies say -- on the east by the North Sea and on the west by the serried ranks of his sociological and criminologist library .
He was clad in an artist ' s velvet , but with none of an artist ' s negligence ; his hair was heavily shot with grey , but growing thick and healthy ; his face was lean , but sanguine and expectant .
It is a rich confusion of social self - congratulation and bodily disarray .
His hat tumbled to the carpet , his heavy umbrella slipped between his knees with a thud ; he reached after the one and ducked after the other , but with an unimpaired smile on his round face spoke simultaneously as follows :
" Oh , this is of the greatest importance ," broke in the little man called Brown .
Now , what can be more important than that ?"
It is now , I understand , a question of whether some friend of yours called Maggie is a suitable fiancee for some friend of hers called Todhunter .
I will take it on .
I will give the MacNab family my best advice , as good as I gave the French Republic and the King of England -- no , better : fourteen years better .
The little clergyman called Brown thanked him with unquestionable warmth , but still with a queer kind of simplicity .
" This young James Todhunter ," continued the cleric , " is a very decent man so far as I know ; but then nobody knows very much .
Todhunter dashed down his window with violence , and the man in the high hat melted into the sea - fog again .
It is not remarkable that such people , with the sea moaning behind them and the Church ( excuse me again ) droning in front of them , should put fantastic features into what are probably plain events .
He sees thousands of Mrs MacNabs , in thousands of houses , dropping their little drop of morbidity in the tea - cups of their friends ; he sees --"
" I heard it through the door .
Two wine glasses stood ready for wine on a side - table , but a third lay smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet .
And in the corner behind it , thrown like a sack of potatoes , but corded like a railway trunk , lay Mr James Todhunter , with a scarf across his mouth , and six or seven ropes knotted round his elbows and ankles .
Dr Orion Hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in the whole scene of voiceless violence .
" I say ` old ' with intention , though not with certainty " continued the expositor ; " my reason for it might seem a little far - fetched .
The hair of human beings falls out in very varying degrees , but almost always falls out slightly , and with the lens I should see the tiny hairs in a hat recently worn .
Nevertheless , he was probably vigorous , and he was almost certainly tall .
These cards and wine - cups are no part of his normal habit ; they have been produced for a particular companion .
" Look here ," cried the young woman , " if you don ' t let me pass to untie him I ' ll run outside and scream for the police ."
Now , surely it is obvious that there are the three chief marks of the kind of man who is blackmailed .
I did not do it because Mr Todhunter can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses ."
One could almost fancy they were sea - monsters like krakens or cuttlefish , writhing polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end of this tragedy , even as he , the villain and victim of it , the terrible man in the tall hat , had once crawled up from the sea .
ejaculated Brown suddenly , " I wonder if it could possibly be that !"
asked Hood , in some exasperation .
He laughed very much over the hat , still more uproariously over the broken glass , but the blood on the sword point sent him into mortal convulsions of amusement .
Then he turned to the fuming specialist .
" I have no notion what you are talking about ," said Dr Hood rather haughtily ; " my facts are all inevitable , though necessarily incomplete .
He is so extremely absent .
I suppose ," he added reflectively , " that there was never anybody so absent as Mr Glass ."
" It is Mr Todhunter ' s ," replied Father Brown .
" But it doesn ' t fit him ," cried Hood impatiently .
Or , if you insist on a shade of difference , a hat that is his ."
" But a hatter ," protested Hood , " can get money out of his stock of new hats .
" Do you mean inside Mr Todhunter ' s clothes ?"
" I do not mean inside Mr Todhunter ' s clothes ," said Father Brown .
" I mean inside Mr Todhunter ."
" Mr Todhunter ," explained Father Brown placidly , " is learning to be a professional conjurer , as well as juggler , ventriloquist , and expert in the rope trick .
The juggling explains the three glasses , which Todhunter was teaching himself to throw up and catch in rotation .
But , being only at the stage of practice , he smashed one glass against the ceiling .
And the juggling also explains the sword , which it was Mr Todhunter ' s professional pride and duty to swallow .
He merely kept his trade secret , because he had to keep his tricks secret , like any other conjurer .
But the mere fact of an idler in a top hat having once looked in at his back window , and been driven away by him with great indignation , was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance , and make us imagine his whole life overshadowed by the silk - hatted spectre of Mr Glass ."
" But What about the two voices ?"
" You are certainly a very ingenious person ," he said ; " it could not have been done better in a book .
Mr Brown broke into a rather childish giggle .
There was a second of stillness in the room , and then everyone with one accord burst out laughing .
Then , advancing into the middle of the room with a bow , he produced from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red , which announced that ZALADIN , the World ' s Greatest Conjurer , Contortionist , Ventriloquist and Human Kangaroo would be ready with an entirely new series of Tricks at the Empire Pavilion , Scarborough , on Monday next at eight o ' clock precisely .
The restaurant was glittering , but still comparatively empty .
Two priests were talking at a table in a corner , but Muscari ( an ardent Catholic ) took no more notice of them than of a couple of crows .
In fact it was a head he knew .
This youth had been a prodigy at college , and European fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen ; but when he appeared in the world he failed , first publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue , and then privately for years on end as an actor , a traveller , a commission agent or a journalist .
" Well , I ' ve seen you in many costumes in the green room ; but I never expected to see you dressed up as an Englishman ."
" This ," answered Ezza gravely , " is not the costume of an Englishman , but of the Italian of the future ."
In the sixteenth century we Tuscans made the morning : we had the newest steel , the newest carving , the newest chemistry .
" Well , to me Marconi , or D ' Annunzio , is the star of Italy " said the other .
He ' s not clever , he ' s got eyes like blue buttons ; he ' s not energetic , he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic .
" I ' m stupid enough for that ," said Ezza gloomily .
He was a massive elderly man with a boiled blue eye and faded grey - sandy moustaches ; but for his heavy stoop he might have been a colonel .
All eyes , as usual , were riveted , for the moment at least , upon Ethel Harrogate , whose golden Greek head and colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea , like a goddess ' s .
He was drinking the Classic ; which his fathers made .
Ezza studied her with a gaze equally intense and far more baffling .
In Ethel Harrogate conventionality crowned itself with a perfection and splendour of its own .
" They say ," she cried , with the awful relish of a schoolgirl , " that all that country isn ' t ruled by the King of Italy , but by the King of Thieves .
There may have been some old jailbird called a King in the time of our grandmothers ; but he belongs to history if not to fable .
Brigandage is utterly stamped out ."
" I am crossing it tomorrow ."
But the man spoke before his memories could collect themselves .
The odd thing I have to say will come far better from a stranger .
Mr Harrogate , I say one word and go : take care of your sister in her great sorrow ."
" One can only be kind when it comes ."
Between Ezza ' s cheery denial of the danger and Muscari ' s boisterous defiance of it , the financial family were firm in their original purpose ; and Muscari made his mountain journey coincide with theirs .
The fields were burnished in sun and wind with the colour of kingfisher and parrot and humming - bird , the hues of a hundred flowering flowers .
There are no lovelier meadows and woodlands than the English , no nobler crests or chasms than those of Snowdon and Glencoe .
There was nothing here of that chill and desolation that in Britain one associates with high and wild scenery .
" It is never your fault ," answered Muscari ; " it was not your fault that Troy fell ."
As they spoke they came under overwhelming cliffs that spread almost like wings above a corner of peculiar peril .
Muscari threw an arm round Ethel , who clung to him , and shouted aloud .
Beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from the head of Muscari , and beside it a sealed business letter which , after a glance at the address , he returned to the elder Harrogate .
Mortals climb up and they fall down ; but it is only gods and goddesses who can fall upwards ."
And indeed she rose out of the sea of colours so beautiful and happy a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shifted .
" Will you stand there talking nonsense about yourself with a woman to save and three strong men to help you ?
I am not the kind of criminal that ` reserves his defence ,' but the better kind that reserves his last bullet ."
" Thank God !"
The poison belongs to this robber - chief , of course .
The Reverend Father Brown and the celebrated Signor Muscari I shall release tomorrow at dawn and escort to my outposts .
Poets and priests , if you will pardon my simplicity of speech , never have any money .
The brigand captain took the large paper from the attendant brigand and , glancing over it , continued : " My other intentions are clearly set forth in this public document , which I will hand round in a moment ; and which after that will be posted on a tree by every village in the valley , and every cross - road in the hills .
As four of you left the room , you and Miss Harrogate went ahead , talking and laughing ; the banker and the courier came behind , speaking sparely and rather low .
What may be the third objection to the King of the Thieves ?"
Whatever is the meaning of this odd little nook of grass and flowers , it is not an entrenched position .
It is more like an accidental theatre or a natural green - room ; it is like the scene for some romantic comedy ; it is like ...."
The next moment he turned his olive , sneering face and made a movement with his hand .
cried Muscari , springing to his feet and waving his hat ; " the gendarmes are on them !
Fall on the rear of these ruffians .
And throwing his hat over the trees , he drew his cutlass once more and began to escalade the slope up to the road .
Frank Harrogate jumped up and ran across to help him , revolver in hand , but was astounded to hear himself imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father , who seemed to be in great agitation .
" I won ' t have it ," said the banker in a choking voice ; " I command you not to interfere ."
Montano also had his cutlass unsheathed , and Muscari , without further speech , sent a slash at his head which he was compelled to catch and parry .
" Everything about me is a sham ," responded the ex - courier in complete good humour .
I am only a bundle of masks , and you can ' t fight a duel with that ."
You will permit me the impertinent intimacy , but do you care about that girl ?
" I think so ," was the equally grave reply .
The time is short ."
" Why ?"
He will be a serious loss to his family ."
M . Armagnac , by way of a change , had two beards ; one sticking out from each corner of his emphatic chin .
They were both pupils of the great Dr Hirsch , scientist , publicist and moralist .
But his antimilitarism was of a peculiar and Gallic sort .
An eminent and very wealthy English Quaker , who had come to see him to arrange for the disarmament of the whole planet , was rather distressed by Armagnac ' s proposal that ( by way of beginning ) the soldiers should shoot their officers .
To their party throughout Europe , however , Paul Hirsch was a saint of science .
The door was opened to them by the doctor ' s old servant , Simon , who might very well have passed for a doctor himself , having a strict suit of black , spectacles , grey hair , and a confidential manner .
With all the gravity of a great physician handling a prescription , Simon handed a letter to M . Armagnac .
I cannot meet him myself .
There is going to be another Dreyfus case .
P . HIRSCH
Armagnac and Brun instantly stood up ; but they were too late .
God help me , that is why I am speaking !
Silent as he is when I beat on his bedroom door !
It is signed with his initials .
" I went to this man in straight and civil style .
If he had any explanation it could have been given in complete confidence .
Once more a few sentences were inaudible , but they could hear him say : " To my friends -- I myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual , and to these an evolved humanity will certainly confine itself .
My books are successful ; my theories are unrefuted ; but I suffer in politics from a prejudice almost physical in the French .
Well , I give my proofs : I will pay this barbaric bribe , and then go back to reason for the rest of my life ."
In the early evening a light dinner was spread at the back of the Cafe Charlemagne .
" That ' s just the odd thing ," replied Flambeau .
But it wasn ' t written by Hirsch .
After that we really can ' t support Dubosc if his revelation is a mare ' s nest ."
It says the grey envelope contains a long document written in red ink .
" What ?"
he asked , in an altered voice .
But if it was white , the whole business is black .
The Doctor has been dabbling in some of the old brimstone after all ."
" But I tell you he couldn ' t have written such a note !"
cried Flambeau .
" The only thing I can think of .... Well , I never understood that Dreyfus case .
I don ' t mean they behaved well ; I mean they behaved as if they were sure .
Suppose he even thought he was saving his country by misleading the foreigner .
Suppose this brought him into spy circles , and little loans were made to him , and little ties tied on to him .
I doubt the whole story , though it has been acted before my face .
There is something in this business quite different from the ordinary police mystery where one man is more or less lying and the other man more or less telling the truth .
It doesn ' t satisfy me ."
" I should call it thin ," said the priest promptly .
cried Flambeau , with an incredulity quite frightful -- " apologize ?"
Confound it !"
It ' s meant to work up glory for Hirsch ..."
" Will he be there still , do you think ?"
Once , when the Duke impatiently asked whether Hirsch was guilty of treason or not , he answered rather absently : " No ; only of ambition -- like Caesar ."
" Hullo !"
" He ' s only gone into one of these garden doors ," and as he spoke they heard one of the dull wooden doors close again with a click in front of them .
Then he threw up his long arms and swung himself aloft like a monkey and stood on the top of the wall , his enormous figure dark against the purple sky , like the dark tree - tops .
Valognes ' s eyes brightened , but his voice sank .
I thought I could recognize the back of a house as well as the back of a man ."
A red blind had been pulled down over the light , but pulled crookedly , so that it gaped on one side , and by risking his neck along a branch that looked as treacherous as a twig , Flambeau could just see Colonel Dubosc walking about in a brilliantly - lighted and luxurious bedroom .
" There are people in Paris who will cure them of such morbid fancies ," said Valognes vindictively .
" They are the opposite of each other ," said Father Brown , with a queer kind of smile .
" They contradict each other .
That investigator , peering into the lighted room , had just seen the Colonel , after a pace or two , proceed to take his coat off .
His brown complexion had gone , his big black moustache had gone ; he -- was clean - shaven and very pate .
Under the wall Father Brown was going on in heavy meditation , as if to himself .
" It is all just like what I was saying to Flambeau .
The other side of the passage contained two doors , one at each end .
Persons of that eminence often like to have such private exits and entrances , for meeting friends or avoiding them .
In the Arts especially he was omnipotent .
But you could not meet him for five minutes without realizing that you had really been ruled by him all your life .
His tall , slender figure had a slight stoop yet it looked the reverse of feeble .
His hair was silver - grey , but he did not look old ; it was worn longer than the common yet he did not look effeminate ; it was curly but it did not look curled .
His carefully pointed beard made him look more manly and militant than otherwise , as it does in those old admirals of Velazquez with whose dark portraits his house was hung .
The other man was not so tall , yet would have struck nobody as short , but merely as strong and handsome .
His hair also was curly , but fair and cropped close to a strong , massive head -- the sort of head you break a door with , as Chaucer said of the Miller ' s .
His face was somewhat square , his jaw was square , his shoulders were square , even his jacket was square .
In thousands of English homes he appeared enormous above England , like Nelson .
Nearly six - foot - six , and of more than theatrical thews and muscles , Isidore Bruno , in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden - brown garments of Oberon , looked like a barbaric god .
He leaned on a sort of hunting - spear , which across a theatre looked a slight , silvery wand , but which in the small and comparatively crowded room looked as plain as a pike - staff -- and as menacing .
The detachment of a professional celibate seemed to reveal to the others that they stood round the woman as a ring of amorous rivals ; just as a stranger coming in with frost on his coat will reveal that a room is like a furnace .
Cutler , the British officer , was pachydermatous to ideas , but punctilious about behaviour .
The priest did really admire Miss Rome as she achieved all these three objects in one selected action .
The first object of her diplomacy , the exit of the enraged Bruno , was at once achieved .
He had already handed his spear in a lordly style , like a sceptre , to the piteous Parkinson , and was about to assume one of the cushioned seats like a throne .
Yet a second or two after Seymour ' s brow darkened again .
" Who ' s that man in the passage ?"
he cried .
At this the other two men dropped their quarrel and darted after him , Cutler calling out : " What are you doing ?
The three men looked down , and in one of them at least the life died in that late light of afternoon .
Not yours -- but I think I know whose ."
They treated Cutler with a certain solemn attention , and pointed out that he had got a slight slash on the hand .
Cutler made no answer , but said sharply a moment after : " We must attend to the ... the death ..." and his voice escaped from articulation .
And he stood looking down at old Parkinson , who sat in a black huddle on the gorgeous chair .
" Will you understand my motives ," asked Father Brown quietly , " if I say you have done all you can to hurt ?"
They both started as if guiltily , and Cutler said sharply : " To hurt whom ?"
" Which drew blood ," replied the priest , nodding .
There was a silence ; and then Seymour said , with an emphasis quite alien to his daily accent : " But I saw a man in the passage ."
In idle curiosity as to the rapid movement of his friends , he had strolled out to the head of the passage himself and looked down it towards the prisoner ' s door .
Did he see anything in the passage ?
Then the barrister said in a lower voice , which seemed at once sympathetic and creepy : " Did you see it distinctly ?"
Sir Wilson Seymour , however moved , had his excellent brains in full working - order .
Tall as Bruno was to the eye , he seemed to swell taller and taller when an eyes had been torn away from him .
There was something about the thing that was not exactly a woman and yet was not quite a man ; somehow the curves were different .
But he could give little artistic assistance about the black figure that he and Seymour had seen .
" Great Scott , no !"
No feminine curves ?
Therefore he took Father Brown up sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried to explain anything ; and told him to answer yes or no , and tell the plain facts without any jesuitry .
" The shape ," he said , " was short and thick , but had two sharp , black projections curved upwards on each side of the head or top , rather like horns , and --"
" It was the devil come to eat Protestants ."
" It was a looking - glass on the other side ," explained Father Brown .
There was another vast and unnatural silence , and this time it was the judge who spoke .
" I think them equally valueless ," replied Brown .
" There ' s a disadvantage in a stick pointing straight ," answered the other .
It depends whether you get hold of the stick by the right end .
His theories were extremely complicated and were held with extreme simplicity .
" Ah !"
" Well , does that interest you ?"
I am keeping the bullet for Pilgrim ' s Pond -- O . R .'
A man must have used most fiendish treachery or most savage and amazing bodily daring to have stormed such a wall in spite of an armed man ."
" He isn ' t in any hole ," said the governor ; " he isn ' t up any tree ."
" Would you like to speak to him ?"
" I got hold of him with the crooked end of a walking - stick .
He appeared to be much exhausted ; but when he came to the thick black hedge he went through it as if it were made of spiders ' webs ; -- or rather ( for I heard the strong branches breaking and snapping like bayonets ) as if he himself were made of stone .
" You thought it was the runaway convict ," observed the priest simply , " because you had read in the newspaper cutting that morning that a convict had run away ."
As Usher stopped abruptly in his walk the priest added apologetically : " I ' ve been told a bullet is not half so useful without it ."
So it looked to me , till another little discovery woke up what I have of the detective in me .
As I stood peering at this misty pool , I fancied I saw the faint figure of a man moving from the house towards it , but it was all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact , and still less of the details .
A door had opened in the dark bulk of the left wing , and a figure appeared black against the illuminated interior -- a muffled figure bending forward , evidently peering out into the night .
A window was thrown up in one of the upper floors , but just round the corner of the house so that I could not see it ; and a voice of terrible distinctness was heard shouting across the dark garden to know where Lord Falconroy was , for he was missing from every room in the house .
You don ' t do justice to the climbing and aspiring power of our more remarkable citizens .
" I reckon you ' ll be shocked ," replied Greywood Usher , " as I know you don ' t cotton to the march of science in these matters .
I am given a good deal of discretion here , and perhaps take a little more than I ' m given ; and I thought it was an excellent opportunity to test that Psychometric Machine I told you about .
" I sat the man in the ill - fitting clothes in a comfortable chair , and simply wrote words on a blackboard ; and the machine simply recorded the variations of his pulse ; and I simply observed his manner .
Who else in this republic has any reason to jump at the name of a newly - arrived Englishman like Falconroy except the man who ' s shot him ?
" Why , what do you mean ?"
I tried the machine first just in order to test the thing in other ways afterwards and the machine , sir , is right ."
Moreover , under all the stains of his plunging through ploughed fields or bursting through dusty hedges , the man was comparatively clean .
His demeanour was , I am bound to confess , quite in accordance with theirs .
He asked me more than once if he could telephone for a lawyer who had helped him a long time ago in a trade dispute , and in every sense acted as you would expect an innocent man to act .
There was nothing against him in the world except that little finger on the dial that pointed to the change of his pulse .
By the time I came with him out of the private room into the vestibule where all sorts of other people were awaiting examination , I think he had already more or less made up his mind to clear things up by something like a confession .
If you must know all about me --'
she shouted .
But I ' m not quite so ignorant , you may be surprised to hear .
It is certain he had done murder more than once long before his last exploit with the warder .
I heard a rumour of his having reappeared somewhere in the opposite character this time , lending money instead of borrowing it ; but still to such poor widows as he might personally fascinate , but still with the same bad result for them .
Even , since then , four criminals and three warders have identified him and confirmed the story .
" Why , bless us all !"
You tell me this man you have here spent weeks and months wheedling needy women out of small sums of money ; that he used a drug at the best , and a poison at the worst ; that he turned up afterwards as the lowest kind of moneylender , and cheated most poor people in the same patient and pacific style .
If that is so , I will tell you what he didn ' t do .
He didn ' t write on the wall with his own hand , to say he had done it .
He didn ' t explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder .
He didn ' t write his own , initials in a man ' s blood .
" I have a suggestion to make ," he said , " but it seems a little confusing .
Mr Ireton Todd is a good host , and has tracked him here , without even waiting to take off his fancy - dress ."
But the other machine did ; the machine that worked it .
" But you can ' t be so mad as to say ," said Greywood Usher , very white , " that Lord Falconroy was Drugger Davis ."
It says he was in the States in youth ; but the whole story seems very strange .
I would not hang a dog on my own opinion about this .
Many of our most influential noblemen have not only risen recently , but --"
Now Safe in --"
But a yet more depressing feature in the grey facade is its telescopic length and changeless continuity .
His friend , Flambeau , a semi - official investigator , was sitting opposite him , making his last notes of a case he had cleared up in the neighbourhood .
Then his round eyes rolled to the large white lettering on the window above his head , and then strayed to the next table , at which sat only a navvy with beer and cheese , and a young girl with red hair and a glass of milk .
Flambeau looked up in surprise ; but the girl with the red hair also looked up , and with something that was stronger than astonishment .
At last she leaned over and said in a low , strong voice : " Why do you say that ?
Then his dubious eye roamed again to the white lettering on the glass front of the public - house .
The young woman ' s eyes followed his , and rested there also , but in pure puzzledom .
" What does it matter what it says ?"
He seemed to find much food for thought in this ; but his reply was very slow and hesitant .
" Well ?"
she repeated .
I held myself ready to help if he annoyed you ; that is all .
" But it ' s such a crooked nose ," remonstrated the red - haired girl .
The priest smiled in his turn .
" This man , I think , wears it because his real nose is so much nicer ."
" You are more of a mystery than all the others ," she said desperately , " but I feel there might be a heart in your mystery ."
" I will tell you everything ," said the red - haired girl doggedly , " except why I am telling you ; and that I don ' t know ."
Well , my name is Christabel Carstairs ; and my father was that Colonel Carstairs you ' ve probably heard of , who made the famous Carstairs Collection of Roman coins .
He was as handsome and as genuine and as valuable and as metallic and as out - of - date .
He quarrelled with one son , my brother Giles , and sent him to Australia on a small allowance .
I think a man as clever as you can guess the sort of thing that would begin to relieve the monotony for an unruly girl of seventeen placed in such a position .
As soon as I heard the heavy door close on him finally , I made a bolt for my shrimping - net and tam - o '- shanter and was just going to slip out , when I saw that my brother had left behind him one coin that lay gleaming on the long bench by the window .
" At the very instant I had a shock of fancy : that a man far away on the sand - hills was looking at me intently .
There was no earthly logical evidence that he was looking at me ; he might have been looking at a ship , or the sunset , or the sea - gulls , or at any of the people who still strayed here and there on the shore between us .
" I can ' t tell you the sense of monstrosity and miracle I had when he thus silently burst the barrier between land and water .
His complexion was neither sallow nor livid , but on the contrary rather clear and youthful ; yet this gave a pink - and - white wax look which somehow ( I don ' t know why ) rather increased the horror .
I think it seemed as if he could move his nose like a finger .
I saw him crawling out below , covered with sand .
Father Brown presented him to the lady in his own slight , persuasive style of speech , mentioning his knowledge and sympathy in such cases ; and almost without knowing , the girl was soon reiterating her story to two listeners .
Brown accepted it with some surprise and read on it : " Cab to Wagga Wagga , 379 , Mafeking Avenue , Putney ."
The girl was going on with her story .
" The man or monster I ' d sent away was standing quite still in the middle of the garden .
" For it was not a thumb , any more than it was a snail .
What I did next does matter : I gave him all the money I had , including a good deal in paper which , though it was mine , I dare say I had no right to touch .
He went off at last , with hateful , tactful regrets all in long words ; and I sat down , feeling ruined in every sense .
I was coming back from them this evening , when I saw the abomination of desolation walking alive down the long straight street and the rest is as this gentleman has said .
" I ' ve got only one thing to say .
asked his companion patiently .
" That is true ," assented the priest , with respect .
went on Flambeau eagerly .
" And now , take it from the start .
After a long ruminant pause , the priest said : " You miss a logical step .
Suppose -- but , here we are , my friend ."
You see , I rather guess you have guessed it all yourself ."
It was empty of all occupants but one .
" Is this man a coin - collector ?"
But it was too late .
Across the table the body of the man in the brown dressing - gown lay amid his burst and gaping brown - paper parcels ; out of which poured and rolled , not Roman , but very modern English coins .
The priest held up the bronze head of Caesar .
He hated the Roman money he had , and grew fonder of the real money denied him .
" What is there wrong about a miser that is not often as wrong about a collector ?
VII .
His life was a series of distracted compromises between the proprietor of the paper ( and of him ), who was a senile soap - boiler with three ineradicable mistakes in his mind , and the very able staff he had collected to run the paper ; some of whom were brilliant and experienced men and ( what was even worse ) sincere enthusiasts for the political policy of the paper .
DEAR NUTT ,-- As I see you ' re working Spooks and Dooks at the same time , what about an article on that rum business of the Eyres of Exmoor ; or as the old women call it down here , the Devil ' s Ear of Eyre ?
The legend , you ' ll probably remember , was about the blackest business in English history -- the poisoning of Overbury by that witch ' s cat Frances Howard , and the quite mysterious terror which forced the King to pardon the murderers .
Another tradition says that Cavaliers just after James I began to wear their hair long only to cover the ear of the first Lord Exmoor .
I suggest a series of articles pointing out how dreary , how inhuman , how downright diabolist , is the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses .
He will use the real names of the parties , who in most cases are ready to confirm his testimony .
Looking at him again , more strictly , I could not exactly say what it was that gave me the sense of antiquity , except the antique cut of his white clerical necktie and the barred wrinkles across his brow .
I thought the subject seemed to embarrass the other two a little ; but it broke the spell of the third man ' s silence most successfully .
And all this red roll of impieties came from his thin , genteel lips rather primly than otherwise , as he sat sipping the wine out of his tall , thin glass .
Then he said at last , " Don ' t you know who he is ?"
" You don ' t mean that fable about the fantastic ear ?"
I demanded .
" No ," he groaned .
Understand , I ' ve no reason to defend him , or even keep faith with him .
He has been a tyrant to me as to everybody else .
He would fetch a man a mile to ring a bell a yard off -- if it would summon another man three miles to fetch a matchbox three yards off .
" But not a valet to brush his clothes ," cut in the priest , with a curious dryness , " for the valet would want to brush his wig , too ."
He lets the whole world do everything for him -- except dress him .
Anybody is kicked out of the house without a character who is so much as found near his dressing - room door .,
Instead of using funds he held in trust , he took advantage of the Duke ' s carelessness to put the family in a financial hole , in which it might be necessary for the Duke to let him hold them in reality .
The sequel certainly could not be overlooked ; for the Duke , in dead silence , smashed a decanter on the man ' s bald head as suddenly as I had seen him smash the glass that day in the orchard .
He rose tottering to his feet , and struck back as such men do strike .
Why ?
But before I end this half of my discoveries , I think it due to Dr Mull to record that my two first inquiries have confirmed his story .
I freely confess it is quite different from anything I expected to discover , and will give a much more practical shock to the public .
The big librarian had left the table , perhaps ashamed of his long tongue , perhaps anxious about the storm in which his mysterious master had vanished : anyway , he betook himself heavily in the Duke ' s tracks through the trees .
" What a lovely colour a lemon is !"
" I don ' t think I understand ," I answered .
Why doesn ' t he conceal the family curse better , if he ' s really so ashamed of it ?
" And think ," he went on , " of that stream of blood and poison that spurted from his thin lips the instant you so much as mentioned his ancestors .
If I gave you the faintest hint of the load of horror I have to bear alone , you would lie shrieking at these feet of mine and begging to know no more .
" I know his name ; it is Satan .
The true God was made flesh and dwelt among us .
You would have an instant to know the great Nothing before you died ."
The priest walked straight up to him , but strangely enough did not even glance at his ears .
Though ( in one sense ) he wears another man ' s wig and claims another man ' s ear , he has not stolen another man ' s coronet .
They like that But you must know the Exmoors would never forgive this .
Why , Sir Simon is one of Exmoor ' s greatest pals ; and it would ruin that cousin of the Eyres that ' s standing for us at Bradford .
FATHER BROWN was in no mood for adventures .
This Cecil Fanshaw was , in person , of the kind that commonly urges such crude but pleasing enthusiasms ; a very young man , light - haired , high - coloured , with an eager profile ; with a boyish bravado of spirits , but an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type .
The big shoulders , black brows and black mousquetaire swagger of Flambeau were a great contrast .
For as the river mouth narrowed like the neck of a bottle , and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly , he seemed to wake up and take notice like a baby .
If Father Brown ever attached any importance to either of these , he certainly forgot them at the next turn of the river which brought in sight a singular object .
The water seemed to widen and split , being cloven by the dark wedge of a fish - shaped and wooded islet .
With the rate at which they went , the islet seemed to swim towards them like a ship ; a ship with a very high prow -- or , to speak more strictly , a very high funnel .
Yet it appeared to be built entirely of wood , and that in a most unequal and eccentric way .
These black beams were set crooked or crisscross at all kinds of angles , giving the whole a most patchy and puzzling appearance .
Through a gap in the foliage there appeared for a moment one of those old wooden houses , faced with black beams , which are still to be found here and there in England , but which most of us see imitated in some show called " Old London " or " Shakespeare ' s England '.
" What on earth ' s this ?"
Fanshaw ' s eyes were shining , and he spoke triumphantly .
The spirit of Raleigh and Hawkins is a memory with the Devon folk ; it ' s a modern fact with the Pendragons .
King Arthur was here and Merlin and the fairies before him .
A second Spaniard , who was the brother of the first , instantly drew his sword and flew at Pendragon , and after a short but furious combat in which both got three wounds in as many minutes , Pendragon drove his blade through the other ' s body and the second Spaniard was accounted for .
And turning again to face the ship , and holding up both arms to Heaven -- like a prophet calling plagues upon a wicked city -- he called out to Pendragon in a piercing and terrible voice , that he at least was yet living , that he would go on living , that he would live for ever ; and that generation after generation the house of Pendragon should never see him or his , but should know by very certain signs that he and his vengeance were alive .
" Never mind girls ," said Fanshaw impatiently , " there are plenty of them in the world , but not many things like the Pendragon Tower .
" When did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history ?"
asked Father Brown , as the girl in the canoe paddled off , without showing the least intention of extending her interest from the tower to the yacht , which Fanshaw had already caused to lie alongside the island .
" Many years ago ," replied Fanshaw ; " he hasn ' t been to sea for some time now , though he is as keen on it as ever .
But I ' ll only carve another bit off the front door , and then come out and welcome you ."
And sure enough , he heaved up his weapon once more , and , hacking twice , brought down another and similar strip of fence , making the opening about fourteen feet wide in all .
" Well , perhaps I do go at it a bit rabidly , and feel a kind of pleasure in smashing anything .
But Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter or the astonishment .
The second was clearer : an old Elizabethan galley with decorative waves beneath it , but interrupted in the middle by a curious jagged rock , which was either a fault in the wood or some conventional representation of the water coming in .
" But it seems rather odd ," said Flambeau , " that it should exactly confirm the old legend ."
" It so happens ," replied his host coolly , " that there was no thunder and lightning at all in the two or three shipwrecks I know of in our family ."
Someone saw a blaze hereabout , don ' t you know , as he walked home through a wood ; someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower .
Don ' t you really believe in the family story at all ?"
Then he said , without altering his tone .
The Admiral lifted the hairless arches over his eyes and exclaimed : " Well , I don ' t know where you got it , but the truth is I can ' t stand the fellow , though I ' ve no excuse for discharging a family servant .
he cried ; " and so had that girl !"
If all the Pendragons sailed about anyhow , he thought there would be too much chance of natural catastrophes to prove anything .
His body was never found .
I tell you it was from perfectly natural mishap ; lots of other people besides Pendragons were drowned ; and both disasters are discussed in a normal way by navigators .
The girl he ' s engaged to was coming today ; but I was so afraid of some chance delay frightening her that I wired her not to come till she heard from me .
We ' ll crack that old lie when we crack a bottle of this wine ."
Do you know that in my business you ' re an exorcist almost before anything else ?"
I am an atheist ."
Admiral Pendragon sat down again as abruptly as he had risen ; but he sat quite still , and when he spoke again it was in a lower voice .
They followed him , laughing and half remonstrating ; but he replied with the utmost solemnity , explaining to them , in a maddening little sermon , that one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to others .
He did not find a spud ; but he found an old broom made of twigs , with which he began energetically to brush the fallen leaves off the grass .
" Always some little thing to be done ," he said with idiotic cheerfulness ; " as George Herbert says : ` Who sweeps an Admiral ' s garden in Cornwall as for Thy laws makes that and the action fine .'
Almost as he spoke the huge figure of the hairy gardener appeared on a higher ridge of the trenched and terraced lawn , hailing them with a brandished rake and a horribly bellowing voice .
As he spoke a most beautiful rose - red light seemed to burst into blossom like a gigantic rose ; but accompanied with a crackling and rattling noise that was like the laughter of devils .
" My God !
At the same instant the monstrous figure of the gardener with the streaming beard stood again on the green ridge against the sky , waving others to come on ; but now waving not a rake but a cutlass .
When the priest heard the voice , a terrible change came over his countenance .
The other was : " As soon as you get a chance , call out to that canoeing girl ; she ' s over on the bank with the gipsies .
Ask her if they could get some buckets across and fill them from the river ."
" Oh , don ' t talk in these parables ," cried Flambeau impatiently .
The wicked uncle of the legends very nearly got his estate after all ."
He saw that the frustrated fire was extinguished ; and then refused to linger , though he actually heard young Pendragon , escorted by an enthusiastic crowd , come tramping up the river bank ; and might ( had he been moved by romantic curiosities ) have received the combined thanks of the man from the ship and the girl from the canoe .
So you saw that map among tropic birds and shells and thought it was a map of Pacific Islands .
" I was sea - sick ," said Father Brown simply .
If it was dreary in a hundred bleak offices and yawning drawing - rooms , it was drearier still along the edges of the flat Essex coast , where the monotony was the more inhuman for being broken at very long intervals by a lamp - post that looked less civilized than a tree , or a tree that looked more ugly than a lamp - post .
The line of the sea looked frozen in the very vividness of its violet - blue , like the vein of a frozen finger .
After walking a mile or two farther , they found that the shore was beginning to be formally embanked , so as to form something like a parade ; the ugly lamp - posts became less few and far between and more ornamental , though quite equally ugly .
Half a mile farther on Father Brown was puzzled first by little labyrinths of flowerless flower - pots , covered with the low , flat , quiet - coloured plants that look less like a garden than a tessellated pavement , between weak curly paths studded with seats with curly backs .
And with an agility hardly to be expected of him , he hopped up on to the raised platform .
Inland the little wintry gardens faded into a confused grey copse ; beyond that , in the distance , were long low barns of a lonely farmhouse , and beyond that nothing but the long East Anglian plains .
Seawards there was no sail or sign of life save a few seagulls : and even they looked like the last snowflakes , and seemed to float rather than fly .
Let me help you out ."
The Sacrifice ."
He was staring , with a knot in his forehead , at the landscape ; and he suddenly pointed at it .
Almost the whole frontage was of gilt plaster and figured glass , and between that grey seascape and the grey , witch - like trees , its gimcrack quality had something spectral in its melancholy .
In this , however , they were not altogether confirmed .
As they drew nearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet , which was apparently closed , one of the iron garden - seats with curly backs that had adorned the gardens , but much longer , running almost the whole length of the frontage .
Behind the table and on the seat sat a dark - haired young man , bareheaded , and gazing at the sea in a state of almost astonishing immobility .
" My waiters are all Italians , you see , and I thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the black , if he really can do it .
You know the great fight between Malvoli and Nigger Ned is coming off after all ?"
He could only say amiably : " Oh , thank you very much ."
" Oh , it doesn ' t really matter ," began Flambeau , but the man turned to reassure him .
" I could find my way in the dark ."
He was interrupted by a bellowing human voice that came out of the bowels of the uninhabited hotel .
Flambeau had often heard that negroes made good cooks .
We only met one man for miles ."
The hotel proprietor shrugged his shoulders .
" They come from the other end of the town , you see -- from the station , three miles from here .
They are only interested in the sport , and will stop in hotels for the night only .
He was a quiet , well - featured fellow , rather sallow ; his dark clothes had nothing distinctive about them , except that his black necktie was worn rather high , like a stock , and secured by a gold pin with some grotesque head to it .
The silence that ensued was broken by their host saying quietly : " Whereabouts did you meet the one man on your march ?"
Flambeau , who had sat on the long iron seat to finish his sherry , put it down and rose to his feet , staring at his friend in amazement .
As has been said , the hotel - keeper can be proved to have told the precise truth .
But somehow the black man was like the black hat .
The red flower stood up in his buttonhole aggressively , as if it had suddenly grown there .
It was fixed at the throat rather in the way that nurses fix children ' s comforters with a safety - pin .
The man sitting on the long iron bench was also gazing placidly out to sea .
The motionless man continued to gaze at the sea , and the eyes in his head might have belonged to two different men .
Father Brown had his back to him , and in that flash might have fallen dead on his face .
Flambeau bent over it an instant in violent silence , and then said : " The door is locked ."
And I felt that no one would ever be happy there again ."
A man was found strangled , it was said , on the Downs round that part .
And , short of that , the more alone he is , the more certain he is to be seen .
cried Flambeau in great surprise , as his clerical friend stumped straight up the broad steps .
They passed rapidly through ante - rooms and inner rooms ; they passed through the hall of combat itself , raised , roped , and padded with innumerable seats and boxes , and still the cleric did not look round or pause till he came to a clerk at a desk outside a door marked " Committee ".
In a few moments the rather baffled Flambeau found himself in the presence of a man who was still shouting directions to another man going out of the room .
He was half grey and half flaxen , and he had the eyes of fever and a high - bridged , frost - bitten nose .
" Only a word ," said Father Brown .
" Is your friend mad ?"
" Far from it ," was the reply .
You know what these Mediterranean races are like .
If I send out word that it ' s off we shall have Malvoli storming in here at the head of a whole Corsican clan ."
" My lord , it is a matter of life and death ," said the priest .
The nobleman struck the bell on the table with an odd air of new curiosity .
He said to the clerk who appeared almost instantly in the doorway : " I have a serious announcement to make to the audience shortly .
asked Lord Pooley abruptly .
" I consulted a bandstand ," said Father Brown , scratching his head .
"` The only form in which Voodoo --'" began Father Brown , reading aloud .
" In which what ?"
" My name is Pooley ," replied the other , with a creditable coolness .
" And I advise you just now to leave the country ."
That negro who has just swaggered out is one of the most dangerous men on earth , for he has the brains of a European , with the instincts of a cannibal .
Lord Pooley ' s eyes recovered their frosty twinkle as he looked at the little clergyman .
Have you never seen one ploughman from the heights , or one shepherd from the valleys ?
Have you never walked along a cliff , and seen one man walking along the sands ?
No !
" There is only one ," said the priest .
The twisting of a neck - cloth , the thrusting of a body behind a door could be done in an instant -- so long as it was that instant .
That is the little trick Nigger Ned has adopted from his old God of Gongs ."
" By the way , Malvoli --" Pooley began .
I dare say he has some Italians with him , but our amiable friends are not Italians .
" And I ' m sure he wouldn ' t whiten his face ."
X .
At yet more distant intervals appeared the houses upon the broken fringe of the suburb ; their outlines became clearer and clearer until he recognized many in which he had chance acquaintances , and many more the names of whose owners he knew .
It was the unmistakable noise of a pistol or carbine or some light firearm discharged ; but it was not this that puzzled him most .
He supposed it must be the echo ; but the odd thing was that the echo was not in the least like the original sound .
It was not like anything else that he could think of ; the three things nearest to it seemed to be the noise made by siphons of soda - water , one of the many noises made by an animal , and the noise made by a person attempting to conceal laughter .
Father Brown was made of two men .
Then the grey sky - line brightened into silver , and in the broadening light he realized that he had been to the house which belonged to an Anglo - Indian Major named Putnam ; and that the Major had a native cook from Malta who was of his communion .
But the face was a good - humoured one , and even now , though evidently puzzled and inquisitive , wore a kind of innocent grin .
He had a large palm - leaf hat on the back of his head ( suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face ), but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas ; which , though glowing enough to behold , must have been , on a fresh morning , pretty chilly to wear .
All this Father Brown absorbed in detail more at leisure .
" It ' s lucky you didn ' t turn your artillery on him or you might have given him quite a bad cold ."
Then , after a bewildered pause , he said : " Was it a burglar ?"
The interior exhibited a paradox often to be marked in such morning hours : that the rooms seemed brighter than the sky outside ; even after the Major had turned out the one gaslight in the front hall .
" I suppose we ' d better follow him outside ," he said .
They passed out into the morning light , which was now even tinged with sunshine , and saw Colonel Cray ' s tall figure bent almost double , minutely examining the condition of gravel and grass .
He was indeed emphatic , but then he was talking to his cook -- the swarthy son of Malta , whose lean , yellow and rather careworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow - white cap and costume .
In the new presence of daylight and people clothed and in their right mind , the sight of him was rather a shock .
The taller and more elegant man was still in his night - garb , with tousled black hair , and now crawling about the garden on his hands and knees , still looking for traces of the burglar ; and now and again , to all appearance , striking the ground with his hand in anger at not finding him .
" I prefer it ," said Putnam , placably .
I wish to goodness now you hadn ' t asked Cousin Oliver to take me to the musical service .
There was nothing in all this that could conceivably concern the tragedy in Miss Watson ' s face ; and by a half conscious instinct , Father Brown turned again to the seeming lunatic grubbing about in the grass .
" And what is that ?"
During the last words Cray had sprung or staggered to his feet and was regarding the cleric with agitated eyes .
he cried .
I was engaged to Audrey out there ; and we all travelled back together .
There was nothing to do but to walk forward ; which I did through passage after passage , pitch - dark .
I shrank back out of its way , and could not help thinking of the words in the temple .
Existence was an agony of extinction ; I dashed my head against walls until I dashed it against a window ; and fell rather than jumped into the garden below .
" The third happened in Malta .
Father Brown threw away a daisy - chain he was making , and rose with a wistful look .
" Has Major Putnam ," he asked , " got any Eastern curios , idols , weapons and so on , from which one might get a hint ?"
Cray introduced him civilly enough , as Dr Oman , but he showed such disfavour in his very face that Brown guessed the two men , whether Audrey knew it or not , were rivals .
Nor was the priest wholly unsympathetic with the prejudice .
And he ran his eyes over the stew - pots or other strange utensils on the wall .
I can ' t eat it , but I ' ll mix it like an angel !
" I will go for the police !"
With that he went outside and spoke for a moment to the doctor .
The doctor and the priest walked slowly towards the garden gate .
" A very small thing ," said Oman ; " but it kept me restless in church till I came back to see that all was well .
MR CALHOUN KIDD was a very young gentleman with a very old face , a face dried up with its own eagerness , framed in blue - black hair and a black butterfly tie .
In the bar parlour he rang the bell , and had to wait some little time for a reply to it .
" It ' s a few yards down the road ," said the red - haired man , removing his cigar ; " I shall be passing it myself in a minute , but I ' m going on to Pendragon Park to try and see the fun ."
asked the other pressman , looking up .
" I have come to see Mr Boulnois ," said Kidd .
" Are you interested in Catastrophism ?"
Smart Society , I regret to say , felt none of that interest in Boulnois on Darwin which was such a credit to the head and hearts of the Western Sun .
A year or two before , Boulnois had married a beautiful and not unsuccessful actress , to whom he was devoted in his own shy and ponderous style ; and the proximity of the household to Champion ' s had given that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving in a way that could not but cause painful and rather base excitement .
" Old Boulnois may be squared -- or he may be square .
Inside the garden hedge , he could see that the house , though unpretentious enough , was larger and more luxurious than it looked at first , and was quite a different kind of place from a porter ' s lodge .
" But see here , I had an appointment ," said the interviewer , with a rising voice .
Kidd started a little .
he asked rather vaguely .
" But perhaps he ' s gone over to make a row .
In that case I reckon a man from the Western Sun will be on the spot ."
For we human beings are used to inappropriate things ; we are accustomed to the clatter of the incongruous ; it is a tune to which we can go to sleep .
It fell on the pathway far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle .
Kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight clinging to that idle clock .
Though he saw it there only for a moment , though it was outlandish and incredible in costume , being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson , with glints of gold , yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was .
The moonlight discoloured everything , against Dalroy ' s red hair his wan face looked not so much white as pale green .
" Boulnois ... with my own sword ... he threw it ..."
Again the failing hand waved towards the sword , and then fell rigid with a thud .
" I was too late to save the man , but I guess I was in time to hear something of importance .
The doctor stared at him gloomily with a reddening brow --, but he did not contradict .
His butler told me so .
asked James Dalroy , and again Kidd was conscious of an irrational desire to hit him on his curling mouth .
" I fear I ' m no use here ," he said , with a brief sigh .
And he walked away up the dark avenue towards the house , his hands clasped behind him and his big head bent in cogitation .
He did not answer the question , but asked another : " Have you seen your husband ?"
" He has nothing to do with this ."
But such as they are , they don ' t fit in with Mr Boulnois being the murderer ."
He turned his blank , round face up to the stars and continued absentmindedly : " To take the vague idea first .
I attach a good deal of importance to vague ideas .
Please do not think I mean that Boulnois could not be so wicked .
Anybody can be wicked -- as wicked as he chooses .
These were on a polished surface .
Whose prints they were I have no earthly clue ; but why should anybody hold a sword half - way down ?
An extraordinary expression flashed across her face , very different from pity , modesty , remorse , or anything her companion had expected : her voice became suddenly strong and full .
But he couldn ' t be got to conceive the notion of envying Champion .
I answer that I could not have declined them except by explaining to my husband , and there are some things the soul cannot do , as the body cannot fly .
Nobody could do it now .
Well , John was to come and see us act this evening , but just as we were starting he said he wouldn ' t ; he had got an interesting book and a cigar .
He stabbed himself , crying out like a devil that Boulnois was slaying him ; he lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy , and John is sitting in the dining - room reading a book ."
Your husband is not sitting in the dining - room reading a book .
" Oh , the servants will be back by now ," she said , wondering .
" Right , right !"
rejoined the cleric energetically , and set off scuttling up the path towards the Park gates .
" You don ' t understand ," said Mrs Boulnois .
In fact , he had the air of sitting where he had sat when his dinner was cleared away .
" I shan ' t interrupt you a moment .
The little sins are sometimes harder to confess than the big ones -- but that ' s why it ' s so important to confess them .
Then that bell rang , and I thought for one long , mortal minute that I couldn ' t get out of that chair -- literally , physically , muscularly couldn ' t .
Then I did it like a man lifting the world , because I knew all the servants were out .
His hair was parted in the middle , and I tell you that murder --"
" I didn ' t commit murder ," continued the Catastrophist mildly , " but only perjury .
It had come under the Prussian hegemony quite late in history -- hardly fifty years before the fine summer day when Flambeau and Father Brown found themselves sitting in its gardens and drinking its beer .
There had been not a little of war and wild justice there within living memory , as soon will be shown .
For it was brilliant weather .
Despite his prosaic appearance and generally practical walk of life , Father Brown was not without a certain streak of romance in his composition , though he generally kept his daydreams to himself , as many children do .
But he never composed anything in the form of fiction , unless it be the tale that follows :
asked Father Brown .
" Don ' t you know the story of the late Prince of this place ?
He was a soldier of distinguished skill and success , but he didn ' t have altogether an easy job with this little place .
Or something of that kind .
" Perhaps you know as much about it as I do .
" Died ," repeated Flambeau , " and that ' s about as much as we can say .
" Human science can never be quite certain of things like that ," said Father Brown , still looking at the red budding of the branches over his head , " if only because of the difficulty about definition and connotation .
Perhaps it looked like a thimble or something .
He was a very able detective in the German service , and he tried to arrest me ; I arrested him instead , and we had many interesting chats .
" On the evening in question , it seems , the Prince was expected to appear in one of the outer rooms , because he had to receive certain visitors whom he really wished to meet .
It was a brilliant gathering , but very late , and gradually the Chamberlain -- you saw his portrait , too : a man with black eyebrows , serious eyes , and a meaningless sort of smile underneath -- the Chamberlain , I say , discovered there was everything there except the Prince himself .
He searched all the outer salons ; then , remembering the man ' s mad fits of fear , hurried to the inmost chamber .
That also was empty , but the steel turret or cabin erected in the middle of it took some time to open .
" What an odd person you are !"
he said .
" Of course ," said the priest , " when a grown up girl is really picking flowers , she picks them with plenty of stalk .
And there was no pistol , though there were two pistol shots .
" Don ' t think me rude .
" All right ," said Flambeau , laughing , and finished his beer .
They might have been cherubs flying home to the casements of a sort of celestial nursery .
" No doubt you ' ve heard of his career , which was rather romantic .
Perhaps I ought to say he died of having a sash .
By what ?"
For this he had , somewhat reluctantly , paid and promised money on the chance of gaining the larger amount ; and for this he had stolen out of his palace like a thief in the rain , for he had thought of another way to get the desire of his eyes , and to get it cheap .
" Away at the upper end of a rambling mountain path to which he was making his way , among the pillared rocks along the ridge that hangs above the town , stood the hermitage , hardly more than a cavern fenced with thorn , in which the third of the great brethren had long hidden himself from the world .
Rifles ranked so close even to that mountain path that a cry from him would bring the soldiers rushing up the hill , to say nothing of the fact that the wood and ridge were patrolled at regular intervals ; rifles so far away , in the dim woods , dwarfed by distance , beyond the river , that an enemy could not slink into the town by any detour .
And round the palace rifles at the west door and the east door , at the north door and the south , and all along the four facades linking them .
He found himself on a small platform of rock , broken abruptly by the three corners of precipice .
The bronze or copper of it had grown green with the eating airs of that exalted place , and Otto had instantly the thought , " Even if they had arms , they must be rusted by now ."
He was evidently reading some daily lesson as part of his religious exercises .
He was half - way towards the gardens of the palace before he even tried to tear the strangling scarf from his neck and jaws .
A dumb devil was in him .
He felt himself repeating the phrases of his former mood with a murderous irony .
The stalk was stronger than he expected , and broke with a slight snap .
" The sentry who had fired , according to the strict orders of the garrison , naturally ran forward to find some trace of his quarry .
He was a private named Schwartz , since not unknown in his profession , and what he found was a bald man in uniform , but with his face so bandaged by a kind of mask made of his own military scarf that nothing but open , dead eyes could be seen , glittering stonily in the moonlight .
Whether the young lady named Hedwig had any previous knowledge of the soldier she saved and eventually married , or whether she came accidentally upon the accident and their intimacy began that night , we shall probably never know .
She remained by the body and gave the alarm ; and there was nothing to connect her with the disaster either , since she had not got , and could not have , any firearms .
" I wonder what part -- I wonder if a man is less a traitor when he is twice a traitor ?"
To Edmund Clerihew Bentley
Science announced nonentity and art admired decay ; The world was old and ended : but you and I were gay ; Round us in antic order their crippled vices came -- Lust that had lost its laughter , fear that had lost its shame .
Yea , cool and clear and sudden as a bird sings in the grey , Dunedin to Samoa spoke , and darkness unto day .
Even if the people were not " artists ," the whole was nevertheless artistic .
That old gentleman with the wild , white beard and the wild , white hat -- that venerable humbug was not really a philosopher ; but at least he was the cause of philosophy in others .
On many nights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high , didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to women .
It looked like the end of the world .
For a long time the red - haired revolutionary had reigned without a rival ; it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended .
" It may well be ," he said , in his sudden lyrical manner , " it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet .
The man with the meek blue eyes and the pale , pointed beard endured these thunders with a certain submissive solemnity .
The man who throws a bomb is an artist , because he prefers a great moment to everything .
The poet delights in disorder only .
It is because they know that the train is going right .
We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird .
Give me Bradshaw , I say !"
inquired Gregory sarcastically .
You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria .
You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea - sick .
For the first time a red patch appeared on Gregory ' s forehead .
" No , I don ' t ," he said ; " but I suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism , that is exactly what you would do ."
" Mr . Syme ," she said , " do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say ?
" Only in that sense I speak of ," replied Syme ; " or if you prefer it , in that nonsense ."
She drew her broad brows together and said abruptly --
Syme broke into a great laugh , that seemed too large for his slight and somewhat dandified figure .
he said , " that has to be done anonymously ."
And it is always the humble man who talks too much ; the proud man watches himself too closely .
He stared and talked at the girl ' s red hair and amused face for what seemed to be a few minutes ; and then , feeling that the groups in such a place should mix , rose to his feet .
He left with a sense of champagne in his head , which he could not afterwards explain .
For what followed was so improbable , that it might well have been a dream .
Only a fringe of fiery hair against the light , and also something aggressive in the attitude , proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory .
" I am very sorry ," replied Syme with gravity .
" I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology ," said Gregory very calmly .
You think me a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths .
You do not think that in a deeper , a more deadly sense , I am serious ."
Syme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road .
" Good Lord !
" Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of Adam , and especially not to the police ?
If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about , I will promise you in return --"
THE SECRET OF GABRIEL SYME
Syme received the remark with stolidity , imagining it to be a joke .
Accepting the vein of humour , he said , with a well - bred indifference --
and went away apparently to get it .
But the champagne can really be trusted .
His further attempts at conversation , somewhat disorganised in themselves , were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the actual appearance of the lobster .
Then he suddenly began to eat with great rapidity and appetite .
asked Syme , emptying his champagne glass .
" It is quite simple ," replied Gregory .
said Syme shortly .
Then after a pause he added --
" Well , if I am not drunk , I am mad ," replied Syme with perfect calm ; " but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either condition .
How simple that is !"
It was an enormous crimson lantern , nearly as big as a fireplace , fixed over a small but heavy iron door .
Inside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a network of steel .
" I know your passion for law and order ," and he stepped into the passage lined with the steel weapons .
That way you have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession .
You want to abolish Government ?"
" You spoke of a second question ," snapped Gregory .
May I ask why , after taking all this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth , you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in Saffron Park ?"
Nor do they believe me .
I was misinformed .
When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing - room I cried out in a voice of thunder , ' Down !
I was nabbed at once .
abstractedly , like a man calling for wine .
he roared so that the room shook .
It is curious you should mention the matter , because the very night you have dropped in ( if I may so express it ) is the night on which our London branch , which assembles in this room , has to elect its own deputy to fill a vacancy in the Council .
" I feel somehow as if you were my mother , Syme ," he continued casually .
" As a matter of fact , everything is ready for me on this table ," he said , " and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible ."
Syme , who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor , got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation .
Why do I positively like you , Gregory ?"
There was a thoughtful silence again , and then he cried out --
I swore before God that I would not tell your secret to the police .
Will you swear by Humanity , or whatever beastly thing you believe in , that you will not tell my secret to the anarchists ?"
" Have you got a secret ?"
But look sharp , for they will be here in a couple of minutes ."
We have known the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard ."
he asked in an inhuman voice .
From the doorway there came a murmur of " Mr . Joseph Chamberlain ."
CHAPTER III
BEFORE one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway , Gregory ' s stunned surprise had fallen from him .
He caught up the Colt ' s revolver and took aim at Syme .
" Don ' t you see it ' s not necessary ?
" I am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate ."
" If you ask my advice as a friend ," said Syme with severe benevolence , " I think you ' d better ."
He would let out as little as possible of their plans that night , and then let Syme go , and chance it .
There was a stir of almost inaudible applause , such as is sometimes heard in church .
Then a large old man , with a long and venerable white beard , perhaps the only real working - man present , rose lumberingly and said --
" Does anyone second ?"
But he was smiling and altogether at ease .
I know that he will not hear it tonight , though my passion were to rend the roof .
But if , by some incredible accident , there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us , I would put this question to him : ' When those Christians met in those Catacombs , what sort of moral reputation had they in the streets above ?
But only the eye of a friendship as deep and delicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of solid meekness which lies at the base of him , too deep even for himself to see .
" Shame !"
In our society , at any rate , which loves him sincerely , which is founded upon love --"
His sentence was drowned in a deafening cataract of applause .
" Stop , you --"
The voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent .
he said , in a voice as heavy as stone .
" This man cannot be elected .
Strike , but hear me !
" It was you that entrapped me ," began Gregory , shaking from head to foot , " entrapped me into --"
" You have kept your word ," he said gently , with his face in shadow .
" What do you mean ?"
cried the chaotic Gregory .
The more his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude ; and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism , the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism .
He had been blind and deaf for a moment , and then seen , the smoke clearing , the broken windows and the bleeding faces .
The red river reflected the red sky , and they both reflected his anger .
The sky , indeed , was so swarthy , and the light on the river relatively so lurid , that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirrored .
" The soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle ," pursued the policeman .
" The composure of an army is the anger of a nation ."
said Syme .
" Where did you have it ?"
The class sympathies which , false as they are , are the truest things in so many men , broke out of Syme before he could control them .
" I know ," he said solemnly , " I know I am not worthy ."
" But why did you join the police ?"
" I found that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and excusable , though excessive , outbreaks of the human will .
" You have evidently not heard of the latest development in our police system ," replied the other .
We are keeping it rather dark from the educated class , because that class contains most of our enemies .
I think you might almost join us ."
asked Syme .
I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate .
We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals .
Thieves respect property .
Yes , the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious , the harrying of the poor , the spying upon the unfortunate .
I don ' t know what you ' re doing , but you ' re wasting your life .
You might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood .
I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section , the inner ring the supremely guilty section .
" Oh !"
" How can I join you ?"
inquired Syme , with interest .
Do come along ."
You are engaged ."
The sword - stick became almost the sword of chivalry , and the brandy the wine of the stirrup - cup .
For even the most dehumanised modern fantasies depend on some older and simpler figure ; the adventures may be mad , but the adventurer must be sane .
So this inhuman landscape was only imaginative by the presence of a man really human .
But even the moon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon .
For the man remained more still than would have been natural if a stranger had come so close .
" If we walk up towards Leicester Square ," he said , " we shall just be in time for breakfast .
" I shall try to get to bed after breakfast ."
But the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President , for his notions grow like a tropical forest .
Well , he is the only man on earth , I know ; but sometimes I really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age .
" And what do the people say ?"
And this effect increased in Syme the sensation , which in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure , the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new world .
In fact , it did contain a dining - table , or more strictly a breakfast - table ; and round the breakfast - table , glowing in the sunlight and evident to the street , were a group of noisy and talkative men , all dressed in the insolence of fashion , with white waistcoats and expensive button - holes .
When Syme had seen him , his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone .
Twice already that night little unmeaning things had peeped out at him almost pruriently , and given him a sense of drawing nearer and nearer to the head - quarters of hell .
His face was very large , but it was still possible to humanity .
In the presence of the President the whole company looked sufficiently commonplace ; nothing about them caught the eye at first , except that by the President ' s caprice they had been dressed up with a festive respectability , which gave the meal the look of a wedding breakfast .
His soul and speech were incurably tragic ; he could not force himself to play the prosperous and frivolous part demanded of him by President Sunday .
And , indeed , when Syme came in the President , with that daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy , was actually chaffing Gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces .
But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock - coat , and then goes about on his hands and knees -- well , he may attract attention .
That ' s what Brother Gogol does .
Now when you were found under Admiral Biffin ' s bed --"
The only metaphor he could think of was this , that they all looked as men of fashion and presence would look , with the additional twist given in a false and curved mirror .
Syme ' s original cicerone bore the title of Monday ; he was the Secretary of the Council , and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything , except the President ' s horrible , happy laughter .
But Syme , sensitive to such things , felt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him , a rich atmosphere that suffocated .
And in the gloom and thickness of the beard his dark red mouth showed sensual and scornful .
In the bright coloured Persian tiles and pictures showing tyrants hunting , you may see just those almond eyes , those blue - black beards , those cruel , crimson lips .
When he rose or sat down , which was with long labour and peril , something worse was expressed than mere weakness , something indefinably connected with the horror of the whole scene .
He could not help thinking that whenever the man moved a leg or arm might fall off .
They were deep in the discussion of an actual and immediate plot .
Even the instrument was chosen ; the black - bearded Marquis , it appeared , was to carry the bomb .
He had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and extraordinary way Sunday had found out that he was a spy .
Then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days .
In the presence of these powerful and repulsive men , who were the princes of anarchy , he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet Gregory , the mere aesthete of anarchism .
He even thought of him now with an old kindness , as if they had played together when children .
But this was a kind of modern meanness to which Syme could not sink even in his extreme morbidity .
Dr . Bull and the Marquis ate casually and conventionally of the best things on the table -- cold pheasant or Strasbourg pie .
The old Professor had such slops as suggested a sickening second childhood .
Dynamite is not only our best tool , but our best symbol .
" No , if the only end of the thing is nothing ," said Dr . Bull with his sphinx - like smile , " it hardly seems worth doing ."
He found himself filled with a supernatural courage that came from nowhere .
He felt towards them all that unconscious and elementary superiority that a brave man feels over powerful beasts or a wise man over powerful errors .
This liberation of his spirit from the load of his weakness went with a quite clear decision to embrace death .
If the people of the barrel - organ could keep their old - world obligations , so could he .
Zso !"
So that ' s all right .
Gogol sat down last , grumbling in his brown beard about gombromise .
They all stared at him ; then they all started in their seats , for the next words , though not loud , had a living and sensational emphasis .
Sunday went on smoothly --
I will waste no more words .
said Sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in his life , a voice that made men drop drawn swords .
" Well , my man ," said the President briskly , addressing him as one addresses a total stranger , " will you oblige me by putting your hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you have there ?"
" Right oh !"
It was irrational , as if a Chinaman had suddenly spoken with a Scotch accent .
" You bet ," answered the Pole .
On your discomfort I will not dwell .
" I must go off at once ; I have to take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting ."
The Secretary turned to him with working eyebrows .
He was one of those men who are conscientious even in crime .
But it might .
" That ' s where you fail right enough .
You fail to understand .
Four of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent glimmering of his meaning .
Syme alone had even a glimmering , and such as it was it froze him to the bone .
If the last words of the President meant anything , they meant that he had not after all passed unsuspected .
The Professor went last , very slowly and painfully .
He had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaurant , which was full of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners .
He remembered that in old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists .
The wine , the common food , the familiar place , the faces of natural and talkative men , made him almost feel as if the Council of the Seven Days had been a bad dream ; and although he knew it was nevertheless an objective reality , it was at least a distant one .
When he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the spot .
Then with a gesture as of blind hurry , he brushed past the Professor , dashing open the door and slamming it behind him , and stood outside in the snow .
" Can that old corpse be following me ?"
But the old man could only walk like a snail , and Syme had walked like the wind .
Syme sprang erect upon the rocking car , and after staring wildly at the wintry sky , that grew gloomier every moment , he ran down the steps .
He felt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses , and to get once more into the open and lamp - lit street .
At first he was startled to find these great roads so empty , as if a pestilence had swept through the city .
It had fallen accidentally , but just so fallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point , and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross .
When Syme saw it he suddenly straightened himself , and made with his sword - stick an involuntary salute .
He really looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the tortuous streets he had been threading .
He came nearer and nearer , the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles , his lifted , patient face .
The man ' s colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident .
This outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus , up Ludgate Hill , round St . Paul ' s Cathedral , along Cheapside , Syme remembering all the nightmares he had ever known .
Then Syme broke away towards the river , and ended almost down by the docks .
If the man had one character as a paralytic and another character as a pursuer , the antithesis might make him more interesting , but scarcely more soothing .
It was just possible that this escapade signified something other than even a slight suspicion of him .
He was just selecting a tentative inquiry , when the old Professor opposite suddenly and simply cut him short .
" A policeman ?"
he said , laughing vaguely .
I think so now ."
Perhaps policeman is a relative term .
Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham Common is only the policeman that might have been .
said the old man , ignoring all Syme ' s improvised and desperate raillery .
" Your suggestion is ridiculous ," he began .
You swear it !
Will there really be no mistake ?
He leant his angular elbow far across the table , and put up his large loose hand like a flap to his ear .
" I am a policeman ," said the Professor with his first broad smile .
Taking his own blue police ticket from his own waist coat pocket , he tossed it on to the table ; then he flung his head back until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the ceiling , and shouted with a barbaric laughter .
Even in that close den , perpetually filled with the din of knives , plates , cans , clamorous voices , sudden struggles and stampedes , there was something Homeric in Syme ' s mirth which made many half - drunken men look round .
Have some more beer .
said the other , in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt , " my milk !
Syme was staring at him with a happy curiosity .
I was thirty - eight last birthday ."
" We were three ," he said .
" If we had been three hundred we could still have done nothing ."
They were both silent for a measure of moments , and then Syme ' s speech came with a rush , like the sudden foaming of champagne .
" Yes , I am ," he said mildly .
Fight the thing that you fear .
Will you take the risk ?"
As to that I will say only one word , and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric .
The small streets were sloppy and full of pools , which reflected the flaming lamps irregularly , and by accident , like fragments of some other and fallen world .
" Where are you going ?"
Syme inquired .
Bull !"
The Professor , who seemed to know his way about the neighbourhood , proceeded to a place where the line of lighted shops fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet , in which an old white inn , all out of repair , stood back some twenty feet from the road .
" You can find good English inns left by accident everywhere , like fossils ," explained the Professor .
" It is ," said the Professor reverently , and went in .
It may be conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two .
But two is not twice one ; two is two thousand times one .
Even at the start I thought he was a bit too hairy ."
He made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist .
But I am a realist .
When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company .
I understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was God ; hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy , rending all things in pieces .
If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a caricature .
I made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old Professor ' s dirty old self .
I had drunk more champagne than was good for me , and in a flash of folly I decided to see the situation through .
' I don ' t fancy ,' he said , ' that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation , since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna , which are an essential of differentiation .'
Need I say that there is no hedgehog in Montaigne ?
' Your claptrap comes off ,' he said ; ' so would your beard .'
He is now , I believe , received everywhere in Europe as a delightful impostor .
His apparent earnestness and anger , you see , make him all the more entertaining ."
To my astonishment , as I was turning the corner , I felt a touch on the shoulder , and turning , found myself under the shadow of an enormous policeman .
This charge , if it was criminal at all , was certainly the lighter of the two , and I went along with the man , doubtful , but not greatly dismayed .
I was shown into a number of rooms , and eventually into the presence of a police officer , who explained that a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of anarchy , and that this , my successful masquerade , might be of considerable value to the public safety .
So that when I am among friends , and have no need at all to disguise myself , I still can ' t help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead -- just as if it were my forehead .
when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round , black head of Dr .
Bull ."
" I mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers .
He was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles , and with his hands at conjuring , and it did not take him long to learn how he might convey simple messages by what would seem to be idle taps upon a table or knee .
I wish this language of yours had a wider scope .
I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes ?
That would involve pulling off our boots and socks during the conversation , which however unobtrusively performed --"
Did you learn it all on the spot ?"
The Professor was silent ; his eyes were wide open , and he wore a fixed but very small smile .
Whether or no the Professor could answer , he did not .
Syme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank , blue eyes .
Was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor , who had turned for the last time ?
Syme was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past .
Syme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with these empty rooms and that austere daybreak .
There should have been the black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning .
His Dosition gave him a somewhat new appearance .
Thus the two black glasses that encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his skull , making him look like a death ' s - head .
It was with some momentary difficulty that the Professor broke silence and began , " I ' m sorry to disturb you so early , comrade ," said he , with a careful resumption of the slow de Worms manner .
" Please do not think me excessively abrupt ; but I advise you to alter those plans , or if it is too late for that , to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him .
Syme began to feel a new sickness and despair .
But here was daylight ; here was a healthy , square - shouldered man in tweeds , not odd save for the accident of his ugly spectacles , not glaring or grinning at all , but smiling steadily and not saying a word .
The Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way , and his protected eyes were still impenetrable .
All this time Syme had been staring at the Doctor almost as steadily as the Doctor stared at the Professor , but quite without the smile .
" Perhaps I should rather say ," said Syme on his fingers , " that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods ."
" Or yet again ," tapped Syme , " it is positive , as is the passionate red hair of a beautiful woman ."
He leant across the table , and said in a voice that could not be neglected --
Then Dr . Bull rose slowly , still smiling , and took off his spectacles .
It was all the spectacles .
" Project be damned !"
" Look at him !
There ' s my card ," and he flung down the blue card upon the table .
I nearly flung my arms round Gogol and embraced him , which would have been imprudent .
But as last I was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force , and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders .
And there the others all talked hopelessly .
And so it was , by George !
" What was that ?"
" Theoretically , I suppose , we ought to call the police ."
It ' s like breaking one ' s word to a child ."
If I did that I shouldn ' t know the difference between right and wrong ."
" I don ' t think you ' re mad ," said Syme .
asked the Professor .
The Marquis cannot deny that he is a gentleman .
And in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt , I propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off .
They went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze .
He professed to be making out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue between himself and the deadly Marquis .
He will say , ' The celebrated Mr . Syme , I presume .'
What are you really going to do ?"
I like to be just to my enemy ."
" It leads up to my challenge , don ' t you see ," said Syme , beaming .
asked the Professor peevishly , seeing that Syme still stood up without moving .
Syme drained his last glass of sparkling wine .
That meeting displeases me .
" Insulted you ?"
" Oh , just now ," said Syme recklessly .
" Oh , I assure you ," said Syme earnestly , " the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunt ' s weaknesses ."
said Syme indignantly .
" Seeking a quarrel with me !"
he cried .
These gentlemen will perhaps act for me .
Now you must insist , and insist absolutely , on the duel coming off after seven tomorrow , so as to give me the chance of preventing him from catching the 7 . 45 for Paris .
But I can fence well too , and I think I can keep him in play , at any rate , until the train is lost .
Syme could not help feeling a comic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and the rich and glistening meadow , growing wild flowers everywhere .
The member of the Legion of Honour , whose name it seemed was Colonel Ducroix , approached the Professor and Dr . Bull with great politeness , and suggested that the play should terminate with the first considerable hurt .
When the jar of the joined iron ran up Syme ' s arm , all the fantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking up in bed .
He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves -- how the fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare , and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science .
He felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him , in the grass under his feet ; he felt the love of life in all living things .
He could guess the reason of the Marquis ' s sudden madness of battle -- the Paris train was in sight .
Syme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as a gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground .
Yet the Marquis sprang back from the stroke without a stagger , and Syme stood staring at his own sword - point like an idiot .
There was an instant of rigid silence , and then Syme in his turn fell furiously on the other , filled with a flaming curiosity .
For this purpose , he aimed less at the Marquis ' s body , and more at his throat and head .
It came out clean .
Half mad , he thrust again , and made what should have been a bloody scar on the Marquis ' s cheek .
As the train came nearer and nearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral arches in Paris ; he joined in the growing noise and the glory of the great Republic whose gate he was guarding against Hell .
His thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train , which ended , as if proudly , in a long and piercing whistle .
The train stopped .
Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible ?
said the Marquis , recklessly throwing various parts of himself right and left about the field .
The mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture .
" You great silly , pink - faced , towheaded turnip !
I didn ' t care about catching the train ; I cared about whether the train caught me , and now , by God !
Perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of what was once your chin , your meaning would become clearer .
" What do you mean by ' us '?"
In the midst of this staggering transformation scene he stepped forward with all the gravity and responsibility of a second , and addressed the two seconds of the Marquis .
We are not buffoons , but very desperate men at war with a vast conspiracy .
asked Syme .
" What you say seems utterly wild ," began Syme .
But there were just five people , perhaps , who would have resisted him .
.
" Well ?"
" It was a habit of the late Marquis de St . Eustache ," said the new policeman , producing a leather case , " always to carry a pair of opera glasses .
He handed the field - glasses to the Doctor , who immediately took off his spectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes .
Syme almost tore the glasses out of his hand , and looked through them .
.
.
" Of course the President isn ' t with them .
" Something may have happened in our absence ; but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like that .
He has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself .
The others gave one glance over their shoulders , and saw that the dark cloud of men had detached itself from the station and was moving with a mysterious discipline across the plain .
The ex - Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes , and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half - masks of their pursuers .
Was anyone wearing a mask ?
With two impatient strides he overtook the man in the Marquis ' s straw hat , the man whom he had come to address as Ratcliffe .
" We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea ," he said .
" What can you mean by all this ?"
" Mere mobs !"
Why should it ?
" Its application is ," said his informant , " that most of old Sunday ' s right - hand men are South African and American millionaires .
That is why he has got hold of all the communications ; and that is why the last four champions of the anti - anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits ."
" Millionaires I can understand ," said Syme thoughtfully , " they are nearly all mad .
The man was a Norman , taller than the average of the French and very angular ; and his swarthy figure stood dark against a square of sunlight , almost like some allegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of gold .
" Mr . Syme is saying ," called out Ratcliffe to the French Colonel , " that this man , at least , will never be an anarchist ."
" That will never do ," said the Colonel ; " he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain ."
They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats , like any common crowd out of the streets ; but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack , as would be natural in an ordinary mob .
He is perhaps five hundred miles off , but the fear of him is on all of them , like the finger of God .
" May I ask you , Colonel ," he said in a low voice , " why we have come here ?"
The horses had been saddled none too soon .
" I am afraid ," said the Professor in his mirthful way , looking back along the white road on which the black , crawling patch might appear at any moment , " I am afraid we have hardly time for afternoon calls ."
" He has a motor - car ," said the Colonel .
" Yes , he is quite on your side ."
For a second they all sat as still as equestrian statues , and for a second -- for two or three or four seconds -- heaven and earth seemed equally still .
They breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear , and they rang the bell .
" Et ca ," cried out the Colonel suddenly , pointing over the other ' s shoulder , " and that is childishness , isn ' t it ?"
Let us go round to the garage ."
These , however , he seemed to use very sparingly , having the simple tastes of the French middle class , and when his impatient friends came to examine them , it took them some time to assure themselves that one of them even could be made to work .
" Where on earth did you get that ?"
" You were ," said Syme seriously , and hung the heavy lantern over the front .
If we turned and fought these fellows , the whole town would fight for us ."
There was a puzzled pause for some little time , and then the Colonel began again abruptly --
As the car sped on it left a floating patch of white smoke behind it , and Syme had heard a shot shriek past his ear .
" Pray resume your remarks , Colonel .
" It is extraordinary ," he said , " most extraordinary ."
" Well , if there is ," said Bull impatiently , " it must be something else -- a sham fight or the mayor ' s birthday or something .
" How do you know ?"
asked the professor , staring .
They peered again , and then the Colonel , with a catch in his voice , cried out --
There was , indeed , a rank of dim figures running across the road , and they could not be clearly seen ; but far enough in front to catch the accident of the evening light was stalking up and down the unmistakable Dr . Renard , in a white hat , stroking his long brown beard , and holding a revolver in his left hand .
" Of course , the dear old boy has turned out to help us ."
" Dr . Renard !
No , I may be mad , but humanity isn ' t ."
If you had got the man ' s character into your head --"
" Renard shall explain it .
" I won ' t ' ave it ," said Dr . Bull , growing more vulgar in the sincerity of his virtue .
" The poor chaps may be making a mistake .
" The morning star has fallen !"
" The world is insane !"
" Everyone is ," said Ratcliffe .
" We have one more chance ," said Syme , taking the steel out of his mouth .
They turned and faced the town .
Two or three men , looking little and black like monkeys , leapt over the edge as they had done and dropped on to the beach .
He splashed into the surf on a huge cart - horse , and shook his axe at them .
cried Syme .
" Even if the police do come now ," said the Professor mournfully , " they can do nothing with this mob ."
" Nonsence !"
" They are charging the mob !"
" No ; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless .
There is one insane little hope that I cannot get out of my mind .
The power of this whole planet is against us , yet I cannot help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet ."
" I also am holding hard on to the thing I never saw ."
" We cannot leave him among all those beasts ," cried Syme .
" Do not pity the Colonel ," said Ratcliffe , with a pale sneer .
" No !
no !"
" Will you believe your eyes ?"
" When my hand flies up ," said Syme , " it will strike somebody else ," and he strode along the pier towards the Colonel , the sword in one hand and the lantern in the other .
You did not light it , Better men than you , men who could believe and obey , twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire .
You can only destroy .
" Swords !"
Syme ' s sword was broken , but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman , flinging him down .
" There never was any Supreme Anarchist Council ," he said .
THE PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENT
What did it all mean ?
Damn it !
do you remember his face ?"
" I tell you I ' ve seen him !"
Here he is ," and he pulled forward by a reluctant elbow the identical young man who five days before had marched out of the Council with thin red hair and a pale face , the first of all the sham anarchists who had been exposed .
whispered Syme .
" We ' re all spies !"
" Of course , we all have our opinions and even our eyes , but really to call them disgusting before the man himself --"
Dr . Bull tore off his spectacles and broke them on the table .
" We have no time for tomfoolery ," said the Secretary , breaking in savagely .
What am I ?"
Grub in the roots of those trees and find out the truth about them .
You will understand the sea , and I shall be still a riddle ; you shall know what the stars are , and not know what I am .
With that he fell from the balcony , bouncing on the stones below like a great ball of india - rubber , and went bounding off towards the corner of the Alhambra , where he hailed a hansom - cab and sprang inside it .
He and Bull sprang into the cab together , the Professor and the Inspector into another , while the Secretary and the late Gogol scrambled into a third just in time to pursue the flying Syme , who was pursuing the flying President .
All this had its influence upon the President ' s cabman , who began to look dubious , and to slow down to a trot .
Then standing up in front of the cab himself , he lashed the horse and roared aloud , so that they went down the streets like a flying storm .
Through street after street and square after square went whirling this preposterous vehicle , in which the fare was urging the horse and the driver trying desperately to stop it .
Shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows .
Dr . Bull ' s address was , at any rate , considerably longer than his communication , for the communication consisted entirely of the words :--
" No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I . I trust it will not come to that .
The President ' s cabman seemed to be regaining some control over his horse , and the pursuers gained a little as they swept round into the Edgware Road .
howled Syme .
" Fly at once .
he asked .
" Why not say his black - beetles barking !"
said Syme furiously , " snails barking !
geraniums barking !
gasped the keeper .
" Has what ?"
asked Syme , with great curiosity .
" He is out of the gate !"
And even as he spoke , a final crash and roar of terror announced that the great grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the Zoological Gardens , and was careening down Albany Street like a new and swift sort of omnibus .
cried Bull , " I never knew an elephant could go so fast .
Well , it must be hansom - cabs again if we are to keep him in sight ."
He remembered a hornbill , which was simply a huge yellow beak with a small bird tied on behind it .
It was addressed to himself , and was quite a bulky parcel .
And still through all this insane publicity the three cabs toiled after it , until they came to be regarded as part of a procession , and perhaps the advertisement of a circus .
They went at such a rate that distances were shortened beyond belief , and Syme saw the Albert Hall in Kensington when he thought that he was still in Paddington .
The animal ' s pace was even more fast and free through the empty , aristocratic streets of South Kensington , and he finally headed towards that part of the sky - line where the enormous Wheel of Earl ' s Court stood up in the sky .
The wheel grew larger and larger , till it filled heaven like the wheel of stars .
Rustic Proverb ."
" Look !"
" Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon ?'
" What is there queer about a captive balloon ?"
" Ten thousand devils !"
shrieked the Secretary .
The balloon , borne by some chance wind , came right above them , and they could see the great white head of the President peering over the side and looking benevolently down on them .
I seemed to fancy that something fell on the top of my hat !"
CHAPTER XIV
" I wish the beastly gas - bag would burst !"
" Do you believe all that tale about his being our man in the dark room ?
" Well ," said Syme impatiently , " because ?"
" I don ' t understand a word of all that idea of his being the same man who gave us all our blue cards .
It seems to make everything nonsense .
But I don ' t care who knows it , I always had a sympathy for old Sunday himself , wicked as he was .
" You will not ," said the Secretary .
There is a kind of gaiety in the thing , as if he were bursting with some good news .
.
.
.
because he ' s such a Bounder ."
There was a long silence , and then the Secretary said in a curious , strained voice --
He listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring .
Do you ask me to forgive him that ?
But how will you bear an absentminded man who , if he happens to see you , will kill you ?
My early life , as you know , was a bit too large and loose .
Yet when I walked a little farther I found that there was no face , that the window was ten yards away , the lamp ten hundred yards , the cloud beyond the world .
Well , Sunday ' s face escaped me ; it ran away to right and left , as such chance pictures run away .
Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away .
" And then the queer thing happened .
On the contrary , it frightened me because it was so beautiful , because it was so good ."
" Syme ," exclaimed the Secretary , " are you ill ?"
I was suddenly possessed with the idea that the blind , blank back of his head really was his face -- an awful , eyeless face staring at me !
said Dr . Bull , and shuddered .
" Listen to me ," cried Syme with extraordinary emphasis .
It is that we have only known the back of the world .
If we could only get round in front --"
The man called Gogol , who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels , suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit .
" And now I know he was my friend -- my friend in the dark !"
" Pan again !"
" Let us follow it !"
" Oh , if he has cheated us all by getting killed !
" I was told you knew his name ," said the man respectfully .
There was a silence , and then the Secretary said --
" My master has only just come home ."
The hedges were ordinary hedges , the trees seemed ordinary trees ; yet he felt like a man entrapped in fairyland .
He looked the mysterious ambassador up and down , but he could discover nothing except that the man ' s coat was the exact colour of the purple shadows , and that the man ' s face was the exact colour of the red and brown and golden sky .
The six adventurers had passed through many adventures , but not one had carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure of comfort .
When the carriages eventually rolled up to a large , low , cavernous gateway , another man in the same uniform , but wearing a silver star on the grey breast of his coat , came out to meet them .
This impressive person said to the bewildered Syme --
He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary instinct of his class , to pull his tie straight or to smooth his hair ; and there he saw the frightful figure that he was -- blood running down his face from where the bough had struck him , his hair standing out like yellow rags of rank grass , his clothes torn into long , wavering tatters .
" Clothes !"
" Well , I don ' t understand anything ," said Syme , sighing .
" This is getting wilder and wilder ," said Syme , as he sat down in a chair .
CHAPTER XV
There was no need for Syme to search his memory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of creation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness .
Syme was scarcely surprised to notice that , amid all the ease and hospitality of their new surroundings , this man ' s eyes were still stern .
No smell of ale or orchards could make the Secretary cease to ask a reasonable question .
For he stood for that third day on which the earth and green things were made , and his square , sensible face , with its not unfriendly cynicism , seemed appropriate enough to it .
Cups were clashed and torches shaken , and feathered hats flung in the air .
The Secretary looked across the empty throne at Syme , and said , compressing his lips --
And the seven strange men were left alone , like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone .
Not one of them had spoken a word .
" We will eat and drink later ," he said .
You heard the voice in the dark , and you never heard it again .
I know you are contentment , optimism , what do they call the thing , an ultimate reconciliation .
" No ," said Syme , " I do not feel fierce like that .
And then Gogol said , with the absolute simplicity of a child --
Still Sunday said nothing , but only sat with his mighty chin upon his hand , and gazed at the distance .
" I never hated you ," said Syme very sadly .
" You !"
You are the police -- the great fat , smiling men in blue and buttons !
The only crime of the Government is that it governs .
I do not curse you ( though I might ) for being kind .
You sit in your chairs of stone , and have never come down from them .
Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe ?
I repel the slander ; we have not been happy .
I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused .
Syme felt a simple surprise when he saw rising all round him on both sides of the road the red , irregular buildings of Saffron Park .
He walked by instinct along one white road , on which early birds hopped and sang , and found himself outside a fenced garden .
Though poor I have lived honest , and I have brought you up to be the same , Mary ; and I am sure the little ones will take after you ; for you ' ll be good to them -- as good to them as you can ."
Edmund was not yet nine , but he was a stout - grown , healthy boy , and well disposed to work .
Her first care was to pay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her , for which she left money done up carefully in separate papers .
When all these were paid away , there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a year ' s schooling for herself and sisters which was due to the schoolmistress in a neighbouring village .
* The driver came to Mary about a week after her mother ' s death , and told her that the rent must be brought in the next day , and that she must leave the cabin , for a new tenant was coming into it ; that she was too young to have a house to herself , and that the only thing she had to do was to get some neighbour to take her and her brother and her sisters in for charity ' s sake .
The agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in there , upon her paying him half a guinea in hand , and promising to pay the same yearly .
Being now settled in their house , they went every day regularly to work ; Maud spun nine cuts a day , besides doing all that was to be done in the house ; Edmund got fourpence a day by his work ; and Peggy and Annie earned twopence apiece at the paper - mills near Navan , where they were employed to sort rags , and to cut them into small pieces .
Annie and Peggy cut out the garland , and Mary , when it was finished , went along with them and Edmund to put it up .
The children all stood still when they saw the two ladies passing near them ; but Mary did not know anybody was passing , for her face was hid in her hands .
Isabella and Caroline ( so these ladies were called ) would not disturb the poor children ; but they stopped in the village to inquire about them .
Edmund was out working with a farmer , Mary was spinning , and her little sisters were measuring out some bogberries , of which they had gathered a basketful , for sale .
At her leisure hours she taught her sisters to read and write ; and Edmund , with part of the money which he earned by his work out of doors , paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a little arithmetic .
A pound of common grease may be procured for fourpence , and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought for one shilling ; so that a pound of rushes , medicated and ready for use , will cost three shillings ."]
The servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance , and remembered it long after it was forgotten by Edmund .
He found that Edmund was both quick and exact in executing commissions .
So Edmund went into service at the vicarage ; and his master was the father of Isabella and Caroline .
He was mindful to do all that Mr . Gilbert required of him ; and he was so obliging to all his fellow - servants that they could not help liking him .
The young ladies , as soon as they had collected the money , walked to the old castle , where they found everything neat and clean as usual .
It was summer time , and he got up early , because he liked to go home to see his sisters , and he took his share in the manufactory .
She , however , in the midst of her hurry , found time to make a very pretty pair , with neat roses , as a present for her schoolmistress , who , now that she saw her pupil in a good way of business , consented to receive the amount of her old debt .
One begged Mary to let her plat some packthread for the soles ; another helped Peggy and Anne to baste in the linings ; and all who could get employment were pleased , for the idle ones were shoved out of the way .
The part of the castle in which they lived seemed , as Edmund said , to be perfectly safe ; but the children of the village were terrified , and thinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly , they ran to their homes as fast as they could .
Besides , she heard that several proposals had been made to Mr . Harvey for this house , and she knew that Mr . Hopkins , the agent , was not her friend ; therefore she despaired of getting it .
He offered to give a guinea yearly towards the rent out of his wages ; and Mr . Gilbert spoke about it for him to the steward , and inquired whether , amongst any of those who had given in proposals , there might not be one who would be content with a part of the house , and who would join with Mary in paying the rent .
She returned home to the old castle , mortified that she had no good news to tell Anne and Peggy , who she knew expected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village near their brother .
" And bad news for you , Mary ," replied her sisters , who looked very sorrowful .
" Many ' s the time ," said Mary , " that I have driven the poor thing away from that place ; I was always afraid she would shake that great ugly stone down upon her at last ."
" Here are more , a great many more of them ," cried Peggy ; and upon searching amongst the rubbish , they discovered a small iron pot , which seemed as if it had been filled with these coins , as a vast number of them were found about the spot where it fell .
This prophecy made a deep impression upon her .
*** Near Kells , in Ireland , there is a round tower , which was in imminent danger of being pulled down by an old woman ' s rooting at its foundation , in hopes of finding treasure .]
Mary told her that she had carried it to Mr . Hopkins , the agent .
" When good luck came to you , what a shame to turn your back upon it !
Mary was much alarmed , and not without reason , at this speech ; for she knew that if Goody Grope once set to work at the foundation of the old castle of Rossmore , she would soon bring it all down .
Mary paid the half - crown , and was in hopes that she had got rid for ever of her tormentor , but she was mistaken , for scarcely was the week at an end before the old woman appeared before her again , and repeated her threats of falling to work the next morning , unless she had something given to her to buy tobacco .
Mary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this unfortunate pot of gold coins .
Then Peggy exclaimed --" Sure !
" True ," said Mary ; " but is not it a hard case that we , who have lived , as my mother did all her life before us , in peace and honesty with all the world , should now have our good name taken from us , when --" Mary ' s voice faltered and stopped .
The orphans , conscious of their own innocence , took no pains about the matter ; and the consequence was , that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty ; but many , who knew nothing of them , concluded that the agent must be in the right and the children in the wrong .
She saw that she gained no belief , as her character was not known to this man , or to any of those who were present .
Still she exerted herself every day at her little manufacture ; and she endeavoured to console herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not give up her character , and who continued steadily to protect her and her sisters .
Isabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity of the orphans , but to prove it was in this instance out of their power .
The old castle , it was true , was likely to last through the winter , as the mason said ; but though the want of a comfortable house to live in was , a little while ago , the uppermost thing in Mary ' s thoughts , now it was not so .
let us in ," cried a voice , which she knew to be the voice of Betsy Green , the postmaster ' s daughter , who lived in the village near them .
Peggy and Anne were soon roused , when they heard that there was a letter from Edmund .
But I will not tell you how it all came about till we meet , which will be next week , as we are ( I mean , master and mistress , and the young ladies -- bless them !-- and Mr . Gilbert and I ) coming down to the vicarage to keep Christmas ; and a happy Christmas ' tis likely to be for honest folks .
So , till then , fare ye well , dear Mary , Nancy , and little Peg .
He was a Jew broker .
At first he refused to tell them from whom he got them , because he had bought them , he said , under a promise of secrecy .
and is not that the cause why they are going to live in a slated house now ?"
LAZY LAWRENCE .
She begged a few months ' delay , and they were granted to her ; but at the end of that time there was no resource but to sell her horse Lightfoot .
" Jem ," said the old woman , " what , ar ' t hungry ?"
" God bless the boy !
how he talks !-- Four mile there , and four mile back again , afore breakfast ."
He ' s to be -- sold !"
Why , must not I pay my debts honestly ; and must not I pay my rent , and was not it called for long and long ago ; and have not I had time ; and did not I promise to pay it for certain Monday fortnight , and am not I two guineas short ; and where am I to get two guineas ?
So what signifies talking , child ?"
Jem turned away struggling to hide his tears , and went to bed without saying a word more .
" If I get ever so little ," he still said to himself , " it will be SOMETHING ; and who knows but landlord might then wait a bit longer ?
But how to get the first penny was the question .
Jem was not , however , a boy to be easily discouraged ; he went to the rocks , and walked slowly along , looking at all the stones as he passed .
Presently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening some large rocks , and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking for something very eagerly ; Jem ran up , and asked if he could help him .
" Come ," said the man , " it ' s gone for ever ; don ' t trouble yourself any more , my boy ."
" One good turn deserves another ," said the man ; " we are going to dinner just now , and shall leave off work -- wait for me here , and I ' ll make it worth your while ."
cried Jem to him , when he saw him lying upon the grass ; " what , are you asleep ?"
" Nothing ."
He chose his place well , and waited nearly all the evening , offering his fossils with great assiduity to every passenger ; but not one person bought any .
cried some sailors , who had just rowed a boat to land , " bear a hand here , will you , my little fellow , and carry these parcels for us into yonder house ?"
The lady lived but a very little way off , so that they were soon at her house .
She was alone in her parlour , and was sorting a bundle of feathers of different colours ; they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a window seat , and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the table to show off his shells , he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard , and scattered all the feathers .
" Who ' s Lightfoot ?"
" But are you willing earnestly to work ?"
said the lady ; " you know there is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones , and working steadily every day , and all day long ."
Jem bowed , thanked her , and went away .
" Don ' t you ever go to part with it , do ye hear !"
" But ," argued the wife , " another penny would do just as well to buy gingerbread ; and that ' s what it will go for ."
" Never had so good a little boy about the grounds ," said the gardener ; " he ' s always at his work , let me come by when I will , and he has got twice as much done as another would do ; yes , twice as much , ma ' am ; for look here -- he began at this ' ere rose - bush , and now he ' s got to where you stand , ma ' am ; and here is the day ' s work that t ' other boy , and he ' s three years older too , did to - day -- I say , measure Jem ' s fairly , and it ' s twice as much , I ' m sure ."
Jem joined them , and was the merriest and most active amongst them ; till , at last , when quite out of breath with running , he was obliged to give up to rest himself , and sat down upon the stile , close to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was swinging .
" Tired of what ?"
" Follow me , then ," cried Jem , " and I ' ll soon make you believe me ; come ."
" Is it far ?"
well , I ' ve a great mind to work ; but then it ' s such hot weather , besides , grandmother says I ' m not strong enough yet for hard work ; and besides , I know how to coax daddy out of money when I want it , so I need not work .
" If I had four and sevenpence ," said he to himself , " I certainly should be happy !"
No , no ," catching hold of him , " I believe you can ' t move ; but I ' ll make you ."
The next day he saw the nuts again , and wishing for them more than ever , he went home , in hopes that his father , as he said to himself , would be in a better humour .
At these terrible words Lawrence burst into tears , and , going to the side of a ditch , sat down and cried for an hour ; and when he had cried till he could cry no more , he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets , to see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left ; and , to his great joy , in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found .
With this he proceeded to the fruit woman ' s stall .
She was busy weighing out some plums , so he was obliged to wait ; and whilst he was waiting he heard some people near him talking and laughing very loud .
He stood by watching them for a few minutes .
At first their shocking oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him ; for Lawrence , though lazy , had not yet learned to be a wicked boy .
But , by degrees , he was accustomed to the swearing and quarrelling , and took a delight and interest in their disputes and battles .
Here he found some relief from the insupportable fatigue of doing nothing , and here , hour after hour , with his elbows on his knees , and his head on his hands , he sat , the spectator of wickedness .
Jem , always active and obliging , readily stayed from play , and was carrying in a heavy flower pot , when his mistress crossed the hall .
" Thank ' e , ma ' am ," said Jem , making his best bow , for he thought by the lady ' s looks that she meant to do him a favour , though he repeated to himself , " Dispose of them , what does that mean ?"
In a fortnight he made eighteen .
But how his countenance changed !
the hat was heavy with shillings .
" Two guineas !"
said he , scarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company ; " will YOU thank ' em , for you know I don ' t know how to thank ' em RIGHTLY ."
" Now we won ' t keep you any longer , only ," said his mistress , " I have one thing to ask you , that I may be by when you show your treasure to your mother ."
Then turning his eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion , said , in a low voice , to Lawrence , " Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out ?"
" I don ' t know ," said Lawrence , " as to that ; but they say a cockfight ' s a fine sight , and it ' s no more cruel in me to go than another ; and a great many go , and I ' ve nothing else to do , so I shall go ."
I saw in the manger a hat full of silver ."
" But it is not stealing ; we don ' t mean to steal ; only to borrow it ; and if we win , which we certainly shall , at the cock - fight , pay it back again , and he ' ll never know anything about the matter , and what harm will it do him ?
But it is better that they should know the truth , and see what the idle boy came to at last .
" What do we stand here for ?"
said the stable boy , snatching the flower - pot out of Lawrence ' s trembling hands , and pulled him away from the door .
" Hold your tongue ," replied the other , walking on , deaf to all remonstrances --" if ever I am to be hanged , it sha ' n ' t be for half a crown ."
Trying to laugh , she added , " I knew how Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part .
The farmer had scarcely sat down when Jem , with a pale , wild countenance came back .
and , bursting into tears , he sobbed as if his little heart would break .
His mother listened to him with the greatest surprise , whilst his mistress stood in silence , looking first at the old woman , and then at Jem with a penetrating eye , as if she suspected the truth of his story , and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion .
" How came you to leave all your money in a broken flower - pot in the stable ?
How came you not to give it to your mother to take care of ?"
Still the lady , who had lived too long in the world to be without suspicion , maintained a cold manner , and determined to wait the event without interfering , saying only , that she hoped the money would be found , and advised Jem to have done crying .
In a minute or two Jem appeared , with a steady countenance , leading Lightfoot and , when he came up , without saying a word , put the bridle into Farmer Truck ' s hand .
" He HAS BEEN a good horse ," said the farmer .
" I forget ," said Jem ; " I think I have seen your face before , but I forget ."
" Do you so ?
" With them that you gave it to , I suppose ," said the milk - woman , turning away suddenly to take up her milk - pail .
said she , turning round to the old woman , " my Betty serves you , and she ' s a tight and stirring lassy , ma ' am , I can assure --"
" Yes , I don ' t doubt it ," said the lady , impatiently ; " but about the silver penny ?"
The lad took no notice ; but when he opened it , out it falls .
Still he takes no heed , but cuts the cord , as I said before , and through the gate they went , and out of sight in half a minute .
I picks up the penny , for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a long time , and had given against my voice to he ," pointing to Jem ; " and I charged him not to part with it ; and , ma ' am , when I looked I knew it by the mark , so I thought I would show it to HE ," again pointing to Jem , " and let him give it back to those it belongs to ."
" It belongs to me ," said Jem , " I never gave it to anybody -- but --"
" Oh , which way did they go ?"
cried Jem , " I ' ll run after them ."
Whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves , the lady , who was now thoroughly convinced of Jem ' s truth , desired her coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening .
" I WILL -- I tell you I WILL see the thief !"
" Lawrence !"
exclaimed the wretched father .
Lawrence fell on his knees , and in a voice that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the circumstances of his guilt .
" Such a young creature so wicked !"
the bystanders exclaimed ; " what could put such wickedness in your head ?"
" Bad company ," said Lawrence .
Nothing more was said ; for everybody felt the truth of the farmer ' s speech .
This hope was very delightful to Franklin , and he showed the strongest desire to learn and to do everything that was right ; so that Mr . Spencer soon grew fond of him , and took great pains to instruct him , and to give him all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful , respectable and happy man .
You will carry this letter to my sister , Mrs . Churchill , in Queen ' s Square .
" You must expect ," continued Mr . Spencer , " to meet with several disagreeable things , and a great deal of rough work , at your first setting out ; but be faithful and obedient to your mistress , and obliging to your fellow - servants , and all will go well .
Mrs . Churchill will make you a very good mistress , if you behave properly ; and I have no doubt but you will ."
" Thank you , sir ."
He got to Queen ' s Square about three o ' clock .
" I ' m sure I hope so too ," observed Mrs . Pomfret ; " but I can ' t say ; for my part , I ' ve no great notion of those low people .
" But they are not suffered to be with their parents ," rejoined the lady ; " and therefore cannot be hurt by their example .
" About her nephew , ma ' am ; the boy she and I was speaking to you for ."
" The day you called her up about the almond pudding , ma ' am .
" But I did not promise to take her nephew ."
said his mistress .
Felix became the favourite of Corkscrew ; and , though Franklin by no means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences , nor ever entered without knocking at the door , yet it was his fate once to be sent of a message at an unlucky time ; and , as the door was half open , he could not avoid seeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor , which he could not help suspecting to be wine ; and , as the decanter , which usually went upstairs after dinner , was at this time in the butler ' s grasp , without any stopper in it , he was involuntarily forced to suspect they were drinking his mistress ' wine .
Mrs . Pomfret , the housekeeper , had several times , directly and indirectly , given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late .
I knew the nature of him well enough , from the first time I ever set my eyes upon him ; but mistress shall have her own way , and see the end of it ."
These words , and the bitter sense of injustice , drew tears at length fast down the proud cheek of Franklin , which might possibly have touched Mrs . Pomfret , if Felix , with a sneer , had not called them CROCODILE TEARS .
" Very well ," said she .
" Call at the bookseller ' s in -- stay , I must write down the direction .
Manchon was extremely fond of Felix , who , by way of pleasing his mistress , had paid most assiduous court to her dog ; yet now his caresses were rather troublesome .
poor fellow !"
" My cold turkey , as I ' m alive !"
" What is all this ?"
said Mrs . Churchill , in a composed voice .
He was struck dumb .
The alehouse was kept by that cousin of Felix ' s , who was so fond of " DELICATE cold turkey ," and who had such choice cherry - brandy .
All these precautions taken , the butler was at liberty to indulge his favourite passion , which so increased with indulgence , that his wages were by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life .
To which the landlord coolly replied , " That as long as he had paid like a gentleman , he had been treated like one , and that was as much as anyone could expect , or , at any rate , as much as anyone would meet with in this world ."
His debt , his love of drinking , the impossibility of indulging it without a fresh supply of money , all came into his mind at once , and conquered his remaining scruples .
They required of him to give up the key of the house door , that they might get another made by it .
The cravats were bought and shown to Felix .
Franklin slept in the next room to him , and presently awaking , thought he perceived a strong smell of something burning .
repeated Felix , sneeringly ; " what , you MUST be a tell - tale !"
" No , I never told any tales of anybody , and I should be very sorry to get anyone into a scrape ; but for all that I shall not tell a lie , either for myself or anybody else , let you call me what names you will ."
" But if I were to give you something that you would like ," said Corkscrew --" something that I know you would like !"
In this hope he was mistaken ; for the first thing Mrs . Pomfret did in the morning was to come into the room to examine and deplore the burnt curtains , whilst Corkscrew stood by , endeavouring to exculpate himself by all the excuses he could invent .
He took up the candlestick ; but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it , she snatched it from his hands ; " How did this candlestick come here ?
" How do you find yourself this morning , ma ' am ?"
" Very sleepy , indeed ," answered her mistress in a drowsy voice ; " I think I must sleep half an hour longer -- shut the curtains ."
" As you please , ma ' am ; but I suppose I had better open a little of the window shutter , for it ' s past nine ."
" Put down the key , then , or you ' ll knock something else down ; and you may open the shutters now ; for I ' m quite awake ."
" I heard no noise ."
" To be sure , ma ' am , what I say IS , that , without the spirit of prophecy , one can nowadays account for what has passed .
I ' m quite clear in my own judgment , that Mr . Corkscrew must have been out last night after I went to bed ; for , besides the japanned candlestick , which of itself I ' m sure is strong enough to hang a man , there ' s another circumstance , ma ' am , that certifies it to me -- though I have not mentioned it , ma ' am , to no one yet ," lowering her voice --" Franklin , when I questioned him , told me , that he left the lantern in the outside porch in the court last night , and this morning it was on the kitchen table .
" And do you believe HIM ?"
" There ' s no occasion , I think , for trying him any more , ma ' am ," said Mrs . Pomfret , who was as violent in her likings as in her dislikes .
Thus stood affairs the night before Mrs . Churchill ' s birthday .
" How should you like to go to the play with me to - morrow ?"
" The key !"
cried Corkscrew , changing his tone ; " then , sir , I can ' t take you to the play ."
" Very well , sir ," said Felix , mimicking him , " you need not look so important , nor fancy yourself such a great man , because you ' re master of a key ."
Felix , you would have no objection , I suppose , to going to the play with me ?"
" No , but I can ' t oblige him in this ; for , as I told you before , my mistress trusted me .
" But we ' ll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy ," said Felix ; " and let him make his story good as he can afterwards .
Evening came , and after tea Mr . Spencer sent for Franklin upstairs .
" I don ' t think anything -- much , I mean , of that , sir ," answered Franklin , smiling .
" Yes ; half an hour ago , sir ."
When Mr . Spencer came to examine the pantry , he found the large salvers and cups in a basket behind the door , and the other things placed so as to be easily carried off .
and if here isn ' t Felix ' s fine cravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play !
" Nay , sir , but I won ' t pretend to sleep in the house , if Franklin isn ' t to have a blunderbuss , and I a BAGGONET ."
They looked so shocking !
But poor Franklin !
And , ma ' am ," continued Mrs . Pomfret , " the night after the fire I left him my great Bible and my watch , in my will ; for I never was more mistaken at the first in any boy in my born days ; but he has won me by his own DESERTS , and I shall from this time forth love all the VILLAINTROPIC folks for his sake ."
SIMPLE SUSAN .
The setting sun shone full upon the pink blossoms of the hawthorn , when the merry group assembled upon their little green .
" Tell her to make haste ," cried Philip .
She was detained by her father ' s returning later than usual .
His supper was ready for him nearly an hour before he came home ; and Susan swept up the ashes twice , and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze for him ; but at last , when he did come in , he took no notice of the blaze or of Susan ; and when his wife asked him how he did , he made no answer , but stood with his back to the fire , looking very gloomy .
Susan put his supper upon the table , and set his own chair for him ; but he pushed away the chair and turned from the table , saying --" I shall eat nothing , child !
She thanked him , and with that nimble alacrity which marks the desire to please , she ran to her neat chicken - yard ; but , alas !, her guinea - hen was not there -- it had strayed into the attorney ' s garden .
what damages ?"
I only want ONE for my father ' s supper ; you shall have all the rest ."
At the door of her father ' s cottage she saw her friend Rose , who was just come to summon her to the hawthorn bush .
" They are all at the hawthorn , and I am come for you .
When Rose , however , learnt that her friend ' s guinea - hen was detained prisoner by the attorney ' s daughter , she exclaimed , with all the honest warmth of indignation , and instantly ran back to tell the story to her companions .
So I was drawn for a militiaman ; but when I thought how loth you and I would be to part , I was main glad to hear that I could get off by paying eight or nine guineas for a substitute -- only I had not the nine guineas -- for , you know , we had bad luck with our sheep this year , and they died away one after another -- but that was no excuse , so I went to Attorney Case , and , with a power of difficulty , I got him to lend me the money ; for which , to be sure , I gave him something , and left my lease of our farm with him , as he insisted upon it , by way of security for the loan .
When she came a little to herself she sat up , begged that her husband would go on , and that nothing might be concealed from her .
said he .
The ground is a thing not worth talking of ; but it ' s neither yours nor mine .
You forgot the flaw in your lease , which I have safe in this desk ."
When Susan heard her father ' s story , she quite forgot her guinea - hen , and her whole soul was intent upon her poor mother , who , notwithstanding her utmost exertion , could not support herself under this sudden stroke of misfortune .
The rushlight , which stood beside the bed , was now burnt low ; the long shadow of the tall wicker chair flitted , faded , appeared , and vanished , as the flame rose and sunk in the socket .
She distinguished the merry voices of her companions " carolling in honour of the May ," and soon she saw them coming towards her father ' s cottage , with branches and garlands in their hands .
We sha ' n ' t hear your voices or the pipe when you have turned the corner into the village ; so you need only stop till then , Philip ."
" How grateful that child is to me , for a cowslip only !
said Susan to herself , as she bent over her sleeping mother ' s pale countenance .
She understood so readily , she obeyed so exactly ; and when she was left to her own discretion , judged so prudently , that her mother had little trouble and no anxiety in directing her .
said Rose .
" Better , thank you ."
See how generous they have been -- twelve shillings , I assure you .
The twelve shillings were spread upon the table .
Her generous little friends were amazed at Barbara ' s meanness , but with one accord declared that they were most willing , for their parts , to give up every farthing of the money .
They all went to Susan in a body , and told her so .
said Susan , starting from a reverie into which she had fallen , as she contemplated the purse .
" Certainly I DO long to see my pretty guinea - hen once more ; but I was not thinking of her just then -- I was thinking of my father ."
Let me come and help you to - morrow ," continued she , looking at Susan ' s work , " if you have any more mending work to do -- I never liked work till I worked with you .
The housekeeper , who had known Susan from a child , was pleased to have an opportunity in speaking in her favour .
" You have really said enough to excite my curiosity ," said her mistress ; " pray send for her immediately ; we can see her before we go out to walk ."
The modest simplicity of Susan ' s appearance and the artless propriety of the answers she gave to all the questions that were asked her , pleased the ladies at the Abbey , who were good judges of character and manners .
Bab could descend , without shame , whenever it suited her purposes , from the height of insolent pride to the lowest meanness of fawning familiarity .
" What room did you go into ?"
" Did you see Miss Somers , or Sir Arthur ?"
" La !
" Lord , her head is full of broth now ," said Bab to her maid ; " and she has not a word for herself , though she has been abroad .
For my part , I think she ' s little better than a downright simpleton .
Barbara followed Susan into the cottage , and found her occupied with the grand affair of the broth .
During this interval Bab employed herself , much to her own satisfaction , in cross - questioning Susan .
" Ay , that ' s as plain as a pike - staff ," said Barbara ; " but what else did she mean , think you ?
_I_ must taste it ," said Bab , taking the basin up greedily .
Barbara , who did not , like Susan , bear with her father ' s testy humour from affection and gentleness of disposition , but who always humoured him from artifice , tried all her skill to fathom his thoughts , and when she found that it would not do , she went to tell her maid so , and to complain that her father was so cross there was no bearing him .
Sir Arthur Somers , the NEW MAN , did not suit him , and he began to be rather apprehensive that he should not suit Sir Arthur .
This seemed to our attorney a contradiction in terms ; in the course of his practice the case had not occurred ; and he had no precedents ready to direct his proceedings .
In short , he had not yet decided whether he was an honest man or a knave .
" Neither in law nor equity ," repeated Sir Arthur , with apparent incredulity .
" A little ," said Sir Arthur .
" Why , then , that can be done away in a moment .
" No -- you have said enough ," replied Sir Arthur .
" There ' s only one thing we have forgotten all this time ," said Sir Arthur .
" That we shall ruin this poor man ."
Whom shall I apply to ?"
The tenants had been in the reluctant but constant practice of making him continual petty offerings ; and he resolved to try the same course with Sir Arthur , whose resolution to be his own agent , he thought , argued a close , saving , avaricious disposition .
" And if YOU could help it , Susan ?"
said he .
She started up in an ecstasy .
Are not sheep killed every day , and don ' t you eat mutton ?
" I shall not forget it ," said Susan , steadily .
" Susan !
said the poor woman , joining her hands .
She set to work , ruled her lines for the pounds , shillings and pence , made out the bill for the Abbey , and despatched the impatient messenger .
Here , look at the bill you were sending up to the Abbey ?
" How delighted he will be when he hears the good news !"
The close shaven green , which sloped down from the hatch - door of the schoolroom , was paled round with a rude paling , which , though decayed in some parts by time , was not in any place broken by violence .
" He must be very old , for all his hair is white ; and he must have travelled a great way , for his shoes are quite worn out ," observed another .
He turned his face eagerly to the place where she stood ; and it was observed , that whenever she said that she liked any tune particularly he played it over again .
" Oh , that ' s wrong -- you did not hear all that from herself , I ' m sure ," said John , " for nobody ever hears her praising herself ."
added he turning to his companion .
The little children shrunk back in timid silence , and eyed the brutal boy with dislike .
There were sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat .
" It never will do , sir ," persisted the lad ; " look at it yourself ; the edges are all yellow !
you can see the copper through it quite plain .
The little assembly , though under evident constraint , could no longer suppress their indignation .
" Yes , here ' s the butcher ' s boy ," said the attorney ' s son ; " show it to him ."
However , after some moments ' hesitation , and after turning the shilling round several times , he pronounced , " that , as far as his judgment went , but he did not pretend to be a downright CERTAIN SURE of it , the shilling was not over and above good ."
The old harper called to Susan , and begged , that , if she was going towards the village , she would be so kind as to show him the way .
They were now come to a gate , which opened upon the high road to the village .
She went in , and was rejoiced to see the shelves at the back of the counter well - furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs , and gay , neat printed linens and calicoes .
She was thinking much of her lamb , and more of her father .
Miss Somers had put a bright guinea into her hand , and had bid her pay for her own gown ; but Susan , as she looked at the guinea , thought it was a great deal of money to lay out upon herself , and she wished , but did know like to ask , that she might keep it for a better purpose .
Some people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings , and incapable of reading the countenances of those on whom they bestow their bounty .
" If you don ' t fancy any of these ," said the civil shopkeeper to Susan , " we shall have a new assortment of calicoes for the spring season , soon from town ."
But I don ' t speak from partiality ; for I am no relation whatever to the Prices -- only a well - wisher , as everyone , I believe , who knows them is .
" If that could but be done ," said she to herself , " how happy would my mother be .
but she would not have blessed Attorney Case , though , if she had known about my poor Daisy ."
" What did that good lady want with you ?"
said William .
said William , and he wept bitterly .
He struck his head against the low roof , as he stepped over the doorsill .
Of this he had just had experience at the house of the Attorney Case , while he had asked , but had been roughly refused all assistance by Miss Barbara , who was , according to her usual custom , standing staring at the hall door .
Who knows , dearest mother , but we may keep him with us for ever !"
Susan ' s father , as soon as supper was finished , even before he would let the harper play a tune for his boys , opened the little purse , which Susan had given him .
said he .
Here ' s twenty - nine shillings , and the Abbey bill , which is not paid yet , comes to ten more .
The prize was ten guineas for the best performer on the harp , and the prize was now to be decided in a few days .
Often had she sighed to be there , and often had she revolved in her mind schemes for introducing herself to some GENTEEL neighbours , who might take her to the ball IN THEIR CARRIAGE .
How rejoiced , how triumphant was she , when this very evening , just about the time when the butcher was bargaining with her father about Susan ' s lamb , a servant from the Abbey rapped at the door , and left a card for Mr . and Miss Barbara Case .
Who knows ?
The least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage , WHICH costs nothing , but is just a common civility , to a ball ."
I must have it to DINE IN , at the Abbey , or the ladies will think nothing of me ; and Betty , remember the mantua - maker too .
She left a portfolio of pretty drawings and good prints , for Miss Barbara ' s amusement ; but Miss Barbara ' s thoughts were so intent upon the harpers ' ball , that she could not be entertained with such TRIFLES .
Whilst Barbara was contriving means of interesting Miss Somers in her favour , she recollected , with surprise , that not one word had yet been said of her present of the guinea - hen .
She made no answer , in expectation that the housekeeper , who was a woman of a very open temper , would explain her cause of dissatisfaction .
The housekeeper came close up to the dressing table , and continued , " I never like to speak till I ' m sure , ma ' am , and I ' m not quite sure , to say certain , in this case , ma ' am , but still I think it right to tell you , which can ' t wrong anybody , what came across my mind about this same guinea - hen , ma ' am ; and you can inquire into it , and do as you please afterwards , ma ' am .
Dinner was now served .
Attorney Case expected to smell mint sauce , and , as the covers were taken from off the dishes , looked around for lamb ; but no lamb appeared .
After the ladies left the dining - room , as they were walking up and down the large hall , Miss Barbara had a fair opportunity of imitating her keen father ' s method of conversing .
said Miss Somers to her companions ; " I have a pretty guinea - hen to show you ."
He thanked her : but in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of the guinea - hen , and he involuntarily exclaimed , " Susan ' s guinea - hen , I declare !"
He recollected Rose and her generous friendship for Susan .
my father has something to say to you ."
" It is Daisy !"
These poor brute beasts don ' t know aforehand what ' s going to happen to them ; and as for dying , it ' s what we must all do some time or another ; but to keep wringing the hearts of the living , that have as much sense as one ' s self , is what I call cruel ; and is not this what Attorney Case has been doing by poor Susan and her whole family , ever since he took a spite against them ?
Come on !"
As Susan pronounced these words , a voice behind the little listening crowd cried , in a brutal tone , " Let us pass , if you please ; you have no right to stop up the public road !"
Now I ' ve my pretty guinea - hen safe once more , I should think of returning your money ."
no !
no !"
I WILL keep your money for my father .
Perhaps some time or other I may be able to earn --"
When this operation was successfully performed , which it certainly could never have been if Philip had not held the hen for Susan , he recollected that his mother had sent him with a message to Mrs . Price .
Miss Barbara , in the course of this day , felt considerable mortification , but no contrition .
As papa says , it ' s a good thing to have two strings to one ' s bow ."
Upon the faith of this promise , and with the vain hope that , by civility , they might dispose him to bring in a REASONABLE bill of costs , these officers sometimes invited Mr . Case to the mess ; and one of them , who had lately been married , prevailed upon his bride SOMETIMES to take a little notice of Miss Barbara .
They are going out on a party , somewhere into the country , and breakfast here on their way .
" But , surely ," said Bab , " we can contrive to get some honey in the neighbourhood ."
" There ' s none to be bought , as I know of ," said Betty .
Strathspey ."
You know , on a particular occasion such as this , neighbours must help one another ."
" To be sure they should ," added Betty .
" I ' ll tell you what , Susan Price ," said she , in a high tone , " the honey I WILL have , so you may as well give it to me by fair means .
" Can ' t you ?"
Bab grasped , but at her first effort she only reached the rosemary .
But instead of standing quietly , Bab buffeted and stamped and roared , and the bees stung her terribly .
Mr . Case had revolved things in his mind ; for his second visit at the Abbey pleased him as little as his first , owing to a few words which Sir Arthur and Miss Somers dropped in speaking of Susan and Farmer Price .
come downstairs , child , and speak to Susan Price ."
The silence was followed by a universal buzz of applause .
The judges were unanimous in their opinions , and it was declared that the old blind harper , who played the last , deserved the prize .
The simple , pathetic air which won the suffrages of the whole assembly , was his own composition .
He was pressed to give the words belonging to the music ; and at last he modestly offered to repeat them , as he could not see to write .
He was but just in time , for the postman ' s horn was sounding .
" But it is not April , it is May , father ," said Susan .
Your hospitality to me has afforded to me an opportunity of learning some of your family history .
You have not , I know , yet made up the full sum for your substitute , John Simpson ; therefore do me the favour to use the five guinea bank note which you will find within the ballad .
All I understand is the common honesty of the matter .
I ' ve no more to say ."
" This attorney , whom you speak of so often ," said Sir Arthur , " you seem to have some quarrel with .
" The matter between us , then ," said Price , " is a little bit of ground , not worth much , that is there open to the lane at the end of Mr . Case ' s garden , sir , and he wanted to take it in .
" Let us go and see this nook ," said Sir Arthur .
This piece of ground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road , and it was cut off when the lane was made ."
" Very possibly .
" Heaven forbid , sir ," said the attorney , sanctifying his face , " that I should suggest the taking an UNFAIR advantage of any man , rich or poor ; but to break a bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage ."
" Here it is .
" But I mean to do more than PAY YOU WITH WORDS ," said Sir Arthur .
" I know she did not keep that guinea for herself ," said Miss Somers .
Tell Rose to come to the Abbey , to - morrow morning , or , rather , come with her yourself ; for our housekeeper , I know , wants to talk to you about a certain cake .
" The words are something , but the tune -- the tune -- I must have the tune ," cried Philip .
" Yes ," cried the triumphant Philip , " I tell you it ' s all true , every word of it .
Mr . Somerville , to whom this town belongs , wished to inspire his tenantry with a taste for order and domestic happiness , and took every means in his power to encourage industrious , well behaved people to settle in his neighbourhood .
Was not it fifteen guineas I mentioned in my proposal ?
I ' d fight him here in your honour ' s presence , if he ' d only come out this minute , and meet me like a man ."
Here Mr . Cox put himself into a boxing attitude , but observing that Mr . Somerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile , and that several people , who had gathered round him as he stood in the street , laughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition , he changed his attitude , and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of drinking .
Not a drop of whisky , good or bad , have I touched these six months , except what I took with Jemmy M ' Doole the night I had the misfortune to meet your honour coming home from the fair of Ballynagrish ."
To this speech Mr . Somerville made no answer , but turned away to look at the bow window of a handsome new inn , which the glazier was at this instant glazing .
" Well , God bless your honour ; I ' ve no more to say , but God bless your honour ," said Mr . Cox ; and he walked away , muttering to himself , as he slouched his hat over his face , " I hope I ' ll live to be revenged on him !"
There ' s he that has done all the damage to our bow - window -- that ' s the very same wicked white pigeon that broke the church windows last Sunday was se ' nnight ; but he ' s down for it now ; we have him safe , and I ' ll chop his head off , as he deserves , this minute ."
I am persuaded by your open , honest countenance , that you are speaking the truth ; but pray explain this matter to us ; for you have not made it quite clear .
and how came you to find it out at last ?"
Here ' s one of his white feathers sticking in the gap ."
" Take the pigeon , my honest , generous lad ," said Mr . Somerville , " and carry him back to your neighbour .
Good morning to you , sir ; and thank you kindly ," said he to Mr . Somerville .
" They are but just come into the town , please your honour ," said the carpenter .
" This is an excellent character of the boy , indeed ," said Mr . Somerville , " and from his behaviour this morning I am inclined to think that he deserves all your praises ."
He always took care to scatter some oats for it in his father ' s yard ; and the pigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen , and eat off the same trencher with the dog .
Brian , after the shop was shut up at night , used to amuse himself with reading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him arithmetic was so good as to lend him .
" So , Brian , I see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you ; you like your book , I see , when you have no master over you to bid you read ," said his father , when he came in and saw Brian reading his book very attentively .
Brian never neglected the shop ; but in his leisure hours he amused himself with training his pigeon ; and after much patience he at last succeeded so well , that one day he went to his father and offered to send him word by his pigeon what beef was a pound in the market of Ballynagrish , where he was going .
" The pigeon will be home long before me , father ; and he will come in at the kitchen window , and light upon the dresser ; then you must untie the little note which I shall have tied under his left wing , and you ' ll know the price of beef directly ."
Another said , " No ."
" If we can ' t have it by fair means , we will by foul ," said Cox ; and a few days afterwards the pigeon was gone .
Brian searched for it in vain -- inquired from all the neighbours if they had seen it , and applied , but to no purpose , to Cox .
He swore that he knew nothing about the matter .
They loosed him from a bag near the town of Ballynagrish in hopes that he would stop at the house of Cox ' s cousin , which was on its road between Ballynagrish and Somerville .
At this instant the pigeon spread his wings , and Brian discovered under one of its wings a small and very dirty looking billet .
The scrawl was scarcely legible ; but these words were at length deciphered :--
Will you , my good lad ," continued Mr . Somerville , after a moment ' s pause --" will you trust me with your pigeon a few days ?"
The boy pulled off the cover , and saw a white pigeon painted upon the sign , and the name of O ' Neill in large letters underneath .
" Take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful occasion ," said Mr . Somerville , who saw that Brian ' s surprise was too great for his situation .
" No , I don ' t remember ."
I can easily believe that she is happy whilst she is eating a mince pie , or whilst she is playing ; but how does everybody ' s drinking her health at dinner make her happy ?"
Now you shall be judge , mamma ; I ' ll tell you all that was in the drawer ."
Rosamond thought , but she could not find out any reason ; besides , she suddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer ; for there was a certain work - basket to be finished , which she was making for her cousin Bell , as a present upon her birthday .
" Dear !
I hope she ' ll be by when I give my basket to Bell -- won ' t it be beautiful ?
Whilst she was gone , a footman in a livery , laced with silver , who belonged to the coach that stood at the shop door , as he was lounging with one of his companions , chanced to spy the weaving pillow , which she had left upon a stone before the door .
To divert himself ( for idle people do mischief often to divert themselves ) he took up the pillow , and entangled all the bobbins .
She got up gently , and was retiring into the house , when the silver laced footman stopped her , saying , insolently , " Sit still , child ."
At this instant her mother said to Rosamond --" Come , now , my dear , if you want this filigree paper , buy it ."
Satisfied with bestowing another exclamation upon the " Poor little girl !"
said Laura .
" Indeed , sir , you will spoil the poor handle ."
" But what is the use of THE POOR HANDLE ," said her father , " if we are not to take hold of it ?
" But you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her ."
And will you , or can you , or should you , always give , merely because others EXPECT , or because somebody else gives ?"
" That is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to answer .
said she looking up at last .
On her birthday she expected , however , to be perfectly happy .
The cause of five of these fits no one could discover : but the last , and most lamentable , was occasioned by a disappointment about a worked muslin frock ; and accordingly , at dressing time , her maid brought it to her , exclaiming , " See here , miss , what your mamma has sent you on your birthday .
" Oh , no , you must not touch it ; for if you should spoil it , what would become of me ?"
what signifies that -- I sha ' n ' t spoil it ; and I will have it in my own hands .
A struggle ensued , in which the handle and lid were torn off , and one of the medallions crushed inwards , before the little fury returned to her senses .
We hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to reflect .
The habits of tyranny , meanness , and falsehood , which children acquire from living with bad servants , are scarcely ever conquered in the whole course of their future lives .
The girl was going to answer , but the maid interrupted her , saying --" Come , come , none of your excuses ; you are a little idle , good - for - nothing thing , to disappoint Miss Bell upon her birthday .
Call again !
Till at length she was no longer able to conceal her impatience , and turning to Laura , who sat next to her , she said , " You have no lace upon your cuffs .
" No , indeed ," said Laura , smiling .
" Oh !
" Your beautiful lace , my dear love -- do you know how much it cost ?"
Miss Laura , I am sure , did not mean any such thing ."
Rosamond , followed by all the company , amongst whom , to her great joy , was her godmother , proceeded to the dressing room .
was all that Rosamond could say .
cried Bell , furiously ; " Mamma , mamma !
Miss Rosamond ' s charming present must not be spoiled in this way , in my house , without my taking proper notice of it .
Rosamond did not rejoice in her anger , and had nearly made a sad mistake by speaking aloud her thoughts --" I WAS VERY FOOLISH --" she began and stopped .
" Who ?"
The girl came in with a look of simplicity ; but when she saw a room full of company she was a little abashed .
And , pray , how came you to see it ?
" Why , how could you see through the doors of my wardrobe ?"
" I saw it , madam , in her hands ," looking at the maid ; " and --"
" Ma ' am "-- hesitating --" miss pulled , and by accident -- I believe , I saw , ma ' am -- miss , you know what I saw ."
" Bell !
" You are too PRUDENT to throw away your money like your sister .
" The half - guinea , Laura !"
" Yes , Rosamond ," said her father , and he kissed her ; " this IS being really generous .
" Nay , you must decide that yourself , Rosamond ."
" The King and Royal Family were stopped on Eton Bridge by Messrs . Young and Mansfield , the Salt Bearers , to whom their Majesties delivered their customary donation of fifty guineas each .
" At Salt Hill , his Majesty , with his usual affability , took upon himself to arrange the procession round the Royal carriages ; and even when the horses were taken off , with the assistance of the Duke of Kent , fastened the traces round the pole of the coaches , to prevent any inconvenience .
" After the young gentlemen walked round the carriage , Ensign Vince and the Salt Bearers proceeded to the summit of the hill ; but the wind being boisterous , he could not exhibit his dexterity in displaying his flag , and the space being too small before the carriages , from the concourse of spectators , the King kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under such inconvenience .
" Their Majesties and the Princesses then returned home , the King occasionally stopping to converse with the Dean of Windsor , the Earl of Harrington , and other noblemen .
" Mr . Bradith , Colonel .
" Mr . Keity , yellow and black velvet ; helmet trimmed with silver .
The captain then paid his respects to the Royal Family , at the Queen ' s Lodge , Windsor , previously to his departure for King ' s College , Cambridge , to defray which expense the produce of the Montem was presented to him .
" The day concluded by a brilliant promenade of beauty , rank , and fashion , on Windsor Terrace , enlivened by the performance of several bands of music .
" After the dissolution of the alien priories , in 1414 , by the Parliament of Leicester , they remained in the Crown till Henry VI ., who gave Wrotham Manor to Eton College ; and if the Eton Fellows would search , they would perhaps find the Manor in their possession , that was held by the custom of Salt ."

Now that same wild Irishman has as much gratitude in him as any tame Englishman of them all .
Never fear !
Talb .
Yes , but too warm a friend is as bad as a bitter enemy .
I ' m as cool as a cucumber all the time ; and whilst they tink I ' m tinking of nothing in life but making a noise , I make my own snug little remarks in prose and verse , as -- now my voice is after coming back to me , you shall hear , if you plase .
There ' s a stroke , in the first place , for Wheeler ,-- you take it ?
Talb .
Rory .
Sure ' twas none of I made it --' twas Talbot here .
Talb .
I !
" Then there ' s he with the purse that ' s as long as my arm ; His father ' s a tanner ,-- but then where ' s the harm ?
Heir to houses , and hunters , and horseponds in fee , Won ' t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree ?
Talb .
Mr . Talbot , Lord John thanks you .
Rory .
( puts him aside and continues speaking to Talbot ).
Lord John thanks you , Mr . Talbot : this is the second part of the caricature .
My Lord John , Talbot ' s writing the song was all a mistake .
Just as much .
He did not waste a word of it ; upon my conscience , I wrote it all -- though I ' ll engage you didn ' t think I could write a good thing .
( Lord John turns away .)
You will excuse me , sir , if I cannot believe two contradictory assertions within two minutes .
Wheeler !
huzza !
Oh , the scale may turn back again .
it ' s all my doing .
( Exit .)
Wheel .
ha !
ha !
( Aside ).
he !
A fig for your word and honour .
Bursal , of no consequence !
Why , everybody that knows anything -- everybody that has seen Bursal House -- knows that you are of the greatest consequence , my dear Bursal .
( Strikes his repeater .)
Happy dog as you are !
But I am not of half so much consequence as Lord John -- am I ?
Wheel .
You purse - proud !
Burs .
Well , this Wheeler does put one into a good humour with one ' s self in spite of one ' s teeth .
( Aloud .)
Talbot says blunt things ; but I don ' t think he ' s what you can call clever -- hey , Wheeler ?
Clever ?
Burs .
Is not it true , Jack ?
ha !
Wheel .
Not so dead either ; for there ' s a great independent party , you know ; and if YOU don ' t help me , Bursal , to canvass them , I shall be no captain .
Will you come and canvass them with me ?
In the back scene a flock of sheep are seen penned .
In front , a party of country lads and lasses , gaily dressed , as in sheep - shearing time , with ribands and garlands of flowers , etc ., are dancing and singing .
The dancers break off when she comes in , and direct their attention towards her .
That ' s the young gentleman who pulled my lamb out of the ditch for me , into which he had fallen -- pretty creature !
I should , at your age , ay , or at my age , just the self - same way have been frightened myself , if so be that mention had been made to me , that way , of my own mother ' s having broke her leg or so .

I tell you it was this time last year , man , that I was mounted upon a fine bay hunter , out a - hunting .
I ' ll not tell you that I am an impertinent little jackanapes !
Now , if he had but a - spoke me fair , I would not have gainsaid him : but he falls to swearing , so I bid him open the gate for himself .
( Aloud .)
Will you come with me , then , and you ' ll do me some guineas ' worth of service ?
Where am I ?
Miss B .
No , indeed , ma ' am ; I never BE ' S at the doors .
But , my dear Miss Bursal , if I may be so bold -- if you ' d only disembosom your mind of what ' s on it --
I ' ve nothing on my mind .
Miss B . Hush !
Hush !
( going ).
And the ponies , and the curricle , and the vis - a - vis -- what will become of them ?
You can do very well without me .
You know Mr . Finsbury will be here just now , with the dresses ; and we have to try them on .
Burs .
Wheugh !
Wheeler , the principal ' s nothing without the interest .
Why , you ' d best be my tutor , Wheeler !-- a devilish good thought .

Oh , what a pity I ' m in mourning .
We are to be the eight servitors .

Your lordship will remember your lordship ' s promise .
Come on , man , and don ' t stand begging pardon there , or I ' ll leave you .
Manent LORD JOHN and RORY O ' RYAN .
If I was going to be hanged , for the life of me I couldn ' t be after begging so many pardons for nothing at all .
True game to the last !
Lord J .
Is there any truth , then , my lord , in the report that is going about this hour past , that you have gone in a huff , and given your promise there to that sneaking Wheeler to vote for him now ?
Rory ( holding him ).
I ' m very often mad myself , and I would not give a potato for one that had never been mad in his life .
Well , one comfort is , my lord , as you ' re a bit of a scholar , we have the Latin proverb in our favour --" Ira furor brevis est " ( Anger is short madness ).
Not he , ' faith ; he ' d send me to Coventry , or , maybe , to a worse place , did he but know I was condescending to make this bit of explanation , unknown to him .
And I have given my promise to vote against him .
( Exit Rory .)
Lord J .
But what can have become of Talbot ?
Why , he ' ll have no objection to that -- hey , Wheeler ?
O , Bursal , pay him , and I ' ll pay you tomorrow .
Now , if you weren ' t to be captain after all , Wheeler , what a pretty figure you ' d cut .
( Aside .)
Who has paid , and who has not paid , I say ?
Burs .
Several Boys exclaim .
6th Boy .
March !
Rory .
You will be kind enough to LAVE Mr . Talbot ' s dress with me , Mr . Finsbury , for I ' m a friend .
Indubitably , sir : but the misfortune is -- he !
An honest farmer , and a good natured landlord , who would come here along with me to speak --
But I am so hot -- so short - winded , that ( panting and puffing )-- that for the soul and body of me , I cannot say what I have got for to say .
Rory .
Wheel .
( squeezing up to Talbot , aside ).
( To the Landlord .)
Land .
I suppose he paid the gentleman for the horse , or will do so , in good time .
( striking his stick on the floor ).
Why , sir , I was a - going to tell you the shabbiness -- why , sir , he did not pay the landlord , here , for the horse ; but he goes and says to the landlord , here --" Mr . Talbot had your horse on the self - same day ; ' twas he did the damage ; ' tis from he you must get your money ."
Ay , that I will -- I say ( very loudly ) I say I saw him there ( pointing to Wheeler ) take the jump which strained the horse ; and I ' m ready to swear to it .
I would not lose such a friend for all the songs in the world .
SCENE IV .
Louisa , I wish you would let me show it to mamma .
( Whilst Lady P . looks at the drawing , Violetta says to Louisa )
Louisa .
Yes , in earnest ,-- quite in earnest , my dear .
Louisa .
Violet .
( runs to her mother ).
Violet .
( Aside to her mother .)
I have the pleasure to tell you that you are misinformed -- it was the Airly Castle that was wrecked .
( Here Violetta interrupts , to ask her mother for her nosegay -- Lady P . gives it to her , then goes on speaking .)
When I told him she was lost , I thought he would have dropped down .
behind the scenes .)
How d ' ye do , mother !
Miss Talbot , I give you joy .
Rory .
Huzza !
Talb .
Set him down ?
No such TING !
There ' s nothing like a good loud huzza in this world .
said he .
" It is very safe , you see ; but we have not had time to pack it yet .
The peas rolled to all parts of the shop ; the impatient man swore at them , but Maurice , without being out of humour , set about collecting them as fast as possible .
" I am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore , and I ' ve business enough on my hands ."
The captain pushed forward towards the shop door .
" You seem , by the quantity of seeds you have got , to belong to a gardener .
Arthur !
" I know where you are ," continued Maurice , " and I ' m coming to you as fast as the raspberry - bushes will let me .
I shall see all your yellow flowers withered tomorrow ; but it is done , and it cannot be helped ; so , Arthur , let us say no more about it ."
Look what I have got for you ."
Then he told Arthur the story of the captain of the ship , and the china jar ; the seeds having been thrown down , and of the fine tulip - roots which had been given to him ; and Maurice concluded by offering one of the precious roots to Arthur , who thanked him with great joy , and repeatedly said , " How good you were not to be angry with me for breaking your bell - glass !
You are always poring over some book or another when a man comes to see you , which is not , according to my notions ( being a plain , UNLARNED Englishman bred and born ), so civil and neighbourly as might be ."
" Thank ye , neighbour , kindly ; the larches are coming on tolerably well , that ' s certain ; and here ' s to your good health , Mr . Grant -- you and yours , not forgetting your , what dye call ' em raspberries "--( drinks )-- and , after a pause , resumes , " I ' m not apt to be a beggar , neighbour , but if you could give me --"
He was going to have asked for some of the Brobdingnag raspberry - plants .
The next day the thought of the raspberry - plants recurred to his memory , but being a bashful man , he did not like to go himself on purpose to make his request , and he desired his wife , who was just setting out to market , to call at Grant ' s gate , and , if he was at work in his garden , to ask him for a few plants of his raspberries .
Is there no other boy , simpleton , think you , to play with , but this Scotchman ' s son !
" That ' s not all , father ," said Arthur , trying to stop himself from sobbing ; " but the thing is , I shall never have such another play - fellow ,- - I shall never have such another friend as Maurice Grant ."
Arthur promised to obey his father .
He only begged that he might once more speak to Maurice , and tell him that it was by his father ' s orders he acted .
Grant gave his answer to his wife ; she to a Welsh servant - girl , who did not perfectly comprehend her mistress ' broad Scotch ; and she in her turn could not make herself intelligible to Mrs . Oakly , who hated the Welsh accent , and whose attention , when the servant - girl delivered the message , was principally engrossed by the management of her own horse .
Oakly thought the plum - tree , as it belonged to Mr . Grant , had no right to make its appearance on his ground : an attorney told him that he might oblige Grant to cut it down ; but Mr . Grant refused to cut down his plum - tree at the attorney ' s desire , and the attorney persuaded Oakly to go to law about the business , and the lawsuit went on for some months .
" I fancy , father ," said he , " those things are for you , for there is a little note directed to you , in Maurice ' s handwriting .
So , wishing your Brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours , and longing to be all friends again , I am , with love to dear Arthur and self , " Your affectionate neighbour ' s son , " MAURICE GRANT .
" P . S .-- It is now about four months since the quarrel began , and that is a very long while ."
What are you reading there ?"
( Monthly Magazine , Dec . ' 98 , p .
" There is a sort of strawberry cultivated at Jersey , which is almost covered with seaweed in the winter , in like manner as many plants in England are with litter from the stable .
Although this may be attributed to these islands being surrounded with a salt , and consequently a moist atmosphere , yet the ashes ( seaweed ashes ) made use of as manure , may also have their portion of influence .
Perhaps this was the thing that has made you so angry with us all ; for you never have come to see father since that evening .
Mr . Oakly was much pleased by this openness , and said , " Why now , Arthur , this is something like , this is telling one the thing one wants to know , without fine speeches .
" Nothing in the world ; and he gave it to me just at the time when he had good cause to be angry with me , just when I had broken his bell - glass ."
I never , in the course of all my practice , met with anything better .
They know -- that is , Mr . Grant , who is sharp enough , knows -- that he will be worsted in that suit ; that he must , in short , pay you a good round sum for damages , if it goes on --"
" Damages !"
Forgive and forget ."
As he examined it from day to day , and every day thought it improving , he longed to thank his friend Maurice for it ; and he often mounted into his crab - tree , to look into Maurice ' s garden , in hopes of seeing his tulip also in full bloom and beauty .
The day of the florist ' s feast arrived , and Oakly went with his son and the fine tulip to the place of meeting .
To the owner of this tulip the prize was adjudged ; and , as the handsome garden - tools were delivered to Arthur , he heard a well known voice wish him joy .
" So I did ," said Maurice ; " but somebody ( I suppose by accident ) broke it ."
He was fond of children ; and as he had no sons , he determined to adopt one of his relations .
He had two nephews , and he invited both of them to his house , that he might have an opportunity of judging of their dispositions , and of the habits which they had acquired .
Benjamin , on the contrary , had been taught habits of care and foresight .
" No , sir , nothing !"
why , how did you get yours undone , man ?
said Hal , " what signifies a bit of packthread ?"
" It is whip cord ," said Ben .
A few days after this , Mr . Gresham gave to each of his nephews a new top .
" I ' ll manage to do without one ," said Hal , and he took the string of his hat for his top .
It happened some time afterwards that a lady , who had been intimately acquainted with Hal ' s mother at Bath -- that is to say , who had frequently met her at the card - table during the winter -- now arrived at Clifton .
She was informed by his mother that Hal was at Mr . Gresham ' s , and her sons , who were FRIENDS of his , came to see him , and invited him to spend the next day with them .
Besides this , he had been educated to think it was a fine thing to visit fine people ; and Lady Diana Sweepstakes ( for that was the name of his mother ' s acquaintance ) was a very fine lady , and her two sons intended to be very great gentlemen .
He had diverted himself with running up and downstairs , whipping the bannisters with it , as he thought he could convert it to no better use ; and , with his usual carelessness , he at last left it hanging just where he happened to throw it when the dinner bell rang .
" That ' s right , Ben ; never be ashamed of being good - natured to those who are younger and weaker than yourself ," said his uncle , smiling at seeing him produce his whip cord , to indulge his little cousin with a game at her favourite cat ' s cradle .
we boys are to have our turn , and Lady Di is to give a prize to the best marksman amongst us , of a very handsome bow and arrow !
" Why MUST he ?"
said Mr . Gresham .
" Why , sir , because everybody has -- I mean everybody that ' s anybody ; and Lady Diana was talking about the uniform all dinner time , and it ' s settled , all about it , except the buttons : the young Sweepstakes are to get theirs made first for patterns -- they are to be white , faced with green , and they ' ll look very handsome , I ' m sure ; and I shall write to mamma to - night , as Lady Diana bid me , about mine ; and I shall tell her to be sure to answer my letter , without fail , by return of post ; and then , if mamma makes no objection , which I know she won ' t , because she never thinks much about expense , and ALL THAT -- then I shall bespeak my uniform , and get it made by the same tailor that makes for Lady Diana and the young Sweepstakes ."
said Mr . Gresham , who was almost stunned by the rapid vociferation with which this long speech about a uniform was pronounced .
exclaimed Hal , with amazement painted in his countenance .
" Nay , did not you say , just now , you would give poor Ben a uniform ?"
" And that to be sure you will ; won ' t you ?
The name of Lady Diana Sweepstakes , Hal thought , must impress all present with respect ; he was highly astonished , when , as he looked round , he saw a smile of contempt upon everyone ' s countenance : and he was yet further bewildered , when he heard her spoken of as a very silly , extravagant , ridiculous woman , whose opinion no prudent person would ask upon any subject , and whose example was to be shunned , instead of being imitated .
To all this Mr . Gresham made no reply , and longer had the young gentleman expatiated upon the subject , which had so strongly seized upon his imagination , had not his senses been forcibly assailed at this instant by the delicious odours and tempting sight of certain cakes and jellies in a pastrycook ' s shop .
" I ' m beginning to be exceeding tired or sick or something ," said Hal ; " and as there is a stand of coaches somewhere hereabouts , had not we better take a coach , instead of walking all the way to Bristol ?"
" THE CATHEDRAL !"
There was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in Hal ' s countenance as he pronounced these words , like one wakening from a dream , which made both his uncle and his cousin burst out a - laughing .
He looked at the large stained figures on the Gothic window , and he observed their coloured shadows on the floor and walls .
we shall be late indeed ," said Hal ; " surely you ' ve looked long enough , Ben , at this blue and red window ."
* Vide " Priestley ' s History of Vision ," chapter on coloured shadows .
cried Ben , " did you hear that noise ?"
" And ," continued the lad who showed the cathedral , " he has lived here these many , many winters .
The lad crumbled the bun , and called to the robin , who fluttered and chirped , and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread ; but yet he did not come down from his pinnacle on the organ .
Time was he ' d have come down for me before ever so many fine folks , and have eat his crumbs out of my hand , at my first call ; but , poor fellow !
" Where does your mother live ?"
said Ben , when they went out of the cathedral .
They went into the house ; it was rather a hovel than a house ; but , poor as it was , it was as neat as misery could make it .
The old woman was sitting up in her wretched bed , winding worsted ; four meagre , ill - clothed , pale children were all busy , some of them sticking pins in paper for the pin - maker , and others sorting rags for the paper - maker .
" What a horrid place it is !"
I ' ve often seen terrible - looking , tumble - down places , as we drove through the town in mamma ' s carriage ; but then I did not know who lived in them ; and I never saw the inside of any of them .
I had half a crown ; but ," continued he , feeling in his pockets , " I ' m afraid I spent the last shilling of it this morning upon those cakes that made me sick .
I have a very good coat , and I think it would be waste ."
" Well , let me get out of the carriage , and we will see about it ," said Mr . Gresham ; " perhaps the sight of the beautiful green and white cloth , and the epaulettes ( have you ever considered the epaulettes ?)
" Then , by this calculation , I find I could , for less than half the money your uniforms would cost , purchase for each of you boys a warm great - coat , which you will want , I have a notion , this winter upon the Downs ."
We sha ' n ' t want greatcoats YET ."
" Don ' t you remember how cold we were , Hal , the day before yesterday , in that sharp wind , when we were flying our kite upon the Downs ?
" Well , then , thank you , sir ," said Hal ; " I think I had better have the uniform , because , if I have not the uniform , now , directly , it will be of no use to me , as the archery meeting is the week after next , you know ; and , as to the great - coat , perhaps between this time and the VERY cold weather , which , perhaps , won ' t be till Christmas , papa will buy a great - coat for me ; and I ' ll ask mamma to give me some pocket money to give away , and she will , perhaps ."
" I always believed ," said Mr . Gresham , shaking hands with Ben , " that economy and generosity were the best friends , instead of being enemies , as some silly , extravagant people would have us think them .
You say famous very often ; and I don ' t know exactly what it means ; a famous uniform -- famous doings .
How do you do ?
" I am not a very good judge of sewing , my dear little girl ," said Mr . Gresham , examining the work with a close and scrupulous eye ; " but , in my opinion , here is one stitch that is rather too long .
" How much better he looks than he did in the ragged coat !
" They are but poor things , sir , she bid me say , to look at ; but , considering she has but one hand to work with , and that her left hand , you ' ll not despise ' em , we hopes ."
" The Master Sweepstakes , sir ," said Stephen , " are come for Master Hal .
Uniform , if you mean to go ," said Mr . Gresham .
Ben discovered this when he went to fetch his own ; and the lad from Bristol , who had been ordered by Mr . Gresham to eat his breakfast before he proceeded to Redland Chapel , heard Ben talking about his cousin ' s bow and arrows .
I shall be much obliged to you ," said Ben ; and away went the boy with the bow that was ornamented with green ribands .
A little band of children , who had been mustered by Lady Diana Sweepstakes ' SPIRITED EXERTIONS , closed the procession .
They were now all in readiness .
The drummer only waited for her ladyship ' s signal ; and the archers ' corps only waited for her ladyship ' s word of command to march .
He looked from side to side in great distress --" Oh , there ' s my bow coming , I declare !"
The drum beat , the fife played , the archers marched , the spectators admired .
The walk appeared much shorter than usual , and he was extremely sorry that Lady Diana , when they were half - way up the hill leading to Prince ' s Place , mounted her horse , because the road was dirty , and all the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example .
She was a FAMOUS horse woman , and sat him to the admiration of all beholders ; but there was a puddle of red clay and water in this spot , and her ladyship ' s uniform habit was a sufferer by the accident .
Hal pursued it : he thought this bank was hard , but , alas !
He was unwilling to give up his uniform : it was rubbed and rubbed , and a spot here and there was washed out ; and he kept continually repeating ,--" When it ' s dry it will all brush off -- when it ' s dry it will all brush off , won ' t it ?"
I shall lose my turn to shoot ; oh , give me the coat ; I don ' t mind how it is , if I can but get it on ."
Holding it nearer and nearer to the fire dried it quickly , to be sure ; but it shrunk it also , so that it was no easy matter to get the coat on again .
" I suppose ," said he to his friend with the black patch --" I suppose my uncle and Ben had left home before you went for the shoes and stockings for me ?"
There was a great crowd of people .
pray let me into the circle !
In vain , when he got into the midst of the formidable circle , he looked to his friends , the young Sweepstakes , for their countenance and support .
They were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers .
" You have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit ; but I ' ve escaped rather better than you have .
In the midst of the history of his disaster , he was just proving to Patty that his taking the hatband to spin his top had nothing to do with his misfortune , and he was at the same time endeavouring to refute his uncle ' s opinion that the waste of the whipcord that tied the parcel was the original cause of all his evils , when he was summoned to try his skill with his FAMOUS bow .
I shall like to see .
You are to have three shots , with your own bow and your own arrows ; and nobody ' s to borrow or lend under pretence of other ' s bows being better or worse , or under any pretence .
Do you hear , Hal ?"
" You are a lucky fellow ; you have your three arrows ," said young Sweepstakes .
You may shoot with your own bow , if you choose it , or you may not , just as you think proper ; but you must not lend it , sir ."
" You have but one more ," said Master Sweepstakes --" now for it !"
OLD POZ .
Who ' s that ?
( Lucy sings , and goes on watering her myrtles ; the servant shows in the Old Man .)
Poor old man !
Ah !
Lucy ( aside ).
Lucy .
Old M . Why , miss , I slept last night at the inn here , in town -- the " Saracen ' s Head "--
Just .
There ' s no sugar in this , child .
Lucy .
Go , go , I ' m busy .
And the old man , papa ?
Just .
It was not he who was impatient .
It was only I , papa ; don ' t be angry .
ay !
what answer , pray , did you bring from the " Saracen ' s Head "?
Good morrow to your worship !
I came up with all speed ( taking breath ).
Land .
I thought your worship would excuse -- I ' m quite , as it were , rejoiced to see your worship look so purely , and to find you up so hearty --
Just .
And so our pie is in the oven , I think you say ?
Land .
I expect hostler and boots will be calling for their sandwiches just now ( laughs again ).
I ' ve been up and about these seven hours !
( stretching ).
Just .
No ceremony -- no ceremony ; good Mrs . Bustle , your servant .
The Landlady is putting on her shawl .
Just .
Hum !
( At these words the landlady turns round inquisitively , and delays , that she may listen , while she is putting on and pinning her shawl .)
Just .
My old gentleman , as I hope to breathe !
Land .
Land .
None of your flummery stuff will go down with his worship no more than with me , I give you warning ; so you may go further and fare worse , and spare your breath to cool your porridge .
( The Old Man comes forward .)
Just .
An old hypocrite , say .
Pray , Mrs . Bustle --
Land .
( turning suddenly round to Lucy ).
( Justice nods to the Old Man , who goes on .)
Old Man .
You shall have your turn presently .
Just .
At the " Saracen ' s Head "!
Again !
Old M . Yes , please your worship , and I accuse nobody ; but at night I had my little money safe , and in the morning it was gone .
Gone !-- gone , indeed , in my house !
Land .
Just .
Oh , for that matter , your worship knows best , to be sure .
SCENE III .
Ah , now , I ' m glad he can speak ; now tell papa ; and you need not be afraid to speak to him , for he is very good - natured .
Just .
Now speak on ; and you hear she tells you that you need not be afraid of me .
Old M . I thank your worship , I ' m sure .
Just .
Tut , tut , tut , man !-- took the money and left the box ?
I ' ll never believe THAT !
nonsense !
I won ' t believe it .
Lucy .
Why , what I say is this , that I don ' t dispute that that box , that you hold in your hands , is a box ; nay , for aught I know , it may be a tobacco - box -- but it ' s clear to me that if they left the box they did not take the money ; and how do you dare , sir , to come before Justice Headstrong with a lie in your mouth ; recollect yourself -- I ' ll give you time to recollect yourself .
( A pause .)
Just .
I ' ve done with you ; I have done .
( Lucy speaks to the Old Man as he is going off .)
Old M . IF I tell the truth --( turning up his eyes ).
Was the box shut fast when you left it ?
Lucy .
Land .
Lucy ( makes signs to the landlady to be silent ).
Just .
Hey !-- what , Mrs . Landlady -- the old magpie ?
Who ' d have thought it ?
Lucy .
You see I was right ; no MAN would have left the box , hey ?
I am the happiest man !
I know what I think -- you must keep that there magpie , and make a show of him , and I warrant he ' ll bring you many an honest penny ; for it ' s a TRUE STORY , and folks would like to hear it , I hopes --
And , friend , do you hear ?
you ' ll dine here today , you ' ll dine here .
We have some excellent ale .
I will have you drink my health -- that ' s poz !-- hey ?
Old M . ( bows ).
Ay , ay , drink her health -- she deserves it .
Then let us say no more ; but do justice immediately to the goose - pie ; and , darling , put me in mind to tell this story after dinner .
All Mrs . Theresa Tattle ' s suggestions being lost upon these stoical parents , her powers were next tried upon the children , and her success soon became apparent .
said Mrs . Tattle , to herself , " if I had such a tall daughter , and so unformed , before my eyes from morning to night , it would certainly break my poor heart .
Scarcely had Mrs . Montague ' s carriage got out of hearing when a note was brought , directed to " Frederick Montague , Junior , Esq .," which he immediately opened , and read as follows :--
She therefore trusts Mr . Frederick will not refuse to come and make her laugh .
Mrs . Theresa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite , who said she was particularly fond of them the other day .
no ," cried Frederick --" could , would , should , might , and ought , are all the same thing in the Latin grammar ; all of ' em signs of the potential mood , you know ."
said Sophy ; " and what has this to do with ' could ' and ' should '?
You wanted to prove --"
Sophy , who could not easily bear to be laughed at , with some little indignation , said , " Brother , I wish --"

It will come down to ' temperate ' by the time you look again ."
But she is temperate now , and I won ' t plague her ; she shall chop logic , if she likes it , though she is a woman ."
" Besides , that was only a conjuring trick ."
" Well !
" No , but you are drawing , and that ' s the same thing ."
Women who are always drawing and reasoning , never know how to make puddings .
" Well , I say you ' ll never learn how to make a good pudding ."
" Yes , but you ' d never do it exactly , and mind the spoonfuls right , by the recipe , like a cook ."
" I need not plump up to the elbows , brother ," said Sophy , smiling : " nor is it necessary that I should be a cook : but , if it were necessary , I hope I should be able to make a pudding ."
" Waiting !
She was " delighted " they were come , and " grieved " not to see Miss Sophy along with them .
not a drop of gravy .
I ' ll have none of it .
Pray go on , Dr .
" Oh , admirable !"
Such a wife as she makes ," continued Mrs . Theresa , lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven , " and so much as she has gone through , the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his will ; for turn it which way she will , she can never keep a carriage , or live like anybody else , on her jointure , after all , she tells me , poor soul !

Even in the midst of laughter , and whilst the voice of flattery yet sounded in his ear , Frederick felt sad , displeased with himself , and disgusted with Mrs . Theresa .
said Mrs . Theresa ; " what can make you sigh so bitterly ?
" Marianne ," cried Frederick , " do you remember the man in the mask ?"
" What man in the mask , brother ?"
" Oh yes ; indeed you must not leave me without taking something ; and Miss Marianne must have another macaroon .
We ' ll have candles ."
said Mrs . Theresa , who was standing at the fire , with her back to the door , when it opened , " Christopher !
pray bring -- Do you hear ?"
" The bell rang , ma ' am ,", answered a squeaking voice .
" My brother ?
" Ho , ho !"
" Yes , step down , do ; and , Christopher , bring up the cowslip - wine , and some more macaroons for my little Marianne ."
" Ma ' am , the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me the whole story .
The other little fellow was up at the top at the time , and he heard the cry ; but in his fright , and all , he did not know what to do , ma ' am ; for he looked about from the top of the chimney , and not a soul could he see stirring , but a few that he could not make attend to his screech ; the boy within almost stifling too .
" So , ma ' am , hearing the screech , he turns and sees the sweep ; and at once he understands the matter --"
* This atrocious practice is now happily superseded by the use of sweeping machines .
So I shall take an opportunity of saying , when I tell the story in all companies ; and the boy may thank his kind stars , I ' m sure , to the end of his days , for such an escape -- But pray , Christopher ," said she , persisting in her conversation with Christopher , who was now laying the cloth for supper , " pray , which house was it in Paradise Row ?
where the Eagles or the Miss Ropers lodge ?
cried Mrs . Theresa , " I thought we should get to the bottom of the affair at last .
" Now ," continued Mrs . Theresa , turning to Frederick , as soon as the servant had left the room , " now , Mr . Frederick Montague , I have a favour - - such a favour -- to ask of you ; it ' s a favour which only you can grant ; you have such talents , and would do the thing so admirably ; and my Lady Battersby would quite adore you for it .
She will do me the honour to be here to spend an evening to - morrow .
I am much obliged to you ; but indeed I cannot come ."
" Ask them !"
repeated Mrs . Theresa .
" Then I may make sure of you ," said Mrs . Theresa ; " for now it would be downright rudeness to tell a lady you won ' t do as she pleases .
A new and unintelligible system is presented to them , in a language foreign to their understanding , and contradictory to their feelings .
From the fear of being thought ignorant , they become affected ; and from the dread of being thought to be children act like fools .
And there is not a person at the Wells , I ' ll venture to say , could be of more advantage to your sister Sophy , in the way of partners , when she comes to go the balls , which it ' s to be supposed she will , some time or other ; and as you are so good a brother , that ' s a thing to be looked to , you know .
How you have made me beg and pray !
One knows him a mile off !
I ' m sure you , who are so quick , would only want to see him , and hear him , for half a minute , to be able to take him off , so as to kill one with laughing .
Merciful goodness !"
But Miss Bertha ' s bell will ring when she wakens for the sweeps , ma ' am .
" Well , never mind your suppositions ," said Mrs . Theresa ; " run down this very minute to the little squeaking chimney - sweep , and send him up to me .
He would not let her be wakened ."
said Marianne .
die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks !
How sorry her poor , poor brother will be !
" But I don ' t think it ' s right ," persisted Marianne , " and I shall tell him so ."
Hush !
Marianne was diverted by this scene ; but she started , when in the midst of it they heard a bell ring .
Mrs . Tattle and Marianne waited impatiently for Frederick ' s return .
he ' ll bleed to death !
A key !
cobwebs !
Oh , my brother !"
said Frederick ; " he shall hold the basin ."
" Oh , Sophy , don ' t you come -- don ' t look at me ; you ' ll despise me ."
" My brother !
" Miss Sophy , don ' t be alarmed ," Mrs . Theresa began ; " but gracious goodness !
I wish Miss Bertha --"
" Oh , Miss Bertha !"
" It ' s my brother , will he die ?"
answered a sweet voice : " do not frighten thyself ."
I only wanted , ma ' am , to hinder your brother from exposing himself .
" Here ," said Mr . Eden , opening the door of his room , which was on the opposite side of the hall to Mrs . Tattle ' s .
" Nay , my room ' s at Mr . Frederick Montague ' s service , and my door ' s open too .
But Frederick broke from her , and followed Mr . Eden .
And now can you forgive me , sir ?"
said Frederick to Mr . Eden , seizing hold of his hand .
" You are not mistaken ," cried Marianne .
exclaimed Mr . and Mrs . Montague .
my son !"
The dress hath not stained the mind ; that is fair and honourable .
Without making any reply , she hurried out of the room as fast as possible , and returned in a few moments , with a look of extreme consternation .
gone !
no sign of them in my closet , or anywhere .
The door was locked ; he must have gone up the chimney , out upon the leads , and so escaped ; but Christopher is after him .
I never heard of such a thing !
He will , I am persuaded , judge and act for himself more wisely in future .
He used to torment everybody with --" Do pray help me !
The doctor certainly was both proud and fond of him ; but he was so well beloved , or so much esteemed by his companions , that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of favourite , until the arrival of a new scholar of the name of Archer .
He went over to Archer , who , considering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy , received him with open arms , and translated his whole lesson without expressing MUCH contempt for his stupidity .
De Grey and Archer were now reading for a premium , which was to be given in their class .
So that this premium now became a matter of the greatest consequence , and Archer , instead of taking the means to secure a judgment in his favour , was listening to the opinions of all his companions .
The consequence was , that he trusted to chance -- his partisans lost their wagers , and he the premium -- and his temper .
Archer at least thought them long , for he was impatient till his voice could be heard .
When at length the acclamations had spent themselves , he walked across the stage with a knowing air , and looking round contemptuously .
or who would toil for popular applause ?"
cried Fisher , and tore down the curtain .
said Archer .
Everybody looked round to see where the voice came from .
Two window - shutters at the farthest end of the building were seen to move slowly inwards .
She did not speak ; but she looked first at one and then at another .
replied Archer .
" Not I !"
" Not you !
" There ," cried Townsend , as he chanced to stumble over the carpenter ' s mitre box , which stood in the way , " there ' s a good omen for me .
" I have a question to put ," said Fisher , in a solemn tone .
Everybody else drew back , and left him to whisper his question in the gipsy ' s ear .
cried Fisher with joy .
He found all the world at supper , but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his secret .
Put it to the vote ."
" O ye Athenians !"
The names of all the boys were called over , and when each had answered to his name , Dr . Middleton said --
You will be so good as to dismiss him .
Fired by this thought , which had never entered his mind before , Archer started from his reverie , and striking his hand upon the table , swore that he " would not be outwitted by any Greybeard in Europe -- no , nor by all of them put together .
" Oh , you are mistaken !"
" It cannot be a stroke aimed at ' you and your party ,' for he does not know that you HAVE a party ."
" You see , the moment he was not to be our manager , we were to have no theatre , no playhouse , no plays .
" He cannot have good reasons , or why not tell them ?"
You don ' t know me , De Grey .
I believe you are out of your senses , Archer !"
Did not you win the premium ?
" You called me a Greybeard , but my name is De Grey ," said he , still laughing .
" Ay , ay !"
If there is , let him walk off at once , he has my free leave ."
Archer gave the history of a " Barring Out ," in which he had been concerned at his school , in which the boys stood out against the master , and gained their point at last , which was a week ' s more holidays at Easter .
Let us be steady and he ' ll tremble .
replied Archer ; " and is not he a schoolmaster ?"
cried Archer , " that ' s the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig , who says he has good reasons , and can ' t tell them .
Who goes first ?"
A disorderly privilege ," says the doctor , " which , in his time , prevailed in the principal seminaries of education ."
In the Gentleman ' s Magazine of 1828 , Dr . P . A . Nuttall , under the signature of II .
Obedience , it seems , is necessary , even from rebels to their ringleaders ; not reasonable , but implicit obedience .
Scarcely had the assembly adjourned to the Ball - alley , when Fisher , with an important length of face , came up to the manager , and desired to speak one word to him .
" You may consult the old woman ," said Archer , bursting out a - laughing , " about what ' s right and wrong , if you please ; but no old woman shall decide for me ."
said the gipsy , lifting up her hands ; " never , never , never to be found !
Fisher , astonished , put his hand upon his heart , told her all that she knew before , and received the answers that Archer had dictated : " That the Archers should be lucky as long as they stuck to their manager , and to one another ; that the Barring Out should end in woe , if not begun precisely as the clock should strike nine on Wednesday night ; but if begun in that LUCKY moment , and all obedient to their LUCKY leader , all should end well ."
I ' m only talking of number one , you know .
My mouth waters for the buns , and have ' em I must now ."
Fisher , pray did you ever buy the candles for the playhouse ?"
" I ' ve got the candles ," whispered Fisher as he passed by Archer to his place .
said Archer .
A light was struck and each ran to his post .
-- in which he was joined by all the party most manfully -- by all but the poor Greybeard , who , the picture of astonishment , stood stock still in the midst of them with his books under his arm ; at which spectacle Townsend , who enjoyed the FROLIC of the fray more than anything else , burst into an immoderate fit of laughter .
Won ' t you let me out ?"
I should like to show him our fortifications .
" Four candles !-- Four candles on the table .
There ' s nothing like a fair scramble , my boys .
" No , no ," cried Townsend , " evil communication corrupts good manners ."
" Hang to - morrow !"
said a voice , which was known to be the gardener ' s ; and in the midst of their surprise and dismay the candles were suddenly extinguished ; the trap - door shut down ; and they were left in utter darkness .
" Hold your tongue , blockhead !"
" It ' s a wonder NOBODY ever thought of the trap - door !"
He heard in his turn the murmurs of a discontented , changeable populace ; and recollecting all his bars and bolts , and ingenious contrivances , he was more provoked at their blaming him for this one only oversight than he was grieved at the disaster itself .
" Heigh - day !
Britannia rules the waves !
There is great pleasure in bearing anything that has the appearance of hardship as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it : but when people feel themselves foiled , there is no further pleasure in endurance ; and if , in their misfortune , there is any mixture of the ridiculous , the motives for heroism are immediately destroyed .
And Townsend , why , he has puns in plenty ; but , when there ' s any work to be done , he ' s the worst fellow to be near one in the world -- he can do nothing but laugh at his own puns .
Thus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping friends .
The sound of my hammering must waken them ; so I may as well do the thing handsomely , and flatter some of them by pretending to ask their advice ."
At the farthest end of the room they likewise formed a penthouse of the tables , under which they proposed to breakfast , secure from the pelting storm , if it should again assail them through the trap - door .
This ventilator Archer had taken down , and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure ; but , upon examination , it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back , which it was impossible to penetrate or remove .
He listened and waited for his cousins ; but no cousins came , and at a late hour the company were obliged to breakfast upon the scattered fragments of the last night ' s feast .
I ' ll give you one whole one for yourself , if you will unbar the window for me ."
" Have not I done everything I could to please you ?
I have not tasted one mouthful today !
Did not I lie awake all night for you ?
fools !
said he , snatching the bun , which nobody had dared to touch , " take it -- it ' s mine -- I give it to you , though you are a Greybeard ; you deserve it .
You shall be my captain ; will you ?"
coward !
But the storm was only hushed .
Fisher and his nine , who had such firm dependence upon the gipsy , now gave themselves up to utter despair .
Any man who chooses it may have a party as well as yourself , I suppose .
" Have I no friend ?-- no real friend amongst you all ?
" We want something to eat ," answered the Fishermen .
" I will let him in ," said he , " myself ; for I ' m sure he ' ll never break his word ."
He pulled away the bar ; the door opened , and having bargained for the liberty of Melson , the little boy , who had been shut in by mistake , De Grey entered with his basket of provisions , when he locked and barred the door instantly .
" And you will join us , will you ?
added he , pointing to Archer .
" What nonsense ," and the orator paused for a synonymous expression , but none was at hand .
I say , we ' d better all be flogged at once , which must be the end of it sooner or later , than wait here to be without dinner , breakfast , and supper , all only because Mr . Archer won ' t give up because of his honour and nonsense !"
Many prudent faces amongst the Fishermen seemed to deliberate at the close of this oration , in which the arguments were brought so " home to each man ' s business and bosom ."
" But ," said De Grey , " when we yield , I hope it will not be merely to get our dinner , gentlemen .
When we yield , Archer --"
I have no power , no party , you see !
De Grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any party , when a sudden change appeared on Archer ' s countenance .
I know how to make use of everything .
friend !
" Yes , but we are barred out here ."
Several times the bag descended and ascended ; and at every unlading of the crane , fresh acclamations were heard .
You are out of your wits , and therefore may set up for a hero ."
My Aunt Barbara , for one , would be AT HIM long before that time was out ; and besides , you know , in that case , he ' d be hanged for murder , which is quite another thing , in law , from a BARRING OUT , you know ."
" Hey - day !"
And does the chief of the Archers stand talking sentiment to the chief of the Greybeards ?
said De Grey .
" But you cannot think anything honourable , or the contrary ," observed De Grey , " without reasoning ; and as to what you call feeling , it ' s only a quick sort of reasoning ."
Is it not , therefore , best to begin by reasoning to find out the right AT FIRST ?"
" Why ," said De Grey , " should you suspect me of such a mean action , when you have never seen or known me do anything mean , and when in this instance you have no proofs ?"
" Not quite ."
" Not quite !
Then , indeed you are unreasonable !"
" Not I !
The windows were thrown up , and the first feeling of the fresh air was delightful .
Archer threw open the door , and Dr . Middleton entered .
Now , as to your punishment !"
He repeated , however , that he trusted he should bear it well , whatever it might be .
The rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctor ' s sentence against them , but not with those looks of abject fear with which boys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster .
" Oh , sir !
Here the boys , with one accord , ran to the place where they had deposited their last supplies .
" No ," said Archer , " he had half a crown on purpose to pay for them ."
" I know he had , but he chose to apply it to his private use , and gave it to the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own eating .
" You need not assure me , sir ," said Dr . Middleton ; " I cannot suspect a boy of your temper of having any part in so base an action .
In a beautiful and retired part of England lived Mrs . Villars , a lady whose accurate understanding , benevolent heart , and steady temper peculiarly fitted her for the most difficult , as well as most important , of all occupations -- the education of youth .
Leonora was of a contented , unaspiring temperate character ; not easily roused to action , but indefatigable when once excited .
Many loved Leonora , but none were ever governed by her , for she was too indolent to govern .
Everyone put their writings , their drawings , their works of various kinds upon the tables appropriated for each .
How each little hand trembled as it laid down its claims !
Till this moment everyone thought herself secure of success ; and the heart , which exulted with hope , now palpitated with fear .
The works were examined , the preference adjudged , and the prize was declared to be the happy Cecilia ' s .
Mrs . Villars kissed Cecilia ' s little hand .
Oh !
Leonora , however , preserved her usual consistency .
" Poor Louisa !"
said she , looking first at her , and then reproachfully at Cecilia .
" But you could have helped laughing , Cecilia ."
" I am sure , however ," replied Leonora , " I should not have laughed if I had --"
" No , to be sure , you wouldn ' t , because Louisa is your favourite .
She grew still more impatient .
" Come , let us play at something else -- at threading the needle ," said she , holding out her hand .
They all yielded to the hand which wore the bracelet .
" No , but am not I your friend ?"
and when it was broken , could I do more than promise her another ; was that unjust ?"
" Oh , as to that , Cecilia , you know I need not answer you unless I choose it ; not but what I would if you would only ask me civilly , and if you would not call me CHILD ."
I have not eaten one of them ; they are all for your friend Leonora .
" I won ' t give you one of my strawberries , for I don ' t like you at all !"
said Cecilia , recollecting herself ; " Louisa !
" Stop !
Cecilia !"
" Leonora !"
Mrs . Villars told me that this day should be mine .
This is , perhaps , one of the happiest days of your life ."
You know that when I ask you to tell me anything as your friend , I never punish you as your governess ; therefore you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter ."
And yet I think you would love me ; for I hope that I am as ready to oblige , and as good - natured as --"
" No , indeed , I understand by them two very different things .
You are good - natured , Cecilia ; for you are desirous to oblige and serve your companions -- to gain them praise , and save them from blame -- to give them pleasure , and relieve them from pain ; but Leonora is good - tempered , for she can bear with their foibles , and acknowledge her own .
In short , her temper is perfectly good ; for it can bear and forbear ."
Turn the same exertion and perseverance which have won you the prize to - day to this object , and you will meet with the same success ; perhaps not on the first , the second , or the third attempt ; but depend upon it that you will at last .
But you must not expect to succeed all at once .
She walked on with Mrs . Villars in silence , until they came under the shade of the elm - tree walk , and there , fixing her eyes upon Mrs . Villars , she stopped short .
" And why do they hate it ?"
" Very likely .
And when you are in a passion , as you call it , Cecilia , you see that you are tempted to do harm to others .
If they do not feel angry themselves , they do not sympathize with you .
They do not perceive the motive which actuates you ; and then they say that you have a bad heart .
" Then make that sorry of use to you , Cecilia , and fix it steadily in your thoughts , as you hope to be good and happy , that if you suffer yourself to yield to your passion upon every occasion , anger and its consequences will become familiar to your mind ; and , in the same proportion , your sense of shame will be weakened , till what you began with doing from sudden impulse you will end with doing from habit and choice : then you would , indeed , according to our definition , have a bad heart ."
" Good - night to you , madam ," said Cecilia ; and she ran upstairs to bed .
Ambition she knew to be its most powerful incentive .
In consequence of this reasoning , Cecilia formed a design of proposing to her companions that they should give a prize , the first of the ensuing month ( the lst of June ), to the most amiable .
Mrs . Villars applauded the scheme , and her companions adopted it with the greatest alacrity .
was now the question .
A slight difference in the manner makes a very material one in the effect .
By constant attention and exertion she had considerably abated the violence of her temper , and changed the course of her habits .
This was the fundamental error of her mind ; it arose in a great measure from her early education .
All small objects and small errors she had been taught to disregard as trifles ; and her impatient disposition was perpetually leading her into more material faults ; yet her candour in confessing these , she had been suffered to believe , was sufficient reparation and atonement .
It exceeds the merits of its object , and is connected with a feeling of generosity , rather than with a sense of justice .
They were both sitting together in Louisa ' s room .
" It ' s only a china figure , miss , which I am going to carry to an elderly lady , who lives nigh hand , and who is mighty fond of such things ."
exclaimed Cecilia .
" Oh , no , miss , I didn ' t promise it -- she never saw it ; and if so be that you ' d like to take it , I ' d make no more words about it ."
" And how much does it cost ?"
Where ' s the mandarin ?
Oh , I have it ," said she , taking it up , and looking at it with the utmost disgust .
and then everybody will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw , and the broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever ."
Here Cecilia ' s hand moved , and she was just going to decide : " Oh , but stop ," said she to herself , " consider -- Leonora gave me this box , and it is a keepsake .
She knew that they came as purchasers , and she dreaded her Flora ' s becoming the prize of some higher bidder .
Let those who are tempted to do wrong by the hopes of future gratification , or the prospect of certain concealment and impunity , remember that , unless they are totally depraved , they bear in their own hearts a monitor , who will prevent their enjoying what they ill obtained .
In vain Cecilia ran to the rest of her companions , to display her present , in hopes that the applause of others would restore her own self - complacency ; in vain she saw the Flora pass in due pomp from hand to hand , each vying with the other in extolling the beauty of the gift and the generosity of the giver .
From Louisa ' s gratitude , however , she yet expected much pleasure , and immediately she ran upstairs to her room .
On going to her room she found her asleep , and she sat softly down by her bedside .
" Goodness !"
" That may be ," said Louisa ; " but I remember scratching that L with my own needle , and Cecilia scolded me for it , too .
She was comparing circumstances , which had before escaped her attention .
I daresay she had lost it ."
cried Louisa , starting up .
" For me , perhaps !"
You shall give it to me entirely ; and as your keepsake , I ' ll keep it as long as I live ."
" But ," said she , looking up wistfully in Cecilia ' s face , and holding the Flora doubtfully , " did you --"
But as soon as the formentation of her spirits subsided , the sense of shame , which had been scarcely felt when mixed with so many other sensations , rose uppermost in her mind .
Her father ' s word to her brother , on the occasion , she also perfectly recollected .
But Leonora little knew the cause of her gaiety .
Cecilia was never in higher spirits , or better pleased with herself , than when she had resolved upon a sacrifice or a confession .
Cecilia ' s voice could be distinguished far above the rest .
when we were always together the best of friends and companions ; our wishes , tastes , and pleasures the same !
Let me be just , though she has offended me ; she is wonderfully improved within this last month .
For one fault , and THAT against myself , shall I forget all her merits ?"
They had left her alone in the gallery .
" Oh , yes !
I should not feel the least more pleasure at hearing it in public , or in having it made known to all my companions , especially at a time when it would give poor Cecilia a great deal of pain ."
called her impatient companions ; " don ' t you hear us ?
What are you about ?"
" Remember , then , that you have promised me ," said Leonora , and she left the room .
During all this time , Cecilia had been in the garden with her companions .
She stood still at last to admire her works .
At last , " Where is Leonora ?"
cried one of them ; and immediately , as we have seen , they ran to call her .
Overcome with heat and too violent exertion , she had hardly strength to support herself ; each moment appeared to her intolerably long .
She was in a state of the utmost suspense , and all her courage failed her .
If I should not win the prize , how shall I confess what I have done ?
They most of them ran forwards to Cecilia .
" Now they are all in !
There was a dead silence .
don ' t praise me ; I don ' t deserve this ," said she , turning to her loudly applauding companions .
Oh , Leonora , you will never forgive me !
" Louisa !"
" And Louisa also desired me ," said she , " to return to you this Flora ."
Leonora caught it .
" Then , dear Cecilia , accept of mine instead of it !
" Yes ," said Mrs . Villars , " and let Cecilia carry the bracelet to her ; she deserves that reward .
CHAPTER I .
Hence they proceed with their baskets into the heart of the city , where in several places they form a sort of little market , sitting round with their stock of wood before them .
Labourers , and the lower order of citizens , buy it of them to burn in the tripods for warming themselves , or to use in their scanty kitchens .
The most cunning cheat is at last detected and disgraced .
He taught him , that to make a GOOD BARGAIN was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of ; to get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence .
' It is better to be lucky than wise .'"
Good judges of men and fish knew that he said what was false , and passed him by with neglect ; but it was at last what he called GOOD LUCK to meet with the very same young raw servant - boy who would have bought the bruised melon from Francisco .
said the boy .
The servant - boy was imposed upon ; and being a foreigner , speaking the Italian language but imperfectly , and not being expert at reckoning the Italian money , he was no match for the cunning Piedro , who cheated him not only as to the freshness , but as to the price of the commodity .
This is your morning ' s work , I presume , and you ' ll make another journey to Naples to - day , on the same errand , I warrant , before your father thinks you have done enough ?"
" Wisdom I think it still ," said Francisco .
" And your father ?"
asked Piedro .
" Stay ," said Francisco ; " you forgot that the booby you took in to - day will not be so easily taken in to - morrow .
" One customer does not make a market ; if he buys no more from me , what care I ?
" If they will be only so good as to give me leave ," said Piedro , laughing , and repeating his father ' s proverb , "' Venture a small fish to catch a large one .'"
There are a great many of them , enough to last me all the summer , if I lose a customer a day ," said Piedro .
as my father says .
Unless you were HONEST FRANCISCO , you would not fill his panniers quite so readily .
".
Though he had simplicity enough to be easily cheated once , he had too much sense to be twice made a dupe .
The next time he met Piedro in the market , he happened to be in company with several English gentlemen ' s servants , and he pointed Piedro out to them all as an arrant knave .
*
" Is he not well ?"
" Bless you , my good boy ; I should take you for an Englishman , by your way of dealing .
I ' ll come to the vineyard if it was ten miles off ; and all the time we stay in Naples ( may it not be so long as I fear it will !
), with my master ' s leave , which he never refuses me to anything that ' s proper , I ' ll deal with you for all our fruit , as sure as my name ' s Arthur , and with none else , with my good will .
His master , who was an Englishman of distinction , was invited to take up his residence , during his stay in Italy , at the Count de F .' s villa , which was in the environs of Naples -- an easy walk from Resina .
" So I have , father , enough and enough , when I see you and mother going on so well .
Piedro the cunning did not make quite so successful a summer ' s work as did Francisco the honest .
On the contrary , he was hardened to the sense of shame by the loss of reputation .
It is not easy to get rid of a bad character .
* Chartres .
Something like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he experienced the evils of a bad reputation , and when he saw the numerous advantages which Francisco ' s good character procured .
Won ' t your father be apt to miss them ?"
" No ; ever since my father beat me , and called me rogue before all the children there , I have never been able to show my face without being gibed at by one or t ' other .
" I would rather BE than seem your friend , if I could ," said Francisco .
repeated Piedro , thinking that he hesitated from merely mercenary motives .
If I could get them to trust me as they do you , I should be happy indeed ."
With the money he had earned by two months ' trading in fruit he laid in a large stock of what appeared to these little merchants a stock of almonds and sugar - plums , and he painted in capital gold coloured letters upon his board , " Sweetest , largest , most admirable sugar - plums of all colours ever sold in Naples , to be had here ; and in gratitude to his numerous customers , Piedro adds to these , ' Burnt almonds gratis .
Crowds of children surrounded Piedro ' s board of promise , and they all went away the first day amply satisfied .
This belief , and Piedro ' s popularity , continued longer even than he had expected ; and , as he thought his sugar - plums had secured their reputation with the GENEROUS PUBLIC , he gradually neglected to add burnt almonds gratis .
One day a boy of about ten years old passed carelessly by , whistling as he went along , and swinging a carpenter ' s rule in his hand .
" Then why are they in your advertisement here ?"
" What !
" You are most impatient ," said Piedro ; " I shall have a fresh stock of almonds to - morrow ."
" A lie may ruin you , but I could scarcely think the truth could ."
" You have no right to meddle with me or my board ," said Piedro , put off his guard , and out of his usual soft voice of civility , by this last observation .
Do as you please with your board , but give me my sugar - plums , for I have some right to meddle with those , having paid for them ."
The crowd gathered from all parts of the square as he spoke .
" We have bought ," and " We have bought of those sugar - plums ," cried several little voices at once , " if you mean Piedro ' s ."
said Carlo , going up to this silent person .
Can this Piedro be a friend of yours ?"
I have reason to be obliged to you , for I was nearly taken in .
exclaimed a number of little merchants crowding round him .
They pressed on to Francisco ' s board , obtained his measure , found that it held something more than a quarter above the quantity that could be contained in Piedro ' s .
The cries of the enraged populace were now most clamorous .
He is a bankrupt in honesty ."
Piedro saw the mob , heard the indignant clamour , and , terrified at the approach of numbers , he fled with the utmost precipitation , having scarcely time to pack up half his sugar - plums .
Is there anything else you could think of for me ?"
repeated Francisco , not a little alarmed at the high sounding word ; " that ' s what I certainly shall never understand ."
" Why ," said Carlo , " you ' ll find all these things are nothing when you are used to them .
But I cannot explain my rule to you here broiling in the sun .
said Francisco , as he was sitting one morning with his tutor , the carpenter .
" To be sure it will ," said the carpenter , putting down his compasses , with which he was drawing a circle --" Arithmetic is a most useful , and I was going to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations ; and a little trigonometry does no harm .
Safe companions these for young and old .
Here the carpenter , just as he was going to pronounce a fresh panegyric upon his favourite trigonometry , was interrupted by the sudden entrance of his little daughter Rosetta , all in tears : a very unusual spectacle , for , taking the year round , she shed fewer tears than any child of her age in Naples .
Why these large tears ?"
said her brother Carlo , and he went up to her , and wiped them from her cheeks .
I must stop these tears , too ," said Carlo .
As soon as I had filled my basket , and made up my faggot ( which was not done , brother , till I was almost baked by the sun , for I was forced to wait by the carpenters for the bits of wood to make up my faggot )-- I say , when it was all ready , and my basket full , I left it altogether in the yard ."
" That was not wise to leave it ," said Carlo .
Despairing of discovering the thief , Francisco and Carlo left the market .
As soon as he heard of Rosetta ' s lost faggot , and of the bit of wood , notched at one end , of which Rosetta drew the shape with a piece of chalk , which her brother had lent her , Arthur exclaimed , " I have seen such a bit of wood as this within this quarter of an hour ; but I cannot recollect where .
Stay !
The baker had scarcely finished speaking when Francisco , who was standing watching at the door , exclaimed , " Here comes Piedro !
Baker ?"
" He is the boy , though ," replied the baker , and Piedro , who now entered the shop , started at the sight of Carlo and Francisco , whom he had never seen since the day of disgrace in the fruit - market .
Piedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied Rosetta ' s basket , and imagining that he was suspected only upon the bare assertion of a child like Rosetta , who might be baffled and frightened out of her story , boldly denied the charge , and defied any one to prove him guilty .
On their way , they had passed through the fruit - market , and crowds of those who were well acquainted with Piedro ' s former transactions followed , to hear the event of the present trial .
They preferred their own summary mode of proceeding .
Francisco had great perseverance , and , by repeated trials , he at length succeeded in copying exactly all the plans which his master lent him .
" Ay , that rule ," said Francisco --" how much I owe to it !
" I see , because I am an Englishman ," said he , " you don ' t value my friendship , and yet that is the very reason you ought to value it ; no friends so good as the English , be it spoken without offence to your Italian friend , for whom you now continually leave me to dodge up and down here in Resina , without a soul that I like to speak to , for you are the only Italian I ever liked ."
It was the utmost stretch of Arthur ' s complaisance to pay this visit ; but , in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper , he was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous Carlo and the playful Rosetta .
They showed him Francisco ' s drawings with enthusiastic eagerness ; and Arthur , though no great judge of drawing , was in astonishment , and frequently repeated , " I know a gentleman who visits my master who would like these things .
Mr . Lee was at this time in treaty with an Italian painter , whom he wished to engage to copy for him exactly some of the cornices , mouldings , tablets , and antique ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient city of Herculaneum .
Streams of lava run down the sides of the mountains during the time of an eruption , destroying everything in their way , and overwhelm the houses and vineyards which are in the neighbourhood .
The workmen , as they cleared the passages , marked their way with chalk when they came to any turning , lest they should lose themselves .
What an advantage your instruction would be to him ," said Mr . Lee , as he introduced Francisco to Signor Camillo .
If you will give him some knowledge of your art , I will , as far as money can recompense you for your loss of time , pay whatever you may think reasonable for his instruction ."
don ' t you know in which book to look for it , Francisco ?"
" That you never saw it , young man , is the very thing of which I complain .
" And so the time is come , excellent young man ," cried Camillo ; " much as I love taste , I love integrity more .
His confidence in Francisco was much increased by this circumstance , slight as it may appear .
Signor Camillo , who was copying these for his English employer , had a mind to try his pupil ' s skill , and , pointing to a niche bordered with grotesque figures , he desired him to try if he could make any hand of it .
Francisco made several trials , and at last finished such an excellent copy , that his enthusiastic and generous master , with warm encomiums , carried it immediately to his patron , and he had the pleasure to receive from Mr . Lee a purse containing five guineas , as a reward and encouragement for his pupil .
most charming !"
" Add this fine pine - apple for my share , then ," said his father , " and a pleasant walk to you , my young friends ."
The moon shone full upon his countenance , which was very expressive and which varied frequently according to the characters of the persons whose history he was telling , according to all the changes of their fortune .
He fixed his eyes upon Francisco , then glanced at Carlo and Rosetta , and after a moment ' s consideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that our young English readers may , perhaps , know by the name of " Cornaro , or the Grateful Turk ."
Pray , gentlemen , find my hat amongst you ; it was a remarkably good one , a present from a nobleman for an epigram I made .
" The hat has vanished by magic ," said Dominicho .
" Still at your old tricks , Piedro ," said he .
" I have no need to steal hats ; I can afford to buy better than you ' ll have upon your head .
you rich ?"
" Well , then , it was impossible you could mean to trick that poor man out of his good hat ."
" Impossible !
" This does not smell of fish , does it ?
My father is no longer a fisherman , nor I either .
I have many pieces of gold like this .
I have this day agreed for a house in Naples for my father .
We shall live , whilst we can afford it , like great folks , you will see ; and I shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my old friends , the little Neapolitan merchants , who will change their note when they see my change of fortune .
" That I wish you joy of your prosperity , and hope you may enjoy it long and well ."
" Yes , no longer pipe , no longer dance ," replied Francisco ; and here they parted ; for Piedro walked away abruptly , much mortified to perceive that his prosperity did not excite much envy , or command any additional respect from Francisco .
Do you know he has found a treasure , he says , in his father ' s garden -- a vase full of gold ?
" Much good may they do him .
Let him make himself happy his way , and we ours .
Regardless , or pretending to be regardless , of these suspicions , Piedro and his father persisted in their assertions .
*
* La vita il fine ,-- e di loda la sera .
He found the truth of the proverb , " that credit lost is like a Venice glass broken -- it can ' t be mended again ."
The carriage was overturned near him ; a lady was taken out of it , and was hurried by her attendants into a shop , where she stayed till her carriage was set to rights .
Piedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage , seized upon it , and carried it off .
Piedro started back ; but his father had fast hold of him .
Tell me what brings you here at this time of the night ?
His father could but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp , which hung over their heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood .
It is well it has fallen into my hands .
How came you by it ?"
He now confessed that it had dropped from the dress of a lady , whose carriage was overturned as she was coming home from the opera , and he concluded by saying that , if his father took his prize from him without giving him his share of the profits , he would go directly to the shop where the lady stopped whilst her servants were raising the carriage , and that he would give notice of his having found the cross .
We do not wish to lay open to our young readers scenes of iniquity .
The matter was managed so that the transaction remained undiscovered .
How difficult it is to stop in the career of vice !
* I fatti sono maschii , le parole femmine .
They retired , in hopes of finding a more gentle padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood ; and the fury , when they were out of sight , divided the long black hair which hung over her face , and , turning to one of the spectators , appealed to them in a sober voice , and asked if she was not right in what she had done ?
I have been obliged to make my husband lengthen the ropes every day for this week past .
If things go on at this rate , there will soon be not one drop of water left in my well ."
" Nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood ," added one of the workmen , who was standing by ; and he mentioned several in which the water had lately suddenly decreased ; and a miller affirmed that his mill had stopped for want of water .
The prudent Englishman had not the gallantry to appear to be convinced by these arguments , and he left the place of danger .
A few days after the eruption , the surface of the lava became so cool that people could walk upon it , though several feet beneath the surface it was still exceedingly hot .
But these unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had been pillaged by robbers , who , in these moments of general confusion , enrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow - creatures .
It is all over with Resina !"
Has the lava reached Resina ?"
said the count to Francisco , " I thank you , and shall not limit my gratitude to thanks .
It is scarcely a twelvemonth since I drew tears from your eyes ."
" Tears from my eyes ?"
I have had but few misfortunes in my life ."
The stranger answered him by two extempore Italian lines , which conveyed nearly the same idea that has been so well expressed by an English poet :--
The count patronizes me .
I am here now to learn the fate of an ode I have just composed for his lady ' s birthday .
These were his young companions , who remembered him as a fruit - seller amongst the little merchants .
said a man , pushing his way through the crowd .
I have found at last a story that interests you more than that of Cornaro the Turk ," cried the Improvisatore , looking in the face of the youth , who had stopped so suddenly .
Not one word of the heroic action performed at the villa of the Count de Flora , near Torre del Greco , this morning , by Signor Francisco ."
" Your hat is very safe , I promise you ; I shall not touch it .
" SIGNOR Francisco I may , without impropriety , call him ," said the Improvisatore , " for he is likely to become rich enough to command the title from those who might not otherwise respect his merit ."
said the lad , whom our readers have probably before this time discovered to be Piedro .
" Come away ," and he hurried forwards .
The universal confusion which followed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius was to these villains a time of rejoicing .
No sooner did Piedro ' s companion hear of the rich furniture , plate , etc ., which the imprudent orator had described as belonging to the Count de Flora ' s villa , than he longed to make himself master of the whole .
I know him from a child , and we had better think of some other house for to - night ' s business ."
Piedro , who was of a cowardly nature , trembled at the threatening countenance of his captain , and promised submission .
Piedro ' s voice failed , and some of his comrades observed that he was young and new to the business .
He again recollected what had been said about poniards , and the longer his mind fixed upon the words , and the look that accompanied them , the more he was shocked .
His wretched father died some weeks before this time , in a fit of intoxication .
It was at the Jew ' s that he connected himself with this gang of robbers , to whom he was now become an absolute slave .
said he to himself , with a deep sigh , as he knocked softly at the back door of the Jew ' s house .
These rooms were separated by a dark passage from the rest of the house , and numbers of people came to the shop in the front of the house , which looked into a creditable street , without knowing anything more , from the ostensible appearance of the shop , than that it was a kind of pawnbroker ' s , where old clothes , old iron , and all sorts of refuse goods , might be disposed of conveniently .
He was pale and trembling , and felt a cold dew spread over him .
He had a leaden image of Saint Januarius tied round his neck , which , in the midst of his wickedness , he superstitiously preserved as a sort of charm , and on this he kept his eyes stupidly fixed , as he sat alone in this gloomy place .
" I don ' t deny that it has been wet ," said the man , " but since it was in the bucket of water , it has been carefully dried .
I tell you the simple truth , that so soon after the grand eruption of Mount Vesuvius , the people of Naples will not relish fireworks .
where ?"
His villa is to be attacked this night by four well armed men .
With all possible expedition he ran to the count ' s palace in Naples , and related to him all that had been said by Piedro .
At length they set out , and just as they reached the villa , the flash of the pistol was seen from one of the apartments in the house .
His captain and his accomplices were sent to the galleys , and the Jew was banished from Naples .
Arthur was no bad surgeon , for he let his patient get well as fast as he pleased ; and Carlo and Rosetta nursed him with so much kindness , that he was almost sorry to find himself perfectly recovered .
" Yes ," cried Carlo ; " the inhabitants of Resina , and several who had property near Terre del Greco , and whose houses and lives were saved by your intrepidity in carrying the materials for the fireworks and the gunpowder out of this dangerous place , went in a body to the duke , and requested that he would mention your name and these facts to the king , who , amongst the grants he has made to the sufferers by the late eruption of Mount Vesuvius , has been pleased to say that he gives this house and garden to your father , because you have saved the property and lives of many of his subjects ."
Arthur would not accept of any present from him .

Young Hardy was educated by Mr . Freeman , a very excellent master , at one of our rural Sunday schools .
When they had got it up to three hundred and twenty , the game became very interesting .
What a pity that he did not stand with his back to the sun !"
" But you know we must not go into the lane ," said Loveit , hesitatingly .
Loveit coloured , went on drumming , and again , in a lower voice , said " HE DIDN ' T KNOW ."
" Yes , but you are ," said Hardy , coming forward .
said Loveit ; " of what , pray , am I afraid ?"
repeated Tarlton , mimicking him , so that he made everybody laugh .
Hardy smiled ; and Loveit , half afraid of his contempt , and half afraid of Tarlton ' s ridicule , stood doubtful , and again had recourse to his battledore , which he balanced most curiously upon his forefinger .
" I don ' t squint ," said Loveit , looking up , " and nobody has me under his thumb !
" Whom do they call Little Panado ?"
" Here ," cried he , returning in about five minutes , quite out of breath , " I ' ve got the shuttlecock ; and I ' ll tell you what I ' ve seen ," cried he , panting for breath .
cried everybody , eagerly .
Each boy gave his hand and his promise ; repeating , " Stand by me , and I ' ll stand by you ."
It is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by the good and the bad .
Once , as Loveit was climbing the apple - tree , he thought he heard a door in the cottage open , and earnestly begged his companions to desist and return home .
I wish I had been sleeping too ."
It was in vain that he urged Tarlton to permit him to consult his friend .
A gloom overspread Tarlton ' s brow when he began to speak on the subject , and he always returned a peremptory refusal , accompanied with some such taunting expression as this --" I wish we had nothing to do with such a sneaking fellow ; he ' ll betray us all , I see , before we have done with him ."
Farmer Kent lent his dog Barker , cautioning his neighbour , at the same time , to be sure to chain him well , for he was the fiercest mastiff in England .
Night came ; and Tarlton , Loveit and his companions , returned at the usual hour .
They stood still as if fixed to the spot .
At last , torn and terrified , he got through the hedge and ran home , despising his companions for their selfishness .
" Strange !
why , yes ; I thought you all loved me !"
" Hardy would not have served me so , however ," said Loveit , turning away in disgust .
" Ah , do come now ," said Tarlton , in a voice of persuasion .
Tarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into temper again ; and even though he was not very apt to part with his playthings , went so far as to say , " Loveit , the other day you wanted a top ; I ' ll give you mine if you desire it ."
" Come a little farther however ," said Tarlton , looking round suspiciously .
exclaimed Loveit .
" Yes ; I vowed I ' d be revenged on him , and after this he ' ll never bark again ."
What do you mean ?
" Why , you know , I might not know ; for Tom told me it ' s a thing that ' s often done .
After prayers , as they were going to bed , Loveit stopped Tarlton ,--" WELL !"
" Oh ," said he , " it will be quite spoiled before morning !"
They both went to the top of the stairs to call Tom ; no one answered .
" I ' m here ," answered he at last , coming out of Tarlton ' s room with a look of mixed embarrassment and effrontery .
" What are you doing there ?"
exclaimed Loveit aloud , with an emotion which he could not command .
" For God ' s sake , what are you going to do ?"
said Loveit , in great anxiety .
they ' ll never forgive !
" You do ," said Hardy , with great indignation : and a violent struggle immediately commenced .
The handkerchief fell within reach of the dog , who instantly snapped at it ; luckily it did not come untied .
" Come up , whoever you are ," said Mr . William Power , in a stern voice .
Hardy obeyed without reply .--" Hardy !"
Will you please to do me the favour , sir , if it is not too much trouble , to empty your pockets ."
what next ?"
" Why don ' t you speak ?"
" Down upon your knees this minute and confess all : tell me where you ' ve been , what you ' ve been doing , and who are your accomplices , for I know there is a gang of you ; so ," added he , pressing heavily upon Hardy ' s shoulder , " down upon your knees this minute , and confess the whole , that ' s your only way now to get off yourself .
" Very well , sir !
" THAT , to be sure , was wrong ," said Hardy , recollecting himself ; " but except that --"
The conversation which had passed between Hardy and Mr . Power at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to ; but only a word or two here and there had been distinctly overheard .
" How could you do so ?
repeated poor Loveit , with a sigh ; " well , that is hard ."
there ' s the bell ," exclaimed a number of voices at once .
Everybody stood stock still ; he walked out of the circle ; they guessed that he was gone for Hardy , and the whole room was in commotion .
" I hope he has not told of me ," cried they .
" You don ' t think he ' s such a fool , when he can get himself off ," said Tarlton .
" Well , sir ," said Mr . Power , sitting down in Mr . Trueman ' s elbow - chair , and placing the prisoner opposite to him ; " well , sir , what have you to say to me this morning ?"
" Now , sir , give me leave ," said the usher , eagerly drawing him aside , and whispering .
" So , sir ," said Mr . T . when the whisper was done , addressing himself to Hardy , with a voice and manner which , had he been guilty , must have pierced him to the heart , " I find I have been deceived in you ; it is but three hours ago that I told your uncle I never had a boy in my school in whom I placed so much confidence ; but , after all this show of honour and integrity , the moment my back is turned , you are the first to set an example of disobedience of my orders .
" I hope you won ' t let him impose upon you , sir ."
Tarlton turned pale ; Hardy ' s countenance never changed .
" Thank you , sir ," said Tarlton , getting up and wiping his eyes .
" You need not thank me ," said Mr . Trueman .
At these words Loveit first , and immediately all the rest of the guilty party , stepped out of the ranks , confessed their fault , and declared themselves ready to bear any punishment their master thought proper .
Hardy looked as if he wished to speak .
" Not because you ask it ," said Mr . Trueman to the guilty penitents , " though I should be glad to oblige you -- it wouldn ' t be just ; but there ," pointing to Hardy , " there is one who has merited a reward ; the highest I can give him is that of pardoning his companions ."
" I am sure ," thought Loveit , " this is a lesson I shall never forget ."
THE BASKET - WOMAN .
She had not much to give , but what she had she gave with good - will .
She earned money also in another way .
One evening , as they were standing beside her , the little boy said to her , " Grandmother ," for that was the name by which she liked that these children should call her --" grandmother , how often you are forced to get up from your spinning - wheel , and to follow the chaises and coaches up that steep hill , to put stones underneath the wheels , to hinder them from rolling back !
The people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny or a penny for doing this , don ' t they ?"
" But it is very hard work for you to go up and down that hill .
You often say that you are tired , and then you know that you cannot spin all that time .
Now if we might go up the hill , and put the stones behind the wheels , you could sit still at your work , and would not the people give us the halfpence ?
I shall never be hurt again , if you will only be so good as to give me the old handle of the broken crutch , grandmother , and the block of wood that lies in the chimney - corner , and that is of no use .
" Take it then , dear ," said the old woman ; " and you ' ll find the handle of the broken crutch under my bed ."
I shall never pinch my fingers again ; my hands , you see , will be safe at the end of this long stick ; and , sister Anne , you need not be at the trouble of carrying any more stones after me up the hill ; we shall never want stones any more .
You may buy some gingerbread for yourselves , or some of those ripe plums that you saw at the fruit - stall the other day , which is just going into Dunstable .
whispered little Anne .
Paul kept his scotcher poised upon his shoulder , and watched eagerly at his station at the bottom of the hill .
Perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are standing here talking to me ."
Anne , who was of a very obliging temper , and who liked to do what she was asked to do , went back to the place where the scotcher lay ; and scarcely had she reached the spot , when she heard the noise of a carriage .
She ran to call her brother , and to their great joy , they now saw four chaises coming towards them .
Oh , Paul , you forgot .
" Why , Paul , you know the fruit - woman said she would give us a dozen plums for a penny .
" If she has so many , and if we like to have so many , to be sure she will ," said Paul , " but I think we should not like to have two hundred and fifty - two dozen of plums ; we could not eat such a number ."
" But we could give some of them to my grandmother ," said Anne .
" But still there would be too many for her , and for us , too ," said Paul , " and when we had eaten the plums , there would be an end to all the pleasure .
said Anne --" a blanket .
I know where blankets can be got .
" You have seen a great many things at Dunstable , brother ."
" Yes , a great many ; but I never saw anything there or anywhere else , that I wished for half so much as I did for the blanket for my grandmother .
" But who gave it to you , Anne ?"
I don ' t know which of them , but I daresay it was the little rosy girl ."
There was a great noise and bustle .
The postillions were rubbing down the horses , or rolling the chaises into the coach - house .
" You ' ve no business here , crowding up the yard .
" Pray give me leave , sir ," said Paul , " to stay a few minutes , to look amongst these chaises for one dark green chaise with red wheels , that has Mr . John Nelson ' s name written upon it ."
One of the baskets stood a little in the way of the entrance .
" Oh , they will be trampled upon !
He pushed them towards the door ; but the basket - woman whispered to them as they went out , " Wait in the street till I come to you ."
" Pray , Mrs . Landlady ," cried this gentleman ' s servant , addressing himself to the landlady , who just then came out of a room where some company were at supper , " Pray , Mrs . Landlady , please to let me have roasted larks for my supper .
" Larks and claret for his supper ," said the basket - woman to herself , as she looked at him from head to foot .
Joe !
cried the landlady , " why don ' t you carry in the sweetmeat - puffs and the tarts here to the company in the best parlour ?"
Pray , what would you have the conscience , I wonder now , to charge me for these here half - dozen little mats to put under my dishes ?"
I should think , if she had been an honest girl , she would have returned it ."
I must see them -- send after them ."
" I marked the guinea ; it was a light one ; the only guinea I had , which I put into my waistcoat pocket this morning ."
The marked guinea appeared .
" And now , my little honest girl ," said the gentleman who had admired her brother ' s scotcher , turning to Anne , " and now tell me who you are , and what you and your brother want or wish for most in the world ."
" She shall have it , then ; and ," continued the gentleman , " I will do something more for you .
said Anne .
" I shall come through Dunstable again in a few months ," added he ; " and I hope to see that you and your scholars are going on well .

One complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch - like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of Labrador , or on the weather side of an ice - island .
In a few minutes , however , he was missed by his shipmates , and being , it seems , for some reason a huge favourite with them , they raised a cry of " Bulkington !
In fact , you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother .
" But wait a bit , Skrimshander ; I ' ve got a carpenter ' s plane there in the bar -- wait , I say , and I ' ll make ye snug enough ."
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall , leaving a little interval between , for my back to settle down in .
" Broke ," said I --" BROKE , do you mean ?"
You and I must understand one another , and that too without delay .
Arter that , Sal said it wouldn ' t do .
" There ," said the landlord , placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash - stand and centre table ; " there , make yourself comfortable now , and good night to ye ."
I then glanced round the room ; and besides the bedstead and centre table , could see no other furniture belonging to the place , but a rude shelf , the four walls , and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale .
I put it on , to try it , and it weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick , and I thought a little damp , as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day .
I sat down on the side of the bed , and commenced thinking about this head - peddling harpooneer , and his door mat .
I then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves .
It ' s only his outside ; a man can be honest in any sort of skin .
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the New Zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag .
Still more , his very legs were marked , as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms .
It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas , and so landed in this Christian country .
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing - song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner .
I sang out , I could not help it now ; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me .
Stammering out something , I knew not what , I rolled away from him against the wall , and then conjured him , whoever or whatever he might be , to keep quiet , and let me get up and light the lamp again .
" Landlord , for God ' s sake , Peter Coffin !"
Watch !
Angels !
" Speak - e !
tell - ee me who - ee be , or dam - me , I kill - e !"
He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way .
What ' s all this fuss I have been making about , thought I to myself -- the man ' s a human being just as I am : he has just as much reason to fear me , as I have to be afraid of him .
I had been cutting up some caper or other -- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless ,-- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o ' clock in the afternoon of the 21st June , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere .
I felt dreadfully .
But there was no help for it , so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor , undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time , and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets .
Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame ; nothing was to be seen , and nothing was to be heard ; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine .
Throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage ' s side , as if it were a hatchet - faced baby .
I was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks .
So , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way .
Enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk - pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when I sallied out for a stroll .
It makes a stranger stare .
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men , all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery .
They are mostly young , of stalwart frames ; fellows who have felled forests , and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale - lance .
Look there !
Here comes another with a sou '- wester and a bombazine cloak .
Not at all .
Still New Bedford is a queer place .
The streets do not run with milk ; nor in the spring - time do they pave them with fresh eggs .
Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that ?
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding ; for , they say , they have reservoirs of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles .
But roses only bloom in summer ; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens .
In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman ' s Chapel , and few are the moody fishermen , shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific , who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot .
I am sure that I did not .
The chaplain had not yet arrived ; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets , with black borders , masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit .
Three of them ran something like the following , but I do not pretend to quote :--
Shaking off the sleet from my ice - glazed hat and jacket , I seated myself near the door , and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me .
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here .
All these things are not without their meanings .
CHAPTER 8
Yes , it was the famous Father Mapple , so called by the whalemen , among whom he was a very great favourite .
When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed .
the sun is breaking through ; the clouds are rolling off -- serenest azure is at hand ."
" Shipmates , this book , containing only four chapters -- four yarns -- is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures .
How billow - like and boisterously grand !
Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a scrutinizing glance .
For it is particularly written , shipmates , as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history , ' that he paid the fare thereof ' ere the craft did sail .
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there , the Captain laughs lowly to himself , and mutters something about the doors of convicts ' cells being never allowed to be locked within .
Then , in that contracted hole , sunk , too , beneath the ship ' s water - line , Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour , when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels ' wards .
But the frightened master comes to him , and shrieks in his dead ear , ' What meanest thou , O , sleeper !
Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry , Jonah staggers to his feet , and stumbling to the deck , grasps a shroud , to look out upon the sea .
In all his cringing attitudes , the God - fugitive is now too plainly known .
What people ?
The eager mariners but ask him who he is , and where from ; whereas , they not only receive an answer to those questions , but likewise another answer to a question not put by them , but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him .
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him ; and the whale shoots - to all his ivory teeth , like so many white bolts , upon his prison .
Shipmates , I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance .
While he was speaking these words , the howling of the shrieking , slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher , who , when describing Jonah ' s sea - storm , seemed tossed by a storm himself .
Yea , woe to him who , as the great Pilot Paul has it , while preaching to others is himself a castaway !"
He said no more , but slowly waving a benediction , covered his face with his hands , and so remained kneeling , till all the people had departed , and he was left alone in the place .
But being now interrupted , he put up the image ; and pretty soon , going to the table , took up a large book there , and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity ; at every fiftieth page -- as I fancied -- stopping a moment , looking vacantly around him , and giving utterance to a long - drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment .
All this struck me as mighty singular ; yet , upon second thoughts , there was something almost sublime in it .
If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan ' s breast , this pleasant , genial smoke we had , soon thawed it out , and left us cronies .
Do you suppose now , Ishmael , that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth -- pagans and all included -- can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood ?
And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me ?
Consequently , I must then unite with him in his ; ergo , I must turn idolator .
But if , like Queequeg and me in the bed , the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled , why then , indeed , in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm .
For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air .
Upon opening my eyes then , and coming out of my own pleasant and self - created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve - o ' clock - at - night , I experienced a disagreeable revulsion .
CHAPTER 12
When a new - hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout , followed by the nibbling goats , as if he were a green sapling ; even then , in Queequeg ' s ambitious soul , lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two .
But the ship , having her full complement of seamen , spurned his suit ; and not all the King his father ' s influence could prevail .
the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked ; infinitely more so , than all his father ' s heathens .
And thus an old idolator at heart , he yet lived among these Christians , wore their clothes , and tried to talk their gibberish .
He answered no , not yet ; and added that he was fearful Christianity , or rather Christians , had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him .
His story being ended with his pipe ' s last dying puff , Queequeg embraced me , pressed his forehead against mine , and blowing out the light , we rolled over from each other , this way and that , and very soon were sleeping .
But we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs .
To this , in substance , he replied , that though what I hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal combat , and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales .
" Why ," said I , " Queequeg , you might have known better than that , one would think .
The people of his island of Rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held .
At last , passage paid , and luggage safe , we stood on board the schooner .
At the same foam - fountain , Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me .
But it so happened just then , that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye .
The prodigious strain upon the main - sail had parted the weather - sheet , and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side , completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck .
It flew from right to left , and back again , almost in one ticking of a watch , and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters .
I looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved .
The greenhorn had gone down .
A few minutes more , and he rose again , one arm still striking out , and with the other dragging a lifeless form .
All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump ; the captain begged his pardon .
Look at it -- a mere hillock , and elbow of sand ; all beach , without a background .
With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters .
They resolved to follow in the same direction .
What wonder , then , that these Nantucketers , born on a beach , should take to the sea for a livelihood !
They first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand ; grown bolder , they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more experienced , they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; and at last , launching a navy of great ships on the sea , explored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it ; peeped in at Behring ' s Straits ; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood ; most monstrous and most mountainous !
That Himmalehan , salt - sea Mastodon , clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power , that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults !
Merchant ships are but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; even pirates and privateers , though following the sea as highwaymen the road , they but plunder other ships , other fragments of the land like themselves , without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself .
THERE is his home ; THERE lies his business , which a Noah ' s flood would not interrupt , though it overwhelmed all the millions in China .
With the landless gull , that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows ; so at nightfall , the Nantucketer , out of sight of land , furls his sails , and lays him to his rest , while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales .
In short , he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot - luck at the Try Pots .
" What ' s that about Cods , ma ' am ?"
said I , with much politeness .
" Clam or Cod ?"
" A clam for supper ?
Hussey ?"
Oh , sweet friends !
hearken to me .
" But look , Queequeg , ain ' t that a live eel in your bowl ?
So , Mr . Queequeg " ( for she had learned his name ), " I will just take this here iron , and keep it for you till morning .
But to my surprise and no small concern , Queequeg now gave me to understand , that he had been diligently consulting Yojo -- the name of his black little god -- and Yojo had told him two or three times over , and strongly insisted upon it everyway , that instead of our going together among the whaling - fleet in harbor , and in concert selecting our craft ; instead of this , I say , Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me , inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us ; and , in order to do so , had already pitched upon a vessel , which , if left to myself , I , Ishmael , should infallibly light upon , for all the world as though it had turned out by chance ; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself , for the present irrespective of Queequeg .
She was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old - fashioned claw - footed look about her .
Long seasoned and weather - stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans , her old hull ' s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier ' s , who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia .
But to all these her old antiquities , were added new and marvellous features , pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed .
All noble things are touched with that .
He was seated on an old - fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed .
I ' ve been several voyages in the merchant service , and I think that --"
man , what makes thee want to go a whaling , eh ?-- it looks a little suspicious , don ' t it , eh ?-- Hast not been a pirate , hast thou ?-- Didst not rob thy last Captain , didst thou ?-- Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea ?"
" Aye , aye , I thought so .
I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself ."
Now then , thou not only wantest to go a - whaling , to find out by experience what whaling is , but ye also want to go in order to see the world ?
For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request , not knowing exactly how to take it , whether humorously or in earnest .
Going forward and glancing over the weather bow , I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood - tide , was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean .
" Well , what ' s the report ?"
" Well , what does thou think then of seeing the world ?
People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels , the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest .
But , as yet we have not to do with such an one , but with quite another ; and still a man , who , if indeed peculiar , it only results again from another phase of the Quaker , modified by individual circumstances .
But unlike Captain Peleg -- who cared not a rush for what are called serious things , and indeed deemed those self - same serious things the veriest of all trifles -- Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism , but all his subsequent ocean life , and the sight of many unclad , lovely island creatures , round the Horn -- all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot , had not so much as altered one angle of his vest .
For a pious man , especially for a Quaker , he was certainly rather hard - hearted , to say the least .
" He ' ll do ," said Bildad , eyeing me , and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible .
the seven hundred and seventy - seventh !
" Fiery pit !
As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad , but with a marvellous oblique , sliding celerity , Bildad for that time eluded him .
" Whew !"
However , it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands .
It ' s all right enough ; thou art shipped ."
He ' s a queer man , Captain Ahab -- so some think -- but a good one .
His lance !
aye , the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle !
" And a very vile one .
So good - bye to thee -- and wrong not Captain Ahab , because he happens to have a wicked name .
CHAPTER 17
I say , we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things , and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals , pagans and what not , because of their half - crazy conceits on these subjects .
There was Queequeg , now , certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan ;-- but what of that ?
I had allowed him such abundant time ; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit .
Something must have happened .
" La !
-- and with these cries , she ran towards the kitchen , I following .
Mrs . Hussey soon appeared , with a mustard - pot in one hand and a vinegar - cruet in the other , having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors , and scolding her little black boy meantime .
cried I , " which way to it ?
he ' s had a stroke ; depend upon it !"
Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs , she glanced in , and returning , told me that Queequeg ' s harpoon was missing .
Where ' s that girl ?-- there , Betty , go to Snarles the Painter , and tell him to paint me a sign , with --" no suicides permitted here , and no smoking in the parlor ;"-- might as well kill both birds at once .
But avast !"
With a prodigious noise the door flew open , and the knob slamming against the wall , sent the plaster to the ceiling ; and there , good heavens !
there sat Queequeg , altogether cool and self - collected ; right in the middle of the room ; squatting on his hams , and holding Yojo on top of his head .
There he sat ; and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in the slightest way .
It can ' t last for ever , thank God , and his Ramadan only comes once a year ; and I don ' t believe it ' s very punctual then .
But not a word did he reply .
But previous to turning in , I took my heavy bearskin jacket , and threw it over him , as it promised to be a very cold night ; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on .
Because , in the first place , he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject , unless considered from his own point of view ; and , in the second place , he did not more than one third understand me , couch my ideas simply as I would ; and , finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did .
that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman ' s meeting - house ?"
" I don ' t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting ," said I ; " all I know is , that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church .
He is a deacon himself , Queequeg is ."
Finding myself thus hard pushed , I replied .
well , spose him one whale eye , well , den !"
and taking sharp aim at it , he darted the iron right over old Bildad ' s broad brim , clean across the ship ' s decks , and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight .
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg , and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad - skirted drab coat , took out a bundle of tracts , and selecting one entitled " The Latter Day Coming ; or No Time to Lose ," placed it in Queequeg ' s hands , and then grasping them and the book with both his , looked earnestly into his eyes , and said , " Son of darkness , I must do my duty by thee ; I am part owner of this ship , and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew ; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways , which I sadly fear , I beseech thee , remain not for aye a Belial bondsman .
steer clear of the fiery pit !"
Thou beliest thine own heart , Peleg .
With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side ; and every sea breaking over us , fore and aft .
" No matter though , I know many chaps that hav ' n ' t got any ,-- good luck to ' em ; and they are all the better off for it .
A soul ' s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon ."
" Queequeg ," said I , " let ' s go ; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere ; he ' s talking about something and somebody we don ' t know ."
" Who ' s Old Thunder ?"
said I , again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner .
" No , we hav ' n ' t .
He ' s sick they say , but is getting better , and will be all right again before long ."
" Look ye ; when Captain Ahab is all right , then this left arm of mine will be all right ; not before ."
And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage , according to the prophecy .
Who knows it ?
With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod , the beggar - like stranger stood a moment , as if in a troubled reverie ; then starting a little , turned and said :--" Ye ' ve shipped , have ye ?
Well , well , what ' s signed , is signed ; and what ' s to be , will be ; and then again , perhaps it won ' t be , after all .
" Come along , Queequeg , let ' s leave this crazy man .
But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards , when chancing to turn a corner , and looking back as I did so , who should be seen but Elijah following us , though at a distance .
This circumstance , coupled with his ambiguous , half - hinting , half - revealing , shrouded sort of talk , now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half - apprehensions , and all connected with the Pequod ; and Captain Ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; and the Cape Horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what Captain Peleg had said of him , when I left the ship the day previous ; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig ; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a hundred other shadowy things .
But Elijah passed on , without seeming to notice us .
CHAPTER 20
At the period of our arrival at the Island , the heaviest storage of the Pequod had been almost completed ; comprising her beef , bread , water , fuel , and iron hoops and staves .
At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward ' s pantry ; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate ' s desk , where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one ' s rheumatic back .
Never did any woman better deserve her name , which was Charity -- Aunt Charity , as everybody called her .
Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward .
As for Bildad , he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed , and at every fresh arrival , down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper .
" Avast !"
Coming back afore breakfast ?"
Struck by this plain matter - of - fact question , I answered , saying , " Yes , I thought I did see four or five men ; but it was too dim to be sure ."
Once more we quitted him ; but once more he came softly after us ; and touching my shoulder again , said , " See if you can find ' em now , will ye ?
" Find who ?"
Shan ' t see ye again very soon , I guess ; unless it ' s before the Grand Jury ."
The cabin entrance was locked within ; the hatches were all on , and lumbered with coils of rigging .
He put his hand upon the sleeper ' s rear , as though feeling if it was soft enough ; and then , without more ado , sat quietly down there .
Look , he ' ll twitch you off soon .
I sat at the feet .
Besides , it was very convenient on an excursion ; much better than those garden - chairs which are convertible into walking - sticks ; upon occasion , a chief calling his attendant , and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree , perhaps in some damp marshy place .
The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole , it began to tell upon him .
" Holloa !"
She sails to - day .
" Who but him indeed ?"
I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab , when we heard a noise on deck .
" Holloa !
How now !
But then , the idea was , that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh , and steering her well out to sea .
But there was not much chance to think over the matter , for Captain Peleg was now all alive .
It was a short , cold Christmas ; and as the short northern day merged into night , we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean , whose freezing spray cased us in ice , as in polished armor .
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then .
Careful , careful !-- come , Bildad , boy -- say your last .
Don ' t forget your prayers , either .
Oh !
Don ' t keep that cheese too long down in the hold , Mr . Starbuck ; it ' ll spoil .
The Lee Shore .
Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable ; deep memories yield no epitaphs ; this six - inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington .
who would craven crawl to land !
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society , it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits , were he presented to the company as a harpooneer , say ; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials S . W . F .
Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us whalemen , is this : they think that , at best , our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business ; and that when actively engaged therein , we are surrounded by all manner of defilements .
And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier ' s profession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery , would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale ' s vast tail , fanning into eddies the air over his head .
and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $ 7 , 000 , 000 .
But this is not the half ; look again .
For many years past the whale - ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth .
All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages , those things were but the life - time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers .
Often , adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to , these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship ' s common log .
Ah , the world !
Moreover , in the infancy of the first Australian settlement , the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale - ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters .
The whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler , you will say .
Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan ?
Who , but Edmund Burke !
No more !
in my desk , then here I prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling ; for a whale - ship was my Yale College and my Harvard .
CHAPTER 25
It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens , even modern ones , a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through .
How they use the salt , precisely -- who knows ?
The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck , a native of Nantucket , and a Quaker by descent .
He was a long , earnest man , and though born on an icy coast , seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes , his flesh being hard as twice - baked biscuit .
He was by no means ill - looking ; quite the contrary .
Outward portents and inward presentiments were his .
But we shall ere long see what that word " careful " precisely means when used by a man like Stubb , or almost any other whale hunter .
What doom was his own father ' s ?
And brave as he might be , it was that sort of bravery chiefly , visible in some intrepid men , which , while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas , or winds , or whales , or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world , yet cannot withstand those more terrific , because more spiritual terrors , which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man .
who didst not refuse to the swart convict , Bunyan , the pale , poetic pearl ; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold , the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes ; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles ; who didst hurl him upon a war - horse ; who didst thunder him higher than a throne !
A happy - go - lucky ; neither craven nor valiant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air ; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase , toiling away , calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year .
He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat , as an old stage - driver is about the snugness of his box .
The third mate was Flask , a native of Tisbury , in Martha ' s Vineyard .
Tashtego was Stubb the second mate ' s squire .
Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo , a gigantic , coal - black negro - savage , with a lion - like tread -- an Ahasuerus to behold .
In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast .
Poor Alabama boy !
Yes , their supreme lord and dictator was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin .
But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness -- to call it so -- which I felt , yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship , it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions .
But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship , the mates , which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings , and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage .
He looked like a man cut away from the stake , when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them , or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness .
" Aye , he was dismasted off Japan ," said the old Gay - Head Indian once ; " but like his dismasted craft , he shipped another mast without coming home for it .
He has a quiver of ' em ."
I was struck with the singular posture he maintained .
As the sky grew less gloomy ; indeed , began to grow a little genial , he became still less and less a recluse ; as if , when the ship had sailed from home , nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded .
More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile .
CHAPTER 29
And all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on Ahab ' s texture .
Some considering touch of humanity was in him ; for at times like these , he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter - deck ; because to his wearied mates , seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel , such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step , that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks .
" I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it ," muttered Stubb , as he found himself descending the cabin - scuttle .
Stop , Stubb ; somehow , now , I don ' t well know whether to go back and strike him , or -- what ' s that ?-- down here on my knees and pray for him ?
Yes , that was the thought coming up in me ; but it would be the first time I ever DID pray .
But there ' s no telling , it ' s the old game -- Here goes for a snooze .
Think not , is my eleventh commandment ; and sleep when you can , is my twelfth -- So here goes again .
he called me ten times a donkey , and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT !
What the devil ' s the matter with me ?
how ?-- but the only way ' s to stash it ; so here goes to hammock again ; and in the morning , I ' ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight ."
Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck , he sat and smoked .
It ' s not a real leg , only a false leg .'
And thinks I to myself all the while , mind , while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid -- so confoundedly contradictory was it all , all the while , I say , I was thinking to myself , ' what ' s his leg now , but a cane -- a whalebone cane .
But this insult is whittled down to a point only .'
' What am I about ?'
By the lord , Flask , I had no sooner said that , than he turned round his stern to me , bent over , and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout -- what do you think , I saw ?-- why thunder alive , man , his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes , with the points out .
' Halloa ,' says I , ' what ' s the matter now , old fellow ?'
It ' s an honour ; I consider it an honour .
With that , he all of a sudden seemed somehow , in some queer fashion , to swim off into the air .
Look sharp , all of ye !
" What do you think of that now , Flask ?
It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera , that I would now fain put before you .
Thus speak of the whale , the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and Lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy .
Run over a few :-- The Authors of the Bible ; Aristotle ; Pliny ; Aldrovandi ; Sir Thomas Browne ; Gesner ; Ray ; Linnaeus ; Rondeletius ; Willoughby ; Green ; Artedi ; Sibbald ; Brisson ; Marten ; Lacepede ; Bonneterre ; Desmarest ; Baron Cuvier ; Frederick Cuvier ; John Hunter ; Owen ; Scoresby ; Beale ; Bennett ; J . Ross Browne ; the Author of Miriam Coffin ; Olmstead ; and the Rev .
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written , the above cited extracts will show .
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning .
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales .
Those books are Beale ' s and Bennett ' s ; both in their time surgeons to English South - Sea whale - ships , and both exact and reliable men .
As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature .
As no better man advances to take this matter in hand , I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors .
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species , or -- in this place at least -- to much of any description .
I am the architect , not the builder .
What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan !
There are some preliminaries to settle .
First : The uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish .
This fundamental thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish .
But in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded .
Next : how shall we define the whale , by his obvious externals , so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come ?
* Hence , all the smaller , spouting , and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground - plan of Cetology .
Now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host .
* I am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs ( Pig - fish and Sow - fish of the Coffins of Nantucket ) are included by many naturalists among the whales .
the OCTAVO WHALE ; III .
Among these I here include the following chapters :-- I .
BOOK I .
( FOLIO ), CHAPTER I .
Some centuries ago , when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale .
Among the fishermen , he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles : The Whale ; the Greenland Whale ; the Black Whale ; the Great Whale ; the True Whale ; the Right Whale .
The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to elucidating the sperm whale .
BOOK I .
( FOLIO ), CHAPTER III .
His grand distinguishing feature , the fin , from which he derives his name , is often a conspicuous object .
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface .
When the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon - like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour - lines graved on it .
In connection with this appellative of " Whalebone whales ," it is of great importance to mention , that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales , yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan , founded upon either his baleen , or hump , or fin , or teeth ; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions , which the whale , in his kinds , presents .
In various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis .
BOOK I .
I can say nothing more that is true of ye , nor can the oldest Nantucketer .
Because , while the whales of this order , though smaller than those of the former order , nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure , yet the bookbinder ' s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume , but the Octavo volume does .
( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER I .
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale .
My own opinion is , that however this one - sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale -- however that may be -- it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets .
An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester , on bended knees , did likewise present to her highness another horn , pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature .
Thus ends BOOK II .
( OCTAVO ), and begins BOOK III .
The Mealy - mouthed Porpoise .
BOOK III .
I call him thus , because he always swims in hilarious shoals , which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth - of - July crowd .
A well - fed , plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil .
( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER III .
He has no fins on his back ( most other porpoises have ), he has a lovely tail , and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue .
His oil is much like that of the common porpoise .
The Specksynder .
Concerning the officers of the whale - craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship - board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale - fleet .
CHAPTER 34
It is noon ; and Dough - Boy , the steward , thrusting his pale loaf - of - bread face from the cabin - scuttle , announces dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee quarter - boat , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth , medallion - shaped tablet , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg .
But presently , catching hold of the mizen shrouds , he swings himself to the deck , and in an even , unexhilarated voice , saying , " Dinner , Mr . Starbuck ," disappears into the cabin .
To have been Belshazzar , King of Babylon ; and to have been Belshazzar , not haughtily but courteously , therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur .
It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding .
In his own proper turn , each officer waited to be served .
I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation , even upon so neutral a topic as the weather .
And had Flask helped himself , the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it .
Besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask ' s official capacity , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain ample vengeance , was to go aft at dinner - time , and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky - light , sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab .
Now , Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod ' s cabin .
After their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward .
They made a sort of temporary servants ' hall of the high and mighty cabin .
And if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop - skip - and - jump , then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon - wise .
And once Daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , assisted Dough - Boy ' s memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while Tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him .
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab , and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages , Dough - Boy ' s whole life was one continual lip - quiver .
But for all this , the great negro was wonderfully abstemious , not to say dainty .
How could he forget that in his Island days , Queequeg , for one , must certainly have been guilty of some murderous , convivial indiscretions .
For when they did enter it , it was something as a street - door enters a house ; turning inwards for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , residing in the open air .
In Saint Stylites , the famous Christian hermit of old times , who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander - of - mast - heads ; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post .
The three mast - heads are kept manned from sun - rise to sun - set ; the seamen taking their regular turns ( as at the helm ), and relieving each other every two hours .
In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast - head ; nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful .
The tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor .
And it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness , or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling , such as pertains to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a sentry box , a pulpit , a coach , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves .
Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t ' gallant - mast , where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks ( almost peculiar to whalemen ) called the t ' gallant cross - trees .
In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet , entitled " A Voyage among the Icebergs , in quest of the Greenland Whale , and incidentally for the re - discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland ;" in this admirable volume , all standers of mast - heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented CROW ' S - NEST of the Glacier , which was the name of Captain Sleet ' s good craft .
He called it the SLEET ' S CROW ' S - NEST , in honour of himself ; he being the original inventor and patentee , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names ( we fathers being the original inventors and patentees ), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget .
In shape , the Sleet ' s crow ' s - nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a movable side - screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale .
Though , upon the whole , I greatly admire and even love the brave , the honest , and learned Captain ; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case - bottle , seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been , while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird ' s nest within three or four perches of the pole .
Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent - minded young philosophers to task , upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient " interest " in the voyage ; half - hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition , as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise .
CHAPTER 36
It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe , that one morning shortly after breakfast , Ahab , as was his wont , ascended the cabin - gangway to the deck .
Soon his steady , ivory stride was heard , as to and fro he paced his old rounds , upon planks so familiar to his tread , that they were all over dented , like geological stones , with the peculiar mark of his walk .
And , so full of his thought was Ahab , that at every uniform turn that he made , now at the main - mast and now at the binnacle , you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned , and pace in him as he paced ; so completely possessing him , indeed , that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement .
" D ' ye mark him , Flask ?"
" Good !"
More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving , grew the countenance of the old man at every shout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions .
-- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun --" it is a sixteen dollar piece , men .
D ' ye see it ?
While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket , as if to heighten its lustre , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him .
Receiving the top - maul from Starbuck , he advanced towards the main - mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand , exhibiting the gold with the other , and with a high raised voice exclaiming : " Whosoever of ye raises me a white - headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw ; whosoever of ye raises me that white - headed whale , with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke -- look ye , whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale , he shall have this gold ounce , my boys !"
cried the seamen , as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast .
" Moby Dick ?"
good many iron in him hide , too , Captain ," cried Queequeg disjointedly , " all twiske - tee be - twisk , like him -- him --" faltering hard for a word , and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle --" like him -- him --"
Death and devils !
" Who told thee that ?"
Then tossing both arms , with measureless imprecations he shouted out : " Aye , aye !
I think ye do look brave ."
go draw the great measure of grog .
" Hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer .
If man will strike , strike through the mask !
So , so ; thou reddenest and palest ; my heat has melted thee to anger - glow .
The crew , man , the crew !
why stay ye not when ye come ?
Receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons .
Well done ; almost drained .
Hand it me .
For did ye three but once take the full - forced shock , then mine own electric thing , THAT had perhaps expired from out me .
I do not order ye ; ye will it .
Cut your seizings and draw the poles , ye harpooneers !"
So , so ; now , ye cup - bearers , advance .
God hunt us all , if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death !"
time was , when as the sunrise nobly spurred me , so the sunset soothed .
( WAVING HIS HAND , HE MOVES FROM THE WINDOW .)
I thought to find one stubborn , at the least ; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels , and they revolve .
Or , if you will , like so many ant - hills of powder , they all stand before me ; and I their match .
Oh , hard !
That wild madness that ' s only calm to comprehend itself !
I lost this leg .
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer .
man has ye there .
Swerve me ?
The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails , whereon my soul is grooved to run .
My soul is more than matched ; she ' s overmanned ; and by a madman !
Who ' s over him , he cries ;-- aye , he would be a democrat to all above ; look , how he lords it over all below !

TASHTEGO ( WITH A WHIFF ).
Humph !
A row !
A ring , a ring !
Jollies ?
Lord help such jollies !
But there they go , all cursing , and here I don ' t .
Hold on hard !
I , Ishmael , was one of that crew ; my shouts had gone up with the rest ; my oath had been welded with theirs ; and stronger I shouted , and more did I hammer and clinch my oath , because of the dread in my soul .
But at length , such calamities did ensue in these assaults -- not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles , broken limbs , or devouring amputations -- but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disastrous repulses , all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come .
No wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half - formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears .
And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists -- Olassen and Povelson -- declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood .
These were his prominent features ; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless , uncharted seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him .
But though similar disasters , however little bruited ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the White Whale ' s infernal aforethought of ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent .
His three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line - knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an Arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom - deep life of the whale .
No turbaned Turk , no hired Venetian or Malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice .
Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing .
That before living agent , now became the living instrument .
But vain to popularize profundities , and all truth is profound .
Nor is it so very unlikely , that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage , on account of such dark symptoms , the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit , that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge , for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales .
Gnawed within and scorched without , with the infixed , unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea ; such an one , could he be found , would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes .
The subterranean miner that works in us all , how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting , muffled sound of his pick ?
CHAPTER 42
But how can I hope to explain myself here ; and yet , in some dim , random way , explain myself I must , else all these chapters might be naught .
This elusive quality it is , which causes the thought of whiteness , when divorced from more kindly associations , and coupled with any object terrible in itself , to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds .
This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish .
At intervals , it arched forth its vast archangel wings , as if to embrace some holy ark .
Goney !
But I doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing - folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim !
Therefore , in his other moods , symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness , no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul .
To analyse it , would seem impossible .
Why to the man of untutored ideality , who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day , does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long , dreary , speechless processions of slow - pacing pilgrims , down - cast and hooded with new - fallen snow ?
Or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ?
What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples .
But thou sayest , methinks that white - lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul ; thou surrenderest to a hypo , Ishmael .
Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe , and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ?
Pass along that return bucket ."
Hark ye , Cabaco , there is somebody down in the after - hold that has not yet been seen on deck ; and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too .
On this hint , attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale .
In general , the same remark , only within a less wide limit , applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured , aged sperm whales .
For there and then , for several consecutive years , Moby Dick had been periodically descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its annual round , loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac .
Yet the premature hour of the Pequod ' s sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things .
And here , his mad mind would run on in a breathless race ; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him ; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength .
The latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral .
God help thee , old man , thy thoughts have created a creature in thee ; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus ; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever ; that vulture the very creature he creates .
First : I have personally known three instances where a whale , after receiving a harpoon , has effected a complete escape ; and , after an interval ( in one instance of three years ), has been again struck by the same hand , and slain ; when the two irons , both marked by the same private cypher , have been taken from the body .
King of Japan , whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow - white cross against the sky ?
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here , to make mention of one or two other things , which to me seem important , as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale , more especially the catastrophe .
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world , that without some hints touching the plain facts , historical and otherwise , of the fishery , they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable , or still worse and more detestable , a hideous and intolerable allegory .
In fact , did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea ?
For God ' s sake , be economical with your lamps and candles !
That point is this : The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful , knowing , and judiciously malicious , as with direct aforethought to stave in , utterly destroy , and sink a large ship ; and what is more , the Sperm Whale HAS done it .
Ere long , several of the whales were wounded ; when , suddenly , a very large whale escaping from the boats , issued from the shoal , and bore directly down upon the ship .
After the severest exposure , part of the crew reached the land in their boats .
* The following are extracts from Chace ' s narrative : " Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of which , according to their direction , were calculated to do us the most injury , by being made ahead , and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock ; to effect which , the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary .
Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright ?
I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff .
And , indeed , the shock was so sudden and violent , that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amazement was a little over , we cast the lead , and sounded , but found no ground .
Now , as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles , hence a sperm whale could , by the same route , pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis .
CHAPTER 46
Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally .
This vigilance was not long without reward .
So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene , and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air , that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self .
she blows !
" There go flukes !"
cried Ahab .
The ship was now kept away from the wind , and she went gently rolling before it .
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale .
Didn ' t I hear ' em in the hold ?
What say ye , Cabaco ?
" Pull , pull , my fine hearts - alive ; pull , my children ; pull , my little ones ," drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew , some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness .
pull , can ' t ye ?
pull , and start your eyes out !
whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle ; " every mother ' s son of ye draw his knife , and pull with the blade between his teeth .
but never mind , Mr . Stubb , all for the best .
The White Whale ' s at the bottom of it .
Meanwhile Stubb , the third mate , betrayed no such far - gazing solicitudes .
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling , and partially beneath a thin layer of water , also , the whales were swimming .
Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers , now harsh with command , now soft with entreaty .
O Lord , Lord !
" Look at that chap now ," philosophically drawled Stubb , who , with his unlighted short pipe , mechanically retained between his teeth , at a short distance , followed after --" He ' s got fits , that Flask has .
Fits ?
Merrily , merrily , hearts - alive .
But what the devil are you hurrying about ?
The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible , owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud - shadows flung upon the sea .
The boats were pulled more apart ; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward .
Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row - locks .
" Give way , men ," whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; " there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes .
There ' s white water again !-- close to !
Spring !"
A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of Queequeg .
The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter - skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall .
In vain we hailed the other boats ; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm .
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat .
Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear .
The sound came nearer and nearer ; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge , vague form .
There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke , though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns , and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody ' s expense but his own .
" Certain .
" Can ' t you twist that smaller ?"
Ha , ha !
the whale would give them squint for squint , mind that !"
Considering , therefore , that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep , were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life ; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat -- oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings ; considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck ' s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall , and considering that Starbuck , notwithstanding , was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery ; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck ' s boat ; and finally considering in what a devil ' s chase I was implicated , touching the White Whale : taking all things together , I say , I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will .
Now then , thought I , unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock , here goes for a cool , collected dive at death and destruction , and the devil fetch the hindmost .
CHAPTER 50
cried Stubb ; " if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug - hole with my timber toe .
he ' s a wonderful old man !"
That would disable him ; but he has one knee , and good part of the other left , you know ."
" I don ' t know that , my little man ; I never yet saw him kneel ."
Therefore he had not solicited a boat ' s crew from them , nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head .
Besides , now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash - holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers ; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks , bits of wreck , oars , whaleboats , canoes , blown - off Japanese junks , and what not ; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain , and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle .
The Spirit - Spout .
Days , weeks passed , and under easy sail , the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising - grounds ; that off the Azores ; off the Cape de Verdes ; on the Plate ( so called ), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata ; and the Carrol Ground , an unstaked , watery locality , southerly from St . Helena .
Fedallah first descried this jet .
On life and death this old man walked .
This midnight - spout had almost grown a forgotten thing , when , some days after , lo !
These temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn - like prow .
But , at last , when turning to the eastward , the Cape winds began howling around us , and we rose and fell upon the long , troubled seas that are there ; when the ivory - tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast , and gored the dark waves in her madness , till , like showers of silver chips , the foam - flakes flew over her bulwarks ; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away , but gave place to sights more dismal than before .
So , with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole , and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud , Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward , while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together .
Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock .
For , as it eventually turned out , he cared not to consort , even for five minutes , with any stranger captain , except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought .
And in return for that courtesy , the outward - bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising - ground to which she may be destined , a thing of the utmost importance to her .
But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist , it would be hard to say , seeing that the Yankees in one day , collectively , kill more whales than all the English , collectively , in ten years .
As for Men - of - War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right - down hearty good - will and brotherly love about it at all .
As touching Slave - ships meeting , why , they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each other as soon as possible .
In a pirate , man - of - war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner ' s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons .
High times indeed , if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs .
For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town - Ho himself .
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship , the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record .
One morning upon handling the pumps , according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common .
"' Lakeman !-- Buffalo !
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic , for example , some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it ; though of a still , sleepy night , should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect , the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it , on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom .
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters , some really landless latitude , that her captain begins to feel a little anxious .
Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen .
"' Damn your eyes !
Now what cozening fiend it was , gentlemen , that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state , I know not ; but so it happened .
But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys , if boys there be aboard .
Oh !
But ashore , all this effeminacy is dashed .
The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily - ribboned hat betoken his grand features .
In sum , gentlemen , what the wildness of this canal life is , is emphatically evinced by this ; that our wild whale - fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates , and that scarce any race of mankind , except Sydney men , are so much distrusted by our whaling captains .
I see !'
Turn to !'
Captain , by God , look to yourself ; say the word ; don ' t be a fool ; forget it all ; we are ready to turn to ; treat us decently , and we ' re your men ; but we won ' t be flogged .'
Then opening the slide a little , the Captain whispered something down the crack , closed it , and turned the key upon them -- ten in number -- leaving on deck some twenty or more , who thus far had remained neutral .
Emboldened by this , the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged .
"' Shut us up again , will ye !'
cried Steelkilt .
That was the last night he should spend in that den .
But to this their leader as fiercely objected , reserving that priority for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time .
But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle chemistry of villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and gagged him with cords ; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight .
But all these were collared , and dragged along the deck like dead cattle ; and , side by side , were seized up into the mizzen rigging , like three quarters of meat , and there they hung till morning .
"' My wrist is sprained with ye !'
" For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws , and then painfully twisting round his head , said in a sort of hiss , ' What I say is this -- and mind it well -- if you flog me , I murder you !'
then see how ye frighten me '-- and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike .
Still , no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest .
said a shipmate .
"' Why not ?
Do you think he won ' t do me a turn , when it ' s to help himself in the end , shipmate ?'
"' Moby Dick !'
"' The chicha !
All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared .
But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated , both by night and by day , and so extreme was the hard work they underwent , that upon the vessel being ready again for sea , they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel .
" On the fourth day of the sail , a large canoe was descried , which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals .
cried the captain .
Let me board you a moment -- I come in peace .'
"' Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn , gentlemen ?'
"' Nay ,' said Don Sebastian ; ' but I know a worthy priest near by , who will quickly procure one for me .
this may grow too serious .'
CHAPTER 55
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda , all the trades and pursuits , every conceivable avocation of man , were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being .
Look at that popular work " Goldsmith ' s Animated Nature ."
All these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale ( that is to say , the Right whale ), even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature .
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars .
But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form .
Though Jeremy Bentham ' s skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly - browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy ' s other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan ' s articulated bones .
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like .
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J . Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved .
The half - emptied line - tub floats on the whitened sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene .
Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs , shell - fish , and other sea candies and maccaroni , which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back .
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself " H .
Durand ."
From the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen .
On Tower - hill , as you go down to the London docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar ( or KEDGER , as the sailors say ) holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg .
Your true whale - hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois .
An ancient Hawaiian war - club or spear - paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon .
Steering north - eastward from the Crozetts , we fell in with vast meadows of brit , the minute , yellow substance , upon which the Right Whale largely feeds .
For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea ; and though taking a broad general view of the thing , this may very well be ; yet coming to specialties , where , for example , does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog ?
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off - spring ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned .
Push not off from that isle , thou canst never return !
CHAPTER 59
Thus glistening for a moment , as slowly it subsided , and sank .
thought Daggoo .
Again the phantom went down , but on re - appearing once more , with a stiletto - like cry that startled every man from his nod , the negro yelled out --" There !
there she breaches !
Bare - headed in the sultry sun , Ahab stood on the bowsprit , and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman , cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo .
Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab , so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued ; however this was , or whether his eagerness betrayed him ; whichever way it might have been , no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass , than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering .
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed --" Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost !"
Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness .
But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it .
The whale - line is only two - thirds of an inch in thickness .
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons .
In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs .
There is some advantage in this ; because these twin - tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the American tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half - inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale - boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one .
But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last .
So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats , we swiftly but silently paddled along ; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set .
Presently , as we thus glided in chase , the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up .
was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb ' s producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted .
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed , the whale rose again , and being now in advance of the smoker ' s boat , and much nearer to it than to any of the others , Stubb counted upon the honour of the capture .
It was obvious , now , that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers .
Don ' t hurry yourselves ; take plenty of time -- but start her ; start her like thunder - claps , that ' s all ," cried Stubb , spluttering out the smoke as he spoke .
" Wet the line !
" Pull up !-- close to !"
A word concerning an incident in the last chapter .
Now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet .
He now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale .
No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood - vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !
It is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat .
The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman .
Consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him .
And now , as we eighteen men with our thirty - six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved .
* A little item may as well be related here .
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes .
The mark they thus leave on the whale , may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw .
he cried at length , widening his legs still further , as if to form a more secure base for his supper ; and , at the same time darting his fork into the dish , as if stabbing with his lance ; " cook , you cook !-- sail this way , cook !"
Don ' t I always say that to be good , a whale - steak must be tough ?
you must stop dat dam racket !"
Talk to ' em gentlemanly ."
Don ' t be tearin ' de blubber out your neighbour ' s mout , I say .
cried Stubb , " that ' s Christianity ; go on ."
" Cussed fellow - critters !
"' Bout ninety , dey say ," he gloomily muttered .
" Born in a ferry - boat !
" Come back here , cook ;-- here , hand me those tongs ;-- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ?
said Stubb .
" Where do you expect to go to , cook ?"
" Avast !
But don ' t you know the higher you climb , the colder it gets ?
Drop your tongs , cook , and hear my orders .
What !
aloft !-- that ' s it -- now you have it .
" All ' dention ," said the old black , with both hands placed as desired , vainly wriggling his grizzled head , as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time .
" Well then , cook , you see this whale - steak of yours was so very bad , that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible ; you see that , don ' t you ?
And now to - morrow , cook , when we are cutting in the fish , be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins ; have them put in pickle .
D ' ye hear ?
make a bow before you go .-- Avast heaving again !
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them .
The fact is , that among his hunters at least , the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish , were there not so much of him ; but when you come to sit down before a meat - pie nearly one hundred feet long , it takes away your appetite .
He is the great prize ox of the sea , too fat to be delicately good .
But the spermaceti itself , how bland and creamy that is ; like the transparent , half - jellied , white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth , yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter .
In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship - biscuit into the huge oil - pots and let them fry there awhile .
Many a good supper have I thus made .
expression .
Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal ' s jaw ?
And what do you pick your teeth with , after devouring that fat goose ?
But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts , the marksmen could not always hit their mark ; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe .
They viciously snapped , not only at each other ' s disembowelments , but like flexible bows , bent round , and bit their own ; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth , to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound .
It was a Saturday night , and such a Sabbath as followed !
You would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods .
In the first place , the enormous cutting tackles , among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green , and which no single man can possibly lift -- this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main - top and firmly lashed to the lower mast - head , the strongest point anywhere above a ship ' s deck .
This done , a broad , semicircular line is cut round the hole , the hook is inserted , and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus , now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass .
Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange , so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it .
Into this hole , the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber , in order to prepare for what follows .
Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket - piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents .
At any rate , it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles , as you may say .
Nor is this all .
In some instances , to the quick , observant eye , those linear marks , as in a veritable engraving , but afford the ground for far other delineations .
It has already been said , that it is stript from him in long pieces , called blanket - pieces .
Oh , man !
Do thou , too , remain warm among ice .
Like the great dome of St . Peter ' s , and like the great whale , retain , O man !
For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen .
Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky , upon the fair face of the pleasant sea , wafted by the joyous breezes , that great mass of death floats on and on , till lost in infinite perspectives .
Nor is this the end .
CHAPTER 70
The Sphynx .
It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan , he was beheaded .
Remember , also , that the surgeon must operate from above , some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject , and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured , rolling , and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea .
Do you not marvel , then , at Stubb ' s boast , that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale ?
When first severed , the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped .
When this last task was accomplished it was noon , and the seamen went below to their dinner .
Thou hast been where bell or diver never went ; hast slept by many a sailor ' s side , where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down .
" Aye ?
O Nature , and O soul of man !
For , though himself and boat ' s crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle - shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod .
Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship , the Jeroboam ' s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod , as she heavily forged through the sea ( for by this time it blew very fresh ), with her main - topsail aback ; though , indeed , at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave , the boat would be pushed some way ahead ; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again .
Subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort .
A long - skirted , cabalistically - cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists .
According to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam .
He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap - door , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest - pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum .
He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan .
The consequence of all this was , that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates ; and since the epidemic had broken out , he carried a higher hand than ever ; declaring that the plague , as he called it , was at his sole command ; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure .
Such things may seem incredible ; but , however wondrous , they are true .
" Hast thou seen the White Whale ?"
With them he pushed off ; and , after much weary pulling , and many perilous , unsuccessful onsets , he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast .
But strangest of all is the circumstance , that in more instances than one , when the body has been recovered , not a single mark of violence is discernible ; the man being stark dead .
Raising a piercing shriek --" The vial !
Gabriel called off the terror - stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale .
It was sorely tumbled , damp , and covered with a dull , spotted , green mould , in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin .
" Can ' st not read it ?"
Aye , aye , it ' s but a dim scrawl ;-- what ' s this ?"
As he was studying it out , Starbuck took a long cutting - spade pole , and with his knife slightly split the end , to insert the letter there , and in that way , hand it to the boat , without its coming any closer to the ship .
" Nay , keep it thyself ," cried Gabriel to Ahab ; " thou art soon going that way ."
Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars , and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod .
Being the savage ' s bowsman , that is , the person who pulled the bow - oar in his boat ( the second one from forward ), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard - scrabble scramble upon the dead whale ' s back .
You have seen Italian organ - boys holding a dancing - ape by a long cord .
Just so , from the ship ' s steep side , did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey - rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist .
Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother ; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed .
And yet still further pondering -- while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship , which would threaten to jam him -- still further pondering , I say , I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes ; only , in most cases , he , one way or other , has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals .
Nor could I possibly forget that , do what I would , I only had the management of one end of it .
* The monkey - rope is found in all whalers ; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together .
I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship -- where he would occasionally fall , from the incessant rolling and swaying of both .
Suspended over the side in one of the stages , Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale - spades , wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach .
" Yes , this must be ginger ," peering into the as yet untasted cup .
firewood ?-- lucifer matches ?-- tinder ?-- gunpowder ?-- what the devil is ginger , I say , that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here ."
Is the steward an apothecary , sir ?
" I trust not ," said Starbuck , " it is poor stuff enough ."
Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale ; and Then Have a Talk Over Him .
For the present other matters press , and the best we can do now for the head , is to pray heaven the tackles may hold .
So close did the monster come to the hull , that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice ; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom , within three rods of the planks , he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving under the keel .
" Cut , cut !"
But I sometimes think he ' ll charm the ship to no good at last .
Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake ' s head , Stubb ?"
" Sink him !
Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship ?
" No doubt , and it ' s because of his cursed tail ; he coils it down , do ye see , in the eye of the rigging ."
' What for ?'
" But see here , Stubb , I thought you a little boasted just now , that you meant to give Fedallah a sea - toss , if you got a good chance .
" But he ' d crawl back ."
" Mean or not mean , here we are at the ship ."
said Flask ; " yes , you ' ll soon see this right whale ' s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti ' s ."
CHAPTER 74
To the Nantucketer , they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale .
As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads ; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod ' s side ; and as we may freely go from one to the other , by merely stepping across the deck :-- where , I should like to know , will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here ?
In a word , the position of the whale ' s eyes corresponds to that of a man ' s ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways survey objects through your ears .
In a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two fronts ( side fronts ): for what is it that makes the front of a man -- what , indeed , but his eyes ?
Moreover , while in most other animals that I can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale ' s eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts .
The whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him .
A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan .
Nor , strictly investigated , is there any incongruity in this comparison .
It may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them .
It is lodged a little behind the eye .
from floor to ceiling , lined , or rather papered with a glistening white membrane , glossy as bridal satins .
If you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific portcullis ; and such , alas !
There are generally forty - two teeth in all ; in old whales , much worn down , but undecayed ; nor filled after our artificial fashion .
CHAPTER 75
At any rate , when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet , such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you ; unless , indeed , your fancy has been fixed by the technical term " crown " also bestowed upon it ; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea , whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner .
But if this whale be a king , he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem .
Over this lip , as over a slippery threshold , we now slide into the mouth .
Upon my word were I at Mackinaw , I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam .
Good Lord !
As every one knows , these same " hogs ' bristles ," " fins ," " whiskers ," " blinds ," or whatever you please , furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances .
It is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck .
But mark the other head ' s expression .
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature .
I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl - coloured membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale ' s case .
It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since -- as has been elsewhere set forth -- the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty - six feet for the depth of the tun , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship ' s side .
It is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter .
He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single - sheaved block .
There -- still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries -- he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower .
Whether it was that Tashtego , that wild Indian , was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one - handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy ; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so , without stating his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up -- my God !
poor Tashtego -- like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well , dropped head - foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily gurgling , went clean out of sight !
and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand - hold on the whip itself , the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom .
yelled the seamen to Daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out .
" Stand clear of the tackle !"
cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket .
both !-- it is both !"
He averred , that upon first thrusting in for him , a leg was presented ; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be , and might occasion great trouble ;-- he had thrust back the leg , and by a dexterous heave and toss , had wrought a somerset upon the Indian ; so that with the next trial , he came forth in the good old way -- head foremost .
I know that this queer adventure of the Gay - Header ' s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen , though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one ' s falling into a cistern ashore ; an accident which not seldom happens , and with much less reason too than the Indian ' s , considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale ' s well .
To scan the lines of his face , or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan ; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken .
Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar , or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon .
Therefore , though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer , in the application of these two semi - sciences to the whale , I will do my endeavor .
He has no proper nose .
Nevertheless , Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude , all his proportions are so stately , that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous , in him is no blemish at all .
In thought , a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning .
It signifies --" God : done this day by my hand ."
Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare ' s or Melancthon ' s rise so high , and descend so low , that the eyes themselves seem clear , eternal , tideless mountain lakes ; and all above them in the forehead ' s wrinkles , you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink , as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer .
But in life -- as we have elsewhere seen -- this inclined plane is angularly filled up , and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm .
The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life ; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks , like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec .
So like a choice casket is it secreted in him , that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic - yards of his sperm magazine .
But the curious external resemblance , I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive .
Now , I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal .
And what is still more , for many feet after emerging from the brain ' s cavity , the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth , almost equal to that of the brain .
And that the great monster is indomitable , you will yet have reason to know .
" What has he in his hand there ?"
Nevertheless , he stuck to their wake , though indeed their back water must have retarded him , because the white - bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one , like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet .
It ' s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern ; but look , did ever whale yaw so before ?
it must be , he ' s lost his tiller ."
" Mind he don ' t sling thee with it ," cried Starbuck .
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish , because not only was he the largest , and therefore the most valuable whale , but he was nearest to them , and the other whales were going with such great velocity , moreover , as almost to defy pursuit for the time .
The only thing they feared , was , that from being already so nigh to his mark , he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him .
my lads , DO spring -- slap - jacks and quahogs for supper , you know , my lads -- baked clams and muffins -- oh , DO , DO , spring ,-- he ' s a hundred barreller -- don ' t lose him now -- don ' t oh , DON ' T !-- see that Yarman -- Oh , won ' t ye pull for your duff , my lads -- such a sog !
cried Stubb .
Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod ' s boats the advantage , and rather than be thus foiled of his game , Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart , ere the last chance would for ever escape .
Blinding vapours of foam and white - fire !
this is the way to sail now .
One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line - of - battle ships , with all their guns , and stores , and men on board .
Suspended ?
In that sloping afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes ' army .
His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion .
His eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld .
Still rolling in his blood , at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance , the size of a bushel , low down on the flank .
It was most piteous , that last expiring spout .
As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain , and with half - stifled melancholy gurglings the spray - column lowers and lowers to the ground -- so the last long dying spout of the whale .
Where one of that sort go down , twenty Right Whales do .
A line - of - battle ship could hardly keep him under then .
Nevertheless , the Fin - Back ' s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale ' s , that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it .
CHAPTER 82
The more I dive into this matter of whaling , and push my researches up to the very spring - head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity ; and especially when I find so many great demi - gods and heroes , prophets of all sorts , who one way or other have shed distinction upon it , I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong , though but subordinately , to so emblazoned a fraternity .
It was an admirable artistic exploit , rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day ; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart .
When the Romans took Joppa , the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph .
What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story , is this : it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail .
" Thou art as a lion of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea ," saith Ezekiel ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some versions of the Bible use that word itself .
In fact , placed before the strict and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the Philistines , Dagon by name ; who being planted before the ark of Israel , his horse ' s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained .
Thus , then , one of our own noble stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of England ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St . George .
And therefore , let not the knights of that honourable company ( none of whom , I venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron ), let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St . George ' s decoration than they .
It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside .
there ' s a member - roll for you !
What club but the whaleman ' s can head off like that ?
One old Sag - Harbor whaleman ' s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this :-- He had one of those quaint old - fashioned Bibles , embellished with curious , unscientific plates ; one of which represented Jonah ' s whale with two spouts in his head -- a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan ( the Right Whale , and the varieties of that order ), concerning which the fishermen have this saying , " A penny roll would choke him "; his swallow is so very small .
It is not necessary , hints the Bishop , that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale ' s belly , but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth .
Possibly , too , Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth ; but , on second thoughts , the Right Whale is toothless .
How is that ?
Besides , this idea of Jonah ' s weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz , its reputed discoverer , and so make modern history a liar .
I say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and abominable , devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy .
And so it was .
And some three centuries ago , an English traveller in old Harris ' s Voyages , speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah , in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil .
What then remained ?
Small sword , or broad sword , in all its exercises boasts nothing like it .
He minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his chin .
Yea , verily , hearts alive , we ' d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout - hole there , and from that live punch - bowl quaff the living stuff ."
That for six thousand years -- and no one knows how many millions of ages before -- the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep , as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these sprinklings and spoutings -- that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute ( fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o ' clock P . M . of this sixteenth day of December , A . D . 1851 ), it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapour -- this is surely a noteworthy thing .
No , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head .
The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable ; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true , seems the more cogent to me , when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT , as the fishermen phrase it .
Remark , however , that in different individuals these rates are different ; but in any one they are alike .
It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout - hole ; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him ; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout - hole ; and being so clogged with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of smelling .
It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal ; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle .
You have seen him spout ; then declare what the spout is ; can you not tell water from air ?
It will not do for him to be peering into it , and putting his face in it .
Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony , but it often bestows it ; and in everything imposingly beautiful , strength has much to do with the magic .
When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form , mark what robustness is there .
Scroll - wise coiled forwards beneath the body , and then rapidly sprung backwards , it is this which gives that singular darting , leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming .
The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air ; then smiting the surface , the thunderous concussion resounds for miles .
Fifth : As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back , they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface ; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps , his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air , and so remain vibrating a moment , till they downwards shoot out of view .
But in gazing at such scenes , it is all in all what mood you are in ; if in the Dantean , the devils will occur to you ; if in that of Isaiah , the archangels .
Surely , he will stop for water .
So Ahab .
Now , as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java , in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda ; indeed , as most of the ground , roundabout , was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising ; therefore , as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head , the look - outs were repeatedly hailed , and admonished to keep wide awake .
But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow , and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air , yet not a single jet was descried .
It seemed formed of detached white vapours , rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales ; only they did not so completely come and go ; for they constantly hovered , without finally disappearing .
But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side , emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays .
" Out of the way , Commodore !"
cried one , to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to swamp us .
All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the Nantucket Indians , called druggs .
It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged - harpoons , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale ' s way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful disorders seemed waning .
In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin - like surface , called a sleek , produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods .
The delicate side - fins , and the palms of his flukes , still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby ' s ears newly arrived from foreign parts .
cried Queequeg , looking over the gunwale ; " him fast !
Who struck ?-- Two whale ; one big , one little !"
As when the stricken whale , that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope ; as , after deep sounding , he floats up again , and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air ; so now , Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan , by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam .
Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase , this natural line , with the maternal end loose , becomes entangled with the hempen one , so that the cub is thereby trapped .
*
A whale wounded ( as we afterwards learned ) in this part , but not effectually , as it seemed , had broken away from the boat , carrying along with him half of the harpoon line ; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound , he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold , at the battle of Saratoga , carrying dismay wherever he went .
he intensely whispered , seizing the helm --" gripe your oars , and clutch your souls , now !
This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg ' s hat , who , while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales , had his hat taken clean from his head by the air - eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by .
The waif is a pennoned pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near .
The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking ; because , while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions , the ladies , even at full growth , are not more than one - third of the bulk of an average - sized male .
Nevertheless , it cannot be denied , that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to EMBONPOINT .
Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile , still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario , like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines .
It is therefore not in strict character , however admirably satirical , that after going to school himself , he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there , but the folly of it .
Say you strike a Forty - barrel - bull -- poor devil !
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law , yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter .
II .
Mr . Erskine was counsel for the defendants ; Lord Ellenborough was the judge .
case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to bridle his wife ' s viciousness , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , repenting of that step , he instituted an action to recover possession of her .
Erskine was on the other side ; and he then supported it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness , had at last abandoned her ; yet abandon her he did , so that she became a loose - fish ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re - harpooned her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman ' s property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her .
But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted , and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case ; these two laws touching Fast - Fish and Loose - Fish , I say , will , on reflection , be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence ; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture , the Temple of the Law , like the Temple of the Philistines , has but two props to stand on .
Is it not a saying in every one ' s mouth , Possession is half of the law : that is , regardless of how the thing came into possession ?
What to the rapacious landlord is the widow ' s last mite but a Fast - Fish ?
What are the Duke of Dunder ' s hereditary towns and hamlets but Fast - Fish ?
What at last will Mexico be to the United States ?
Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle , called a Lord Warden .
Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them .
I seize it as the Lord Warden ' s ."
At length one of them , after long scratching about for his ideas , made bold to speak ,
" I thought to relieve my old bed - ridden mother by part of my share of this whale ."
Is this the still militant old man , standing at the corners of the three kingdoms , on all hands coercing alms of beggars ?
An allegorical meaning may lurk here .
" I will bet something now ," said Stubb , " that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day .
Presently , the vapours in advance slid aside ; and there in the distance lay a ship , whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside .
The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade - pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales .
And as for the other whale , why , I ' ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours , than he ' ll get from that bundle of bones ; though , now that I think of it , it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil ; yes , ambergris .
Issuing from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat ' s crew , and pulled off for the stranger .
" Well , then , my Bouton - de - Rose - bud , have you seen the White Whale ?"
" The WHITE Whale -- a Sperm Whale -- Moby Dick , have ye seen him ?
" Very good , then ; good bye now , and I ' ll call again in a minute ."
He now perceived that the Guernsey - man , who had just got into the chains , and was using a cutting - spade , had slung his nose in a sort of bag .
" Broke it ?"
answered the Guernsey - man , who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much .
keep cool -- cool ?
yes , that ' s the word !
why don ' t you pack those whales in ice while you ' re working at ' em ?
" I know that well enough ; but , d ' ye see , the Captain here won ' t believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a Cologne manufacturer before .
But come aboard , and mayhap he ' ll believe you , if he won ' t me ; and so I ' ll get out of this dirty scrape ."
Now and then pairs of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast - head to get some fresh air .
Marking all this , Stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the Guernsey - man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle .
By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin .
To this gentleman , Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey - man , who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them .
" He wants you to take a glass of wine with him ," said the interpreter .
" Thank him heartily ; but tell him it ' s against my principles to drink with the man I ' ve diddled .
In fact , tell him I must go ."
Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning .
" I have it , I have it ," cried Stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean regions , " a purse !
For at that time , and indeed until a comparatively late day , the precise origin of ambergris remained , like amber itself , a problem to the learned .
The consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and unloading one of these whale cemeteries , in the Greenland dock , a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave - yard , for the foundations of a Lying - in - Hospital .
In outer aspect , Pip and Dough - Boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar colour , driven in one eccentric span .
But while hapless Dough - Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects , Pip , though over tender - hearted , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer , freer relish than any other race .
But Pip loved life , and all life ' s peaceable securities ; so that the panic - striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped , had most sadly blurred his brightness ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily subdued in him , in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires , that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut , he had once enlivened many a fiddler ' s frolic on the green ; and at melodious even - tide , with his gay ha - ha !
But let us to the story .
He hated Pip for a poltroon .
All passed in a flash .
Now , in general , STICK TO THE BOAT , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT , is still better .
We can ' t afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , Pip , in Alabama .
Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money - making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence .
The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my God !
He saw God ' s foot upon the treadle of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad .
While some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try - works , of which anon .
such a sweetener !
After having my hands in it for only a few minutes , my fingers felt like eels , and began , as it were , to serpentine and spiralise .
As I sat there at my ease , cross - legged on the deck ; after the bitter exertion at the windlass ; under a blue tranquil sky ; the ship under indolent sail , and gliding so serenely along ; as I bathed my hands among those soft , gentle globules of infiltrated tissues , woven almost within the hour ; as they richly broke to my fingers , and discharged all their opulence , like fully ripe grapes their wine ; as I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma ,-- literally and truly , like the smell of spring violets ; I declare to you , that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow ; I forgot all about our horrible oath ; in that inexpressible sperm , I washed my hands and my heart of it ; I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger ; while bathing in that bath , I felt divinely free from all ill - will , or petulance , or malice , of any sort whatsoever .
I hold it to be the wondrously thin , ruptured membranes of the case , coalescing .
But as applied by whalemen , it becomes so .
On one side , lit by a dull lantern , a space has been left clear for the workmen .
Ere long , it is taken down ; when removing some three feet of it , towards the pointed extremity , and then cutting two slits for arm - holes at the other end , he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it .
Bible leaves !
Besides her hoisted boats , an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try - works .
The try - works are planted between the foremast and mainmast , the most roomy part of the deck .
The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength , fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar , some ten feet by eight square , and five in height .
Removing the fire - board from the front of the try - works , the bare masonry of that side is exposed , penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces , directly underneath the pots .
This was an easy thing , for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage .
These fritters feed the flames .
We were clear from the carcase ; sail had been made ; the wind was freshening ; the wild ocean darkness was intense .
So the pitch and sulphur - freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote , Canaris , issuing from their midnight harbors , with broad sheets of flame for sails , bore down upon the Turkish frigates , and folded them in conflagrations .
With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots , or stirred up the fires beneath , till the snaky flames darted , curling , out of the doors to catch them by the feet .
But that night , in particular , a strange ( and ever since inexplicable ) thing occurred to me .
My God !
in my brief sleep I had turned myself about , and was fronting the ship ' s stern , with my back to her prow and the compass .
How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night , and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee !
Never dream with thy hand on the helm !
So , therefore , that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him , that mortal man cannot be true -- not true , or undeveloped .
" All is vanity ."
ALL .
At length , when the last pint is casked , and all is cool , then the great hatchways are unsealed , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea .
The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue .
Hands go diligently along the bulwarks , and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness .
All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away .
and away they fly to fight another whale , and go through the whole weary thing again .
When he halted before the binnacle , with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass , that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose ; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast , then , as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there , he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness , only dashed with a certain wild longing , if not hopefulness .
Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic token - pieces .
It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things .
Born in throes , ' t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs !
So be it , then !
So be it , then ."
Humph !
Let ' s see now .
Aye , here on the coin he ' s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting - rooms all in a ring .
Look you , Doubloon , your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now I ' ll read it off , straight out of the book .
As we pluck out the shafts , stand aside !
But stop ; here comes little King - Post ; dodge round the try - works , now , and let ' s hear what he ' ll have to say .
There ; he ' s before it ; he ' ll out with something presently .
So , so ; he ' s beginning ."
" Shall I call that wise or foolish , now ; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it ; yet , if it be really foolish , then has it a sort of wiseish look to it .
I ' ve studied signs , and know their marks ; they were taught me two score years ago , by the old witch in Copenhagen .
my old head shakes to think of thee ."
Dodge again !
What says the Cannibal ?
Ho !
Improving his mind , poor fellow !
But what ' s that he says now -- hist !"
" Why , he ' s getting it by heart -- hist !
" I look , you look , he looks ; we look , ye look , they look ."
caw !
caw !
And where ' s the scare - crow ?
So , so , I leave him muttering ."
" Here ' s the ship ' s navel , this doubloon here , and they are all on fire to unscrew it .
But , unscrew your navel , and what ' s the consequence ?
Ha , ha !
Cook !
Leg and Arm .
Hast seen the White Whale ?"
Jump , boys , and swing over the cutting - tackle ."
" Stood our old Sammy off to the northward , to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line .
" Oh , very severe !"
But I may as well say -- en passant , as the French remark -- that I myself -- that is to say , Jack Bunger , late of the reverend clergy -- am a strict total abstinence man ; I never drink --"
In short , it grew black ; I knew what was threatened , and off it came .
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule "-- pointing at it with the marlingspike --" that is the captain ' s work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that club - hammer there put to the end , to knock some one ' s brains out with , I suppose , as he tried mine once .
" No , I don ' t ," said the captain , " but his mother did ; he was born with it .
" What became of the White Whale ?"
Well ; after he sounded , we didn ' t see him again for some time ; in fact , as I before hinted , I didn ' t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick , till some time afterwards , when coming back to the Line , we heard about Moby Dick -- as some call him -- and then I knew it was he ."
No more White Whales for me ; I ' ve lowered for him once , and that has satisfied me .
" Avast !"
But Fedallah , putting a finger on his lip , slid over the bulwarks to take the boat ' s steering oar , and Ahab , swinging the cutting - tackle towards him , commanded the ship ' s sailors to stand by to lower .
Be it distinctly recorded here , that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him .
That ship -- well called the " Syren "-- made a noble experimental cruise ; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known .
If you stooped over too far forward , you risked their pitching out of you like billiard - balls .
For , as a general thing , the English merchant - ship scrimps her crew ; but not so the English whaler .
Friesland pork .
Now , as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate , so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail , we have 5 , 400 Low Dutch seamen in all ; therefore , I say , we have precisely two barrels of beer per man , for a twelve weeks ' allowance , exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin .
Hitherto , in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale , I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect ; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features .
But how now , Ishmael ?
For being at Tranque , years ago , when attached to the trading - ship Dey of Algiers , I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque , at his retired palm villa at Pupella ; a sea - side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo - Town , his capital .
Oh , busy weaver !
From their arrow - slit in the skull , the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib , " How now !"
they shouted ; " Dar ' st thou measure this our god !
There is a Leviathanic Museum , they tell me , in Hull , England , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin - backs and other whales .
Moreover , at a place in Yorkshire , England , Burton Constable by name , a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale , but of moderate size , by no means of the full - grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo ' s .
The first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each successively longer , till you came to the climax of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches .
In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams .
Besides , for some way , where I now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , muscle , blood , and bowels .
No speedy enterprise .
But now it ' s done , it looks much like Pompey ' s Pillar .
There are forty and odd vertebrae in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together .
CHAPTER 104
From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge , amplify , and generally expatiate .
But when Leviathan is the text , the case is altered .
No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea , though many there be who have tried it .
Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales , I present my credentials as a geologist , by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone - mason , and also a great digger of ditches , canals and wells , wine - vaults , cellars , and cisterns of all sorts .
Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species .
But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen , the English Anatomist , it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale , though of a departed species .
The Common People imagine , that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple , no Whale can pass it without immediate death .
Whereas , we have already seen , that the tape - measure gives seventy - two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale .
And even in the days of Banks and Solander , Cooke ' s naturalists , we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales ( reydan - siskur , or Wrinkled Bellies ) at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet .
No .
But still another inquiry remains ; one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers .
For they are only being driven from promontory to cape ; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets , then , be sure , some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle .
But though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than 13 , 000 , have been annually slain on the nor '- west coast by the Americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter .
The ineffaceable , sad birth - mark in the brow of man , is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers .
With many other particulars concerning Ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some , why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the sailing of the Pequod , he had hidden himself away with such Grand - Lama - like exclusiveness ; and , for that one interval , sought speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble senate of the dead .
This done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the fittings for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use .
But , besides the application to him of the generic remark above , this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship , upon a three or four years ' voyage , in uncivilized and far - distant seas .
Teeth he accounted bits of ivory ; heads he deemed but top - blocks ; men themselves he lightly held for capstans .
He was a stript abstract ; an unfractioned integral ; uncompromised as a new - born babe ; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next .
He was a pure manipulator ; his brain , if he had ever had one , must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers .
He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful , MULTUM IN PARVO , Sheffield contrivances , assuming the exterior -- though a little swelled -- of a common pocket knife ; but containing , not only blades of various sizes , but also screw - drivers , cork - screws , tweezers , awls , pens , rulers , nail - filers , countersinkers .
That is hard which should be soft , and that is soft which should be hard .
Lucky now ( SNEEZES ) there ' s no knee - joint to make ; that might puzzle a little ; but a mere shinbone -- why it ' s easy as making hop - poles ; only I should like to put a good finish on .
Just in time , sir .
Let me measure , sir .
There ; keep thy finger on it .
No fear ; I like a good grip ; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold , man .
Right .
Um - m .
There , take the order , and away .
Shall I keep standing here ?
No , no , no ; I must have a lantern .
Sir ?-- Clay ?
What art thou sneezing about ?
Yes , I have heard something curious on that score , sir ; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar , but it will be still pricking him at times .
Look , put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was ; so , now , here is only one distinct leg to the eye , yet two to the soul .
Is ' t a riddle ?
How dost thou know that some entire , living , thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest ; aye , and standing there in thy spite ?
By heavens !
CARPENTER ( RESUMING HIS WORK ).
I don ' t wonder he looked so scornful at me !
Look , driven one leg to death , and spavined the other for life , and now wears out bone legs by the cord .
Halloa !
I almost forgot the little oval slate , smoothed ivory , where he figures up the latitude .
Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight ; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water , the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo .
Begone !"
Now that we are nearing Japan ; heave - to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops ?"
Yet I don ' t stop to plug my leak ; for who can find it in the deep - loaded hull ; or how hope to plug it , even if found , in this life ' s howling gale ?
I ' ll not have the Burtons hoisted ."
" Captain Ahab ," said the reddening mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; " A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man ; aye , and in a happier , Captain Ahab ."
Poor Queequeg !
An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage , and saw as strange things in his face , as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died .
No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order , than taking his rule , he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character , proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg ' s measure with great accuracy , regularly chalking Queequeg ' s person as he shifted the rule .
All by his own request , also , biscuits were then ranged round the sides within : a flask of fresh water was placed at the head , and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot ; and a piece of sail - cloth being rolled up for a pillow , Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed , that he might make trial of its comforts , if any it had .
Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between , he called for the coffin lid ( hatch he called it ) to be placed over him .
Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow !
Tell them he jumped from a whale - boat !
No , no !
Pip was led away , and the sick man was replaced in his hammock .
His firm lips met like the lips of a vice ; the Delta of his forehead ' s veins swelled like overladen brooks ; in his very sleep , his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull , " Stern all !
And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in ; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate .
He was an old man , who , at the age of nearly sixty , had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow ' s technicals called ruin .
He had been an artisan of famed excellence , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a youthful , daughter - like , loving wife , and three blithe , ruddy children ; every Sunday went to a cheerful - looking church , planted in a grove .
But one night , under cover of darkness , and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement , a desperate burglar slid into his happy home , and robbed them all of everything .
Oh , Death , why canst thou not sometimes be timely ?
Why tell the whole ?
Come hither !
Hearkening to these voices , East and West , by early sunrise , and by fall of eve , the blacksmith ' s soul responded , Aye , I come !
Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly , sanely woeful to me .
How can ' st thou endure without being mad ?
Do the heavens yet hate thee , that thou can ' st not go mad ?-- What wert thou making there ?"
Can ' st thou smoothe this seam ?"
And forge me first , twelve rods for its shank ; then wind , and twist , and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow - line .
" What ' s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for ?"
" Would ' st thou brand me , Perth ?"
A cluster of dark nods replied , Yes .
This done , pole , iron , and rope -- like the Three Fates -- remained inseparable , and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the hickory pole , both hollowly ringing along every plank .
CHAPTER 114
Nor did such soothing scenes , however temporary , fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab .
Oh , grassy glades !
But once gone through , we trace the round again ; and are infants , boys , and men , and Ifs eternally .
The Pequod Meets The Bachelor .
The three men at her mast - head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats ; from the stern , a whale - boat was suspended , bottom down ; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain .
As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod , the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle ; and drawing still nearer , a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try - pots , which , covered with the parchment - like POKE or stomach skin of the black fish , gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew .
Sail on .
" Not enough to speak of -- two islanders , that ' s all ;-- but come aboard , old hearty , come along .
muttered Ahab ; then aloud , " Thou art a full ship and homeward bound , thou sayst ; well , then , call me an empty ship , and outward - bound .
So go thy ways , and I will mine .
Look !
" Oh , trebly hooped and welded hip of power !
Ahab and all his boat ' s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee ; who crouching in the bow , sat watching the sharks , that spectrally played round the whale , and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails .
" Of the hearses ?
" But I said , old man , that ere thou couldst die on this voyage , two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea ; the first not made by mortal hands ; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America ."
Ha !
Such a sight we shall not soon see ."
" And what was that saying about thyself ?"
Well , then , did I believe all ye say , oh my pilot !
The sky looks lacquered ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God ' s throne .
Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living ?
These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him ; aye , and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown , thither side of thee , thou sun !"
not one jot more !
Curse thee , thou vain toy ; and cursed be all the things that cast man ' s eyes aloft to that heaven , whose live vividness but scorches him , as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light , O sun !
Level by nature to this earth ' s horizon are the glances of man ' s eyes ; not shot from the crown of his head , as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament .
In an instant the yards swung round ; and as the ship half - wheeled upon her heel , her three firm - seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long , ribbed hull , seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed .
" Bad work , bad work !
But never mind ; it ' s all in fun : so the old song says ;"--( SINGS .)
" What !
cried Starbuck , seizing Stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand towards the weather bow , " markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward , the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick ?
the very course he swung to this day noon ?
In the stern - sheets , man ; where he is wont to stand -- his stand - point is stove , man !
" I don ' t half understand ye : what ' s in the wind ?"
" Are they overboard ?
" Blast the boat !
The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft ; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall .
and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor .
Take the homage of these poor eyes , and shutter - hands .
Oh , oh !
There lies my puzzle ; but thine is greater .
the boat !"
" Sir !-- in God ' s name !-- sir ?"
" Strike nothing , and stir nothing , but lash everything .
The wind rises , but it has not got up to my table - lands yet .
What a hooroosh aloft there !
Stop , now ; didn ' t you say so ?"
I ' ve part changed my flesh since that time , why not my mind ?
First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here , though , so I can pass the rope ; now listen .
it ' s easy to be sensible ; why don ' t ye , then ?
" I don ' t know that , Stubb .
You sometimes find it rather hard ."
Tying these two anchors here , Flask , seems like tying a man ' s hands behind him .
I wonder , Flask , whether the world is anchored anywhere ; if she is , she swings with an uncommon long cable , though .
Plenty too much thunder up here .
Um , um , um .
CHAPTER 123
During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon , the man at the Pequod ' s jaw - bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions , even though preventer tackles had been attached to it -- for they were slack -- because some play to the tiller was indispensable .
In a severe gale like this , while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast , it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses , at intervals , go round and round .
It was thus with the Pequod ' s ; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards ; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion .
Some hours after midnight , the Typhoon abated so much , that through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb -- one engaged forward and the other aft -- the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main - top - sails were cut adrift from the spars , and went eddying away to leeward , like the feathers of an albatross , which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm - tossed bird is on the wing .
For during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes .
But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible , watching the compass meanwhile , lo !
Ere knocking at his state - room , he involuntarily paused before it a moment .
The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed , as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead .
Starbuck was an honest , upright man ; but out of Starbuck ' s heart , at that instant when he saw the muskets , there strangely evolved an evil thought ; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself .
Strange , that I , who have handled so many deadly lances , strange , that I should shake so now .
Best spill it ?-- wait .
I ' ll cure myself of this .
I ' ll hold the musket boldly while I think .-- I come to report a fair wind to him .
Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ?
Aye , and say ' st the men have vow ' d thy vow ; say ' st all of us are Ahabs .
What !
The land is hundreds of leagues away , and locked Japan the nearest .
boy !
Muffled in the full morning light , the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place ; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks .
" East - sou - east , sir ," said the frightened steersman .
" Thou liest !"
Upon this every soul was confounded ; for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else ; but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause .
the two compasses pointed East , and the Pequod was as infallibly going West .
But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed , " I have it !
" Aye ; but never before has it happened to me , sir ," said the pale mate , gloomily .
But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet .
One after another they peered in , for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs , and one after another they slunk away .
Two seamen came .
The Manxman took the reel , and holding it high up , by the projecting handle - ends of the spindle , round which the spool of line revolved , so stood with the angular log hanging downwards , till Ahab advanced to him .
Or , truer perhaps , life holds thee ; not thou it ."
But just as my captain says .
Where wert thou born ?"
Thou ' st hit the world by that ."
" I know not , sir , but I was born there ."
But Ahab can mend all .
And look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and mend thou the line .
Haul in , haul in , Tahitian !
These lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and dragging slow .
Ha , Pip ?
Pip jumped from the whale - boat .
Captain Ahab !
Lo !
Oh God !
" Bell - boy , sir ; ship ' s - crier ; ding , dong , ding !
" Ah , now , had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this , perhaps he had ne ' er been lost !
Come !
I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand , than though I grasped an Emperor ' s !"
Mend it , eh ?
The Life - Buoy .
He hollowly laughed , and thus explained the wonder .
Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals , and some young seals that had lost their dams , or some dams that had lost their cubs , must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her , crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail .
But few , perhaps , thought of that at the time .
Indeed , in some sort , they were not grieved at this event , at least as a portent ; for they regarded it , not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future , but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged .
But again the old Manxman said nay .
" It will make a good enough one ," said Flask , " the carpenter here can arrange it easily ."
" Aye ."
Stubb , Mr . Flask , come forward with me ."
It ' s the old woman ' s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs .
there are no caps at sea but snow - caps .
Were ever such things done before with a coffin ?
Any way , I ' ll have me thirty separate , Turk ' s - headed life - lines , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin .
What ' s here ?"
Mr . Starbuck ' s orders .
" Well enough .
" Then tell me ; art thou not an arrant , all - grasping , intermeddling , monopolising , heathenish old scamp , to be one day making legs , and the next day coffins to clap them in , and yet again life - buoys out of those same coffins ?
I do as I do ."
" The gods again .
" Aye , and that ' s because the lid there ' s a sounding - board ; and what in all things makes the sounding - board is this -- there ' s naught beneath .
" Faith ?
What ' s that ?"
" Um , um ; go on ."
" He goes aft .
He ' s always under the Line -- fiery hot , I tell ye !
This wooden mallet is the cork , and I ' m the professor of musical glasses -- tap , tap !"
Blind and dumb might well be envied now .
Oh !
In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat ; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water ; and after that nothing more ; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers , as often happens .
He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were .
" I will wager something now ," whispered Stubb to Flask , " that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captain ' s best coat ; mayhap , his watch -- he ' s so cursed anxious to get it back .
" He ' s drowned with the rest on ' em , last night ," said the old Manx sailor standing behind them ; " I heard ; all of ye heard their spirits ."
Hurriedly turning , with averted face , he descended into his cabin , leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit .
CHAPTER 129
The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him , yet would not have thee by him .
and crazy !-- but methinks like - cures - like applies to him too ; he grows so sane again ."
" They tell me , sir , that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip , whose drowned bones now show white , for all the blackness of his living skin .
" Oh good master , master , master !
And now I quit thee .
( AHAB GOES ; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD .)
Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it , but he ' s missing .
He must be up here ; let ' s try the door .
Ha !
epaulets !
Put one foot upon the table .
Shame upon all cowards .-- Hist !
above there , I hear ivory -- Oh , master !
master !
The Hat .
As the unsetting polar star , which through the livelong , arctic , six months ' night sustains its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so Ahab ' s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew .
-- and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman ' s bell , was heard --" What d ' ye see ?-- sharp !
But when three or four days had slided by , after meeting the children - seeking Rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew ' s fidelity ; at least , of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought .
" I will have the first sight of the whale myself ,"-- he said .
Ahab must have the doubloon !
So Ahab ' s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that Starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision -- one of those too , whose faithfulness on the look - out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ;-- it was strange , that this was the very man he should select for his watchman ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person ' s hands .
suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman , who being posted at the mizen - mast - head , stood directly behind Ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them .
An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin ' s head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon Tanaquil , his wife , declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome .
CHAPTER 131
As she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called shears , which , in some whaling - ships , cross the quarter - deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; serving to carry the spare , unrigged , or disabled boats .
" Hast killed him ?"
God "-- advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands --" may the resurrection and the life --"
The Symphony .
Tied up and twisted ; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles ; haggardly firm and unyielding ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still glow in the ashes of ruin ; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn ; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl ' s forehead of heaven .
From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop .
forty years of privation , and peril , and storm - time !
let us away !-- this instant let me alter the course !
the boy ' s hand on the hill !"
Is it I , God , or who , that lifts this arm ?
And all the time , lo !
who put it into him to chase and fang that flying - fish ?
Where do murderers go , man !
Who ' s to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ?
Sleeping ?
Aye , toil we how we may , we all sleep at last on the field .
That night , in the mid - watch , when the old man -- as his wont at intervals -- stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went to his pivot - hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship ' s dog will , in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle .
" There she blows !-- there she blows !
It is Moby Dick !"
So ; steady , man , steady !
Stand by , stand by !
and he slid through the air to the deck .
Stand by the braces !
As they neared him , the ocean grew still more smooth ; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves ; seemed a noon - meadow , so serenely it spread .
He saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond .
But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea , alternate with their fitful flight ; and like to some flag - staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy , the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale ' s back ; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft - toed fowls hovering , and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail feathers streaming like pennons .
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns ; his lovely , leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid ; with smooth bewitching fleetness , rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete ; not Jove , not that great majesty Supreme !
Yet calm , enticing calm , oh , whale !
" An hour ," said Ahab , standing rooted in his boat ' s stern ; and he gazed beyond the whale ' s place , towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward .
" The birds !-- the birds !"
But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths , he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel , with wonderful celerity uprising , and magnifying as it rose , till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the undiscoverable bottom .
But as if perceiving this stratagem , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat .
But only slipping further into the whale ' s mouth , and tilting over sideways as it slipped , the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell flat - faced upon the sea .
* So , in a gale , the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone , triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud .
For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale ' s aspect , and so planetarily swift the ever - contracting circles he made , that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them .
Meantime , from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship ' s mast heads ; and squaring her yards , she had borne down upon the scene ; and was now so nigh , that Ahab in the water hailed her !--" Sail on the "-- but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick , and whelmed him for the time .
" That ' s good .-- Help me , man ; I wish to stand .
D ' ye see him ?"
In this way the day wore on ; Ahab , now aloft and motionless ; anon , unrestingly pacing the planks .
ha !"
Sing out for every spout , though he spout ten times a second !"
" How heading when last seen ?"
We must not run over him before morning ; he ' s making a passage now , and may heave - to a while .
cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread .
But no matter --' tis but resting for the rush ."
Here be it said , that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale , continued through day into night , and through night into day , is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery .
And , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general trending he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen headland , eventually to be visited : so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night obscures the fish , the creature ' s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot ' s coast is to him .
This ship and I are two brave fellows !-- Ha , ha !
Some one take me up , and launch me , spine - wise , on the sea ,-- for by live - oaks !
we go the gait that leaves no dust behind !"
cried Stubb , " I knew it -- ye can ' t escape -- blow on and split your spout , O whale !
blow your trump -- blister your lungs !-- Ahab will dam off your blood , as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream !"
And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew .
The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the stirring perils of the previous day ; the rack of the past night ' s suspense ; the fixed , unfearing , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were bowled along .
They were one man , not thirty .
The rigging lived .
Ah !
As before , the attentive ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks .
call them all ."
cried Stubb --" he must have been caught in --"
What means that little word ?-- What death - knell rings in it , that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry .
I ' ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but I ' ll slay him yet !
I am the Fates ' lieutenant ; I act under orders .
But ere I break , yell hear me crack ; and till ye hear THAT , know that Ahab ' s hawser tows his purpose yet .
Then laugh aloud , and cry encore !
I ' LL , I ' LL solve it , though !"
God only has that right and privilege .
Run tilting at it , and you but run through it .
To it !
I ' ve oversailed him .
How , got the start ?
Aye , he ' s chasing ME now ; not I , HIM -- that ' s bad ; I might have known it , too .
" God keep us , but already my bones feel damp within me , and from the inside wet my flesh .
There ' s a soft shower to leeward .
I can ' t compare with it ; and I ' ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers .
Good - bye , mast - head -- keep a good eye upon the whale , the while I ' m gone .
We ' ll talk to - morrow , nay , to - night , when the white whale lies down there , tied by head and tail ."
" Starbuck !"
-- cried Ahab , tossing the mate ' s arm from him .
the sharks !"
cried a voice from the low cabin - window there ; " O master , my master , come back !"
Oh !
The boats had not gone very far , when by a signal from the mast - heads -- a downward pointed arm , Ahab knew that the whale had sounded ; but intending to be near him at the next rising , he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel ; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence , as the head - beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow .
ye but strike a thing without a lid ; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine :-- and hemp only can kill me !
ha !"
Lashed round and round to the fish ' s back ; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him , the half torn body of the Parsee was seen ; his sable raiment frayed to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab .
The harpoon dropped from his hand .
-- drawing in a long lean breath --" Aye , Parsee !
I see thee again .-- Aye , and thou goest before ; and this , THIS then is the hearse that thou didst promise .
See !
' tis the better rest , the shark ' s jaw than the yielding water ."
take the helm !
let me pass ,"-- and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat .
Meantime , for that one beholding instant , Tashtego ' s mast - head hammer remained suspended in his hand ; and the red flag , half - wrapping him as with a plaid , then streamed itself straight out from him , as his own forward - flowing heart ; while Starbuck and Stubb , standing upon the bowsprit beneath , caught sight of the down - coming monster just as soon as he .
Up helm , I say -- ye fools , the jaw !
all my life - long fidelities ?
Oh , Ahab , Ahab , lo , thy work .
Nay , nay !
thou grinning whale , but there ' ll be plenty of gulping soon !
Oh , Flask , for one red cherry ere we die !"
I only wish that we were where they grow .
Through the breach , they heard the waters pour , as mountain torrents down a flume .
" I turn my body from the sun .
Oh !
from all your furthest bounds , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole foregone life , and top this one piled comber of my death !
Towards thee I roll , thou all - destroying but unconquering whale ; to the last I grapple with thee ; from hell ' s heart I stab at thee ; for hate ' s sake I spit my last breath at thee .
Soon they through dim , bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom , as in the gaseous Fata Morgana ; only the uppermost masts out of water ; while fixed by infatuation , or fidelity , or fate , to their once lofty perches , the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea .
A sky - hawk that tauntingly had followed the main - truck downwards from its natural home among the stars , pecking at the flag , and incommoding Tashtego there ; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill , the submerged savage beneath , in his death - gasp , kept his hammer frozen there ; and so the bird of heaven , with archangelic shrieks , and his imperial beak thrust upwards , and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab , went down with his ship , which , like Satan , would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and helmeted herself with it .
It so chanced , that after the Parsee ' s disappearance , I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab ' s bowsman , when that bowsman assumed the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern .
So , floating on the margin of the ensuing scene , and in full sight of it , when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me , I was then , but slowly , drawn towards the closing vortex .
It was the devious - cruising Rachel , that in her retracing search after her missing children , only found another orphan .
Th ' infernal Serpent ; he it was whose guile , Stirred up with envy and revenge , deceived The mother of mankind , what time his pride Had cast him out from Heaven , with all his host Of rebel Angels , by whose aid , aspiring To set himself in glory above his peers , He trusted to have equalled the Most High , If he opposed , and with ambitious aim Against the throne and monarchy of God , Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud , With vain attempt .
Nine times the space that measures day and night To mortal men , he , with his horrid crew , Lay vanquished , rolling in the fiery gulf , Confounded , though immortal .
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared For those rebellious ; here their prison ordained In utter darkness , and their portion set , As far removed from God and light of Heaven As from the centre thrice to th ' utmost pole .
There the companions of his fall , o ' erwhelmed With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire , He soon discerns ; and , weltering by his side , One next himself in power , and next in crime , Long after known in Palestine , and named Beelzebub .
Hail , horrors !
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends , Th ' associates and co - partners of our loss , Lie thus astonished on th ' oblivious pool , And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy mansion , or once more With rallied arms to try what may be yet Regained in Heaven , or what more lost in Hell ?"
He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend Was moving toward the shore ; his ponderous shield , Ethereal temper , massy , large , and round , Behind him cast .
Or have ye chosen this place After the toil of battle to repose Your wearied virtue , for the ease you find To slumber here , as in the vales of Heaven ?
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight In which they were , or the fierce pains not feel ; Yet to their General ' s voice they soon obeyed Innumerable .
As when the potent rod Of Amram ' s son , in Egypt ' s evil day , Waved round the coast , up - called a pitchy cloud Of locusts , warping on the eastern wind , That o ' er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung Like Night , and darkened all the land of Nile ; So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell , ' Twixt upper , nether , and surrounding fires ; Till , as a signal given , th ' uplifted spear Of their great Sultan waving to direct Their course , in even balance down they light On the firm brimstone , and fill all the plain : A multitude like which the populous North Poured never from her frozen loins to pass Rhene or the Danaw , when her barbarous sons Came like a deluge on the South , and spread Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands .
For Spirits , when they please , Can either sex assume , or both ; so soft And uncompounded is their essence pure , Not tried or manacled with joint or limb , Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones , Like cumbrous flesh ; but , in what shape they choose , Dilated or condensed , bright or obscure , Can execute their airy purposes , And works of love or enmity fulfil .
He also against the house of God was bold : A leper once he lost , and gained a king -- Ahaz , his sottish conqueror , whom he drew God ' s altar to disparage and displace For one of Syrian mode , whereon to burn His odious offerings , and adore the gods Whom he had vanquished .
His form had yet not lost All her original brightness , nor appeared Less than Archangel ruined , and th ' excess Of glory obscured : as when the sun new - risen Looks through the horizontal misty air Shorn of his beams , or , from behind the moon , In dim eclipse , disastrous twilight sheds On half the nations , and with fear of change Perplexes monarchs .
Thrice he assayed , and thrice , in spite of scorn , Tears , such as Angels weep , burst forth : at last Words interwove with sighs found out their way :-- " O myriads of immortal Spirits !
Meanwhile the winged Heralds , by command Of sovereign power , with awful ceremony And trumpet ' s sound , throughout the host proclaim A solemn council forthwith to be held At Pandemonium , the high capital Of Satan and his peers .
All access was thronged ; the gates And porches wide , but chief the spacious hall ( Though like a covered field , where champions bold Wont ride in armed , and at the Soldan ' s chair Defied the best of Paynim chivalry To mortal combat , or career with lance ), Thick swarmed , both on the ground and in the air , Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings .
High on a throne of royal state , which far Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind , Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold , Satan exalted sat , by merit raised To that bad eminence ; and , from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope , aspires Beyond thus high , insatiate to pursue Vain war with Heaven ; and , by success untaught , His proud imaginations thus displayed :-- " Powers and Dominions , Deities of Heaven !-- For , since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigour , though oppressed and fallen , I give not Heaven for lost : from this descent Celestial Virtues rising will appear More glorious and more dread than from no fall , And trust themselves to fear no second fate !-- Me though just right , and the fixed laws of Heaven , Did first create your leader -- next , free choice With what besides in council or in fight Hath been achieved of merit -- yet this loss , Thus far at least recovered , hath much more Established in a safe , unenvied throne , Yielded with full consent .
The happier state In Heaven , which follows dignity , might draw Envy from each inferior ; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Foremost to stand against the Thunderer ' s aim Your bulwark , and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain ?
With this advantage , then , To union , and firm faith , and firm accord , More than can be in Heaven , we now return To claim our just inheritance of old , Surer to prosper than prosperity Could have assured us ; and by what best way , Whether of open war or covert guile , We now debate .
Th ' ascent is easy , then ; Th ' event is feared !
what doubt we to incense His utmost ire ?
which , to the height enraged , Will either quite consume us , and reduce To nothing this essential -- happier far Than miserable to have eternal being !-- Or , if our substance be indeed divine , And cannot cease to be , we are at worst On this side nothing ; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven , And with perpetual inroads to alarm , Though inaccessible , his fatal throne : Which , if not victory , is yet revenge ."
A fairer person lost not Heaven ; he seemed For dignity composed , and high exploit .
But all was false and hollow ; though his tongue Dropped manna , and could make the worse appear The better reason , to perplex and dash Maturest counsels : for his thoughts were low -- To vice industrious , but to nobler deeds Timorous and slothful .
How he can Is doubtful ; that he never will is sure .
This Hell then seemed A refuge from those wounds .
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires , Awaked , should blow them into sevenfold rage , And plunge us in the flames ; or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us ?
This would be worse .
This was at first resolved , If we were wise , against so great a foe Contending , and so doubtful what might fall .
The former , vain to hope , argues as vain The latter ; for what place can be for us Within Heaven ' s bound , unless Heaven ' s Lord supreme We overpower ?
As he our darkness , cannot we his light Imitate when we please ?
Our torments also may , in length of time , Become our elements , these piercing fires As soft as now severe , our temper changed Into their temper ; which must needs remove The sensible of pain .
Which when Beelzebub perceived -- than whom , Satan except , none higher sat -- with grave Aspect he rose , and in his rising seemed A pillar of state .
for so the popular vote Inclines -- here to continue , and build up here A growing empire ; doubtless !
Though Heaven be shut , And Heaven ' s high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength , this place may lie exposed , The utmost border of his kingdom , left To their defence who hold it : here , perhaps , Some advantageous act may be achieved By sudden onset -- either with Hell - fire To waste his whole creation , or possess All as our own , and drive , as we were driven , The puny habitants ; or , if not drive , Seduce them to our party , that their God May prove their foe , and with repenting hand Abolish his own works .
But , first , whom shall we send In search of this new World ?
What strength , what art , can then Suffice , or what evasion bear him safe , Through the strict senteries and stations thick Of Angels watching round ?
But all sat mute , Pondering the danger with deep thoughts ; and each In other ' s countenance read his own dismay , Astonished .
Thus saying , rose The Monarch , and prevented all reply ; Prudent lest , from his resolution raised , Others among the chief might offer now , Certain to be refused , what erst they feared , And , so refused , might in opinion stand His rivals , winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn .
Then of their session ended they bid cry With trumpet ' s regal sound the great result : Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy , By herald ' s voice explained ; the hollow Abyss Heard far adn wide , and all the host of Hell With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim .
Part on the plain , or in the air sublime , Upon the wing or in swift race contend , As at th ' Olympian games or Pythian fields ; Part curb their fiery steeds , or shun the goal With rapid wheels , or fronted brigades form : As when , to warn proud cities , war appears Waged in the troubled sky , and armies rush To battle in the clouds ; before each van Prick forth the airy knights , and couch their spears , Till thickest legions close ; with feats of arms From either end of heaven the welkin burns .
Another part , in squadrons and gross bands , On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world , if any clime perhaps Might yield them easier habitation , bend Four ways their flying march , along the banks Of four infernal rivers , that disgorge Into the burning lake their baleful streams -- Abhorred Styx , the flood of deadly hate ; Sad Acheron of sorrow , black and deep ; Cocytus , named of lamentation loud Heard on the rueful stream ; fierce Phlegeton , Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage .
Thither , by harpy - footed Furies haled , At certain revolutions all the damned Are brought ; and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extremes , extremes by change more fierce , From beds of raging fire to starve in ice Their soft ethereal warmth , and there to pine Immovable , infixed , and frozen round Periods of time ,-- thence hurried back to fire .
Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man , Satan , with thoughts inflamed of highest design , Puts on swift wings , and toward the gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight : sometimes He scours the right hand coast , sometimes the left ; Now shaves with level wing the deep , then soars Up to the fiery concave towering high .
The other Shape -- If shape it might be called that shape had none Distinguishable in member , joint , or limb ; Or substance might be called that shadow seemed , For each seemed either -- black it stood as Night , Fierce as ten Furies , terrible as Hell , And shook a dreadful dart : what seemed his head The likeness of a kingly crown had on .
Through them I mean to pass , That be assured , without leave asked of thee .
So spake the grisly Terror , and in shape , So speaking and so threatening , grew tenfold , More dreadful and deform .
And know ' st for whom ?
For him who sits above , and laughs the while At thee , ordained his drudge to execute Whate ' er his wrath , which he calls justice , bids -- His wrath , which one day will destroy ye both !"
to our Almighty Foe Clear victory ; to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean .
Down they fell , Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven , down Into this Deep ; and in the general fall I also : at which time this powerful key Into my hands was given , with charge to keep These gates for ever shut , which none can pass Without my opening .
Pensive here I sat Alone ; but long I sat not , till my womb , Pregnant by thee , and now excessive grown , Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes .
She finished ; and the subtle Fiend his lore Soon learned , now milder , and thus answered smooth :-- " Dear daughter -- since thou claim ' st me for thy sire , And my fair son here show ' st me , the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven , and joys Then sweet , now sad to mention , through dire change Befallen us unforeseen , unthought - of -- know , I come no enemy , but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain Both him and thee , and all the heavenly host Of Spirits that , in our just pretences armed , Fell with us from on high .
From them I go This uncouth errand sole , and one for all Myself expose , with lonely steps to tread Th ' unfounded Deep , and through the void immense To search , with wandering quest , a place foretold Should be -- and , by concurring signs , ere now Created vast and round -- a place of bliss In the purlieus of Heaven ; and therein placed A race of upstart creatures , to supply Perhaps our vacant room , though more removed , Lest Heaven , surcharged with potent multitude , Might hap to move new broils .
Be this , or aught Than this more secret , now designed , I haste To know ; and , this once known , shall soon return , And bring ye to the place where thou and Death Shall dwell at ease , and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom air , embalmed With odours .
There ye shall be fed and filled Immeasurably ; all things shall be your prey ."
He ceased ; for both seemed highly pleased , and Death Grinned horrible a ghastly smile , to hear His famine should be filled , and blessed his maw Destined to that good hour .
Into this wild Abyss , The womb of Nature , and perhaps her grave , Of neither sea , nor shore , nor air , nor fire , But all these in their pregnant causes mixed Confusedly , and which thus must ever fight , Unless th ' Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more worlds -- Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while , Pondering his voyage ; for no narrow frith He had to cross .
As when a gryphon through the wilderness With winged course , o ' er hill or moory dale , Pursues the Arimaspian , who by stealth Had from his wakeful custody purloined The guarded gold ; so eagerly the Fiend O ' er bog or steep , through strait , rough , dense , or rare , With head , hands , wings , or feet , pursues his way , And swims , or sinks , or wades , or creeps , or flies .
Yours be th ' advantage all , mine the revenge !"
Thither , full fraught with mischievous revenge , Accursed , and in a cursed hour , he hies .
Only begotten Son , seest thou what rage Transports our Adversary ?
Such I created all the ethereal Powers And Spirits , both them who stood , and them who fail ' d ; Freely they stood who stood , and fell who fell .
The first sort by their own suggestion fell , Self - tempted , self - deprav ' d : Man falls , deceiv ' d By the other first : Man therefore shall find grace , The other none : In mercy and justice both , Through Heaven and Earth , so shall my glory excel ; But Mercy , first and last , shall brightest shine .
Thus while God spake , ambrosial fragrance fill ' d All Heaven , and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus ' d .
Death his death ' s wound shall then receive , and stoop Inglorious , of his mortal sting disarmed ; I through the ample air in triumph high Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell , and show The powers of darkness bound .
Admiration seized All Heaven , what this might mean , and whither tend , Wondering ; but soon th ' Almighty thus replied .
When thou , attended gloriously from Heaven , Shalt in the sky appear , and from thee send The summoning Arch - Angels to proclaim Thy dread tribunal ; forthwith from all winds , The living , and forthwith the cited dead Of all past ages , to the general doom Shall hasten ; such a peal shall rouse their sleep .
Mean while The world shall burn , and from her ashes spring New Heaven and Earth , wherein the just shall dwell , And , after all their tribulations long , See golden days , fruitful of golden deeds , With joy and peace triumphing , and fair truth .
But first he casts to change his proper shape , Which else might work him danger or delay : And now a stripling Cherub he appears , Not of the prime , yet such as in his face Youth smiled celestial , and to every limb Suitable grace diffused , so well he feigned : Under a coronet his flowing hair In curls on either cheek played ; wings he wore Of many a coloured plume , sprinkled with gold ; His habit fit for speed succinct , and held Before his decent steps a silver wand .
Fair Angel , thy desire , which tends to know The works of God , thereby to glorify The great Work - master , leads to no excess That reaches blame , but rather merits praise The more it seems excess , that led thee hither From thy empyreal mansion thus alone , To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps , Contented with report , hear only in Heaven : For wonderful indeed are all his works , Pleasant to know , and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance always with delight ; But what created mind can comprehend Their number , or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth , but hid their causes deep ?
Book IV
Sometimes towards Eden , which now in his view Lay pleasant , his grieved look he fixes sad ; Sometimes towards Heaven , and the full - blazing sun , Which now sat high in his meridian tower : Then , much revolving , thus in sighs began .
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand ?
Thou hadst : whom hast thou then or what to accuse , But Heaven ' s free love dealt equally to all ?
Nay , cursed be thou ; since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues .
Me miserable !
Yet higher than their tops The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung ;
Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill Satan had journeyed on , pensive and slow ; But further way found none , so thick entwined , As one continued brake , the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed All path of man or beast that passed that way .
Beneath him with new wonder now he views , To all delight of human sense exposed , In narrow room , Nature ' s whole wealth , yea more , A Heaven on Earth : For blissful Paradise Of God the garden was , by him in the east Of Eden planted ; Eden stretched her line From Auran eastward to the royal towers Of great Seleucia , built by Grecian kings , Of where the sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar : In this pleasant soil His far more pleasant garden God ordained ; Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow All trees of noblest kind for sight , smell , taste ; And all amid them stood the tree of life , High eminent , blooming ambrosial fruit Of vegetable gold ; and next to life , Our death , the tree of knowledge , grew fast by , Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill . Southward through Eden went a river large , Nor changed his course , but through the shaggy hill Passed underneath ingulfed ; for God had thrown That mountain as his garden - mould high raised Upon the rapid current , which , through veins Of porous earth with kindly thirst up - drawn , Rose a fresh fountain , and with many a rill Watered the garden ; thence united fell Down the steep glade , and met the nether flood , Which from his darksome passage now appears , And now , divided into four main streams , Runs diverse , wandering many a famous realm And country , whereof here needs no account ; But rather to tell how , if Art could tell , How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks , Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold , With mazy errour under pendant shades Ran nectar , visiting each plant , and fed Flowers worthy of Paradise , which not nice Art In beds and curious knots , but Nature boon Poured forth profuse on hill , and dale , and plain , Both where the morning sun first warmly smote The open field , and where the unpierced shade Imbrowned the noontide bowers : Thus was this place A happy rural seat of various view ; Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm , Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind , Hung amiable , Hesperian fables true , If true , here only , and of delicious taste : Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks Grazing the tender herb , were interposed , Or palmy hillock ; or the flowery lap Of some irriguous valley spread her store , Flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose : Another side , umbrageous grots and caves Of cool recess , o ' er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape , and gently creeps Luxuriant ; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills , dispersed , or in a lake , That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned Her crystal mirrour holds , unite their streams .
What could I do , But follow straight , invisibly thus led ?
And do they only stand By ignorance ?
This day at highth of noon came to my sphere A Spirit , zealous , as he seemed , to know More of the Almighty ' s works , and chiefly Man , God ' s latest image : I described his way Bent all on speed , and marked his aery gait ; But in the mount that lies from Eden north , Where he first lighted , soon discerned his looks Alien from Heaven , with passions foul obscured : Mine eye pursued him still , but under shade Lost sight of him : One of the banished crew , I fear , hath ventured from the deep , to raise New troubles ; him thy care must be to find .
When Adam thus to Eve .
To whom thus Eve , with perfect beauty adorned My Author and Disposer , what thou bidst Unargued I obey : So God ordains ; God is thy law , thou mine : To know no more Is woman ' s happiest knowledge , and her praise .
Our Maker bids encrease ; who bids abstain But our Destroyer , foe to God and Man ?
From these , two strong and subtle Spirits he called That near him stood , and gave them thus in charge .
Ithuriel and Zephon , with winged speed Search through this garden , leave unsearched no nook ; But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge , Now laid perhaps asleep , secure of harm .
escaped The bars of Hell , on errand bad no doubt : Such , where ye find , seise fast , and hither bring .
So saying , on he led his radiant files , Dazzling the moon ; these to the bower direct In search of whom they sought : Him there they found Squat like a toad , close at the ear of Eve , Assaying by his devilish art to reach The organs of her fancy , and with them forge Illusions , as he list , phantasms and dreams ; Or if , inspiring venom , he might taint The animal spirits , that from pure blood arise Like gentle breaths from rivers pure , thence raise At least distempered , discontented thoughts , Vain hopes , vain aims , inordinate desires , Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride .
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear Touched lightly ; for no falshood can endure Touch of celestial temper , but returns Of force to its own likeness : Up he starts Discovered and surprised .
Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell Comest thou , escaped thy prison ?
well thou knowest I stood Thy fiercest , when in battle to thy aid The blasting vollied thunder made all speed , And seconded thy else not dreaded spear .
If from this hour Within these hallowed limits thou appear , Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained , And seal thee so , as henceforth not to scorn The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred .
Satan , I know thy strength , and thou knowest mine ; Neither our own , but given : What folly then To boast what arms can do ?
Awake , My fairest , my espoused , my latest found , Heaven ' s last best gift , my ever new delight !
Is knowledge so despised ?
This said , he paused not , but with venturous arm He plucked , he tasted ; me damp horrour chilled At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold : But he thus , overjoyed ; ' O fruit divine , ' Sweet of thyself , but much more sweet thus cropt , ' Forbidden here , it seems , as only fit ' For Gods , yet able to make Gods of Men : ' And why not Gods of Men ; since good , the more ' Communicated , more abundant grows , ' The author not impaired , but honoured more ?
' Here , happy creature , fair angelick Eve !
So saying , he drew nigh , and to me held , Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part Which he had plucked ; the pleasant savoury smell So quickened appetite , that I , methought , Could not but taste .
in thee can harbour none , Created pure .
So all was cleared , and to the field they haste .
Fairest of stars , last in the train of night , If better thou belong not to the dawn , Sure pledge of day , that crownest the smiling morn With thy bright circlet , praise him in thy sphere , While day arises , that sweet hour of prime .
Thou Sun , of this great world both eye and soul , Acknowledge him thy greater ; sound his praise In thy eternal course , both when thou climbest , And when high noon hast gained , and when thou fallest .
Ye Mists and Exhalations , that now rise From hill or steaming lake , dusky or gray , Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold , In honour to the world ' s great Author rise ; Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky , Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers , Rising or falling still advance his praise .
So prayed they innocent , and to their thoughts Firm peace recovered soon , and wonted calm .
But go with speed , And , what thy stores contain , bring forth , and pour Abundance , fit to honour and receive Our heavenly stranger : Well we may afford Our givers their own gifts , and large bestow From large bestowed , where Nature multiplies Her fertile growth , and by disburthening grows More fruitful , which instructs us not to spare .
Adam , earth ' s hallowed mould , Of God inspired !
Adam , I therefore came ; nor art thou such Created , or such place hast here to dwell , As may not oft invite , though Spirits of Heaven , To visit thee ; lead on then where thy bower O ' ershades ; for these mid - hours , till evening rise , I have at will .
So to the sylvan lodge They came , that like Pomona ' s arbour smiled , With flowerets decked , and fragrant smells ; but Eve , Undecked save with herself , more lovely fair Than Wood - Nymph , or the fairest Goddess feigned Of three that in mount Ida naked strove , Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven ; no veil She needed , virtue - proof ; no thought infirm Altered her cheek .
On whom the Angel Hail Bestowed , the holy salutation used Long after to blest Mary , second Eve .
Mean while enjoy Your fill what happiness this happy state Can comprehend , incapable of more .
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied .
Thus Adam made request ; and Raphael , After short pause assenting , thus began .
Mean while the Eternal eye , whose sight discerns Abstrusest thoughts , from forth his holy mount , And from within the golden lamps that burn Nightly before him , saw without their light Rebellion rising ; saw in whom , how spread Among the sons of morn , what multitudes Were banded to oppose his high decree ; And , smiling , to his only Son thus said .
Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven Expected , least of all from thee , Ingrate , In place thyself so high above thy peers .
shalt thou dispute With him the points of liberty , who made Thee what thou art , and formed the Powers of Heaven Such as he pleased , and circumscribed their being ?
He said ; and , as the sound of waters deep , Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause Through the infinite host ; nor less for that The flaming Seraph fearless , though alone Encompassed round with foes , thus answered bold .
So saying , a noble stroke he lifted high , Which hung not , but so swift with tempest fell On the proud crest of Satan , that no sight , Nor motion of swift thought , less could his shield , Such ruin intercept : Ten paces huge He back recoiled ; the tenth on bended knee His massy spear upstaid ; as if on earth Winds under ground , or waters forcing way , Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat , Half sunk with all his pines .
Now storming fury rose , And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now Was never ; arms on armour clashing brayed Horrible discord , and the madding wheels Of brazen chariots raged ; dire was the noise Of conflict ; over head the dismal hiss Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew , And flying vaulted either host with fire .
At his approach The great Arch - Angel from his warlike toil Surceased , and glad , as hoping here to end Intestine war in Heaven , the arch - foe subdued Or captive dragged in chains , with hostile frown And visage all inflamed first thus began .
But think not here To trouble holy rest ; Heaven casts thee out From all her confines .
Hence then , and evil go with thee along , Thy offspring , to the place of evil , Hell ; Thou and thy wicked crew !
On each wing Uriel , and Raphael , his vaunting foe , Though huge , and in a rock of diamond armed , Vanquished Adramelech , and Asmadai , Two potent Thrones , that to be less than Gods Disdained , but meaner thoughts learned in their flight , Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail .
O now in danger tried , now known in arms Not to be overpowered , Companions dear , Found worthy not of liberty alone , Too mean pretence !
Not uninvented that , which thou aright Believest so main to our success , I bring .
Arm , Warriours , arm for fight ; the foe at hand , Whom fled we thought , will save us long pursuit This day ; fear not his flight ; so thick a cloud He comes , and settled in his face I see Sad resolution , and secure : Let each His adamantine coat gird well , and each Fit well his helm , gripe fast his orbed shield , Borne even or high ; for this day will pour down , If I conjecture aught , no drizzling shower , But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire .
Forthwith ( behold the excellence , the power , Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed !)
He said , and on his Son with rays direct Shone full ; he all his Father full expressed Ineffably into his face received ; And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake .
Then shall thy Saints unmixed , and from the impure Far separate , circling thy holy mount , Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing , Hymns of high praise , and I among them Chief .
He , in celestial panoply all armed Of radiant Urim , work divinely wrought , Ascended ; at his right hand Victory Sat eagle - winged ; beside him hung his bow And quiver with three - bolted thunder stored ; And from about him fierce effusion rolled Of smoke , and bickering flame , and sparkles dire : Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints , He onward came ; far off his coming shone ; And twenty thousand ( I their number heard ) Chariots of God , half on each hand , were seen ; He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime On the crystalline sky , in sapphire throned , Illustrious far and wide ; but by his own First seen : Them unexpected joy surprised , When the great ensign of Messiah blazed Aloft by Angels borne , his sign in Heaven ; Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced His army , circumfused on either wing , Under their Head imbodied all in one .
He on his impious foes right onward drove , Gloomy as night ; under his burning wheels The stedfast empyrean shook throughout , All but the throne itself of God .
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell His arrows , from the fourfold - visaged Four Distinct with eyes , and from the living wheels Distinct alike with multitude of eyes ; One Spirit in them ruled ; and every eye Glared lightning , and shot forth pernicious fire Among the accursed , that withered all their strength , And of their wonted vigour left them drained , Exhausted , spiritless , afflicted , fallen .
Yet half his strength he put not forth , but checked His thunder in mid volley ; for he meant Not to destroy , but root them out of Heaven : The overthrown he raised , and as a herd Of goats or timorous flock together thronged Drove them before him thunder - struck , pursued With terrours , and with furies , to the bounds And crystal wall of Heaven ; which , opening wide , Rolled inward , and a spacious gap disclosed Into the wasteful deep : The monstrous sight Struck them with horrour backward , but far worse Urged them behind : Headlong themselves they threw Down from the verge of Heaven ; eternal wrath Burnt after them to the bottomless pit .
Up led by thee Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed , An earthly guest , and drawn empyreal air , Thy tempering : with like safety guided down Return me to my native element : Lest from this flying steed unreined , ( as once Bellerophon , though from a lower clime ,) Dismounted , on the Aleian field I fall , Erroneous there to wander , and forlorn .
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his revellers , the race Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard In Rhodope , where woods and rocks had ears To rapture , till the savage clamour drowned Both harp and voice ; nor could the Muse defend Her son .
Great things , and full of wonder in our ears , Far differing from this world , thou hast revealed , Divine interpreter !
And the great light of day yet wants to run Much of his race though steep ; suspense in Heaven , Held by thy voice , thy potent voice , he hears , And longer will delay to hear thee tell His generation , and the rising birth Of Nature from the unapparent Deep : Or if the star of evening and the moon Haste to thy audience , Night with her will bring , Silence ; and Sleep , listening to thee , will watch ; Or we can bid his absence , till thy song End , and dismiss thee ere the morning shine .
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought : And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild .
But knowledge is as food , and needs no less Her temperance over appetite , to know In measure what the mind may well contain ; Oppresses else with surfeit , and soon turns Wisdom to folly , as nourishment to wind .
Though I , uncircumscribed myself , retire , And put not forth my goodness , which is free To act or not , Necessity and Chance Approach not me , and what I will is Fate .
On heavenly ground they stood ; and from the shore They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss Outrageous as a sea , dark , wasteful , wild , Up from the bottom turned by furious winds And surging waves , as mountains , to assault Heaven ' s highth , and with the center mix the pole .
Nor staid ; but , on the wings of Cherubim Uplifted , in paternal glory rode Far into Chaos , and the world unborn ; For Chaos heard his voice : Him all his train Followed in bright procession , to behold Creation , and the wonders of his might .
Thus was the first day even and morn : Nor past uncelebrated , nor unsung By the celestial quires , when orient light Exhaling first from darkness they beheld ; Birth - day of Heaven and Earth ; with joy and shout The hollow universal orb they filled , And touched their golden harps , and hymning praised God and his works ; Creator him they sung , Both when first evening was , and when first morn .
Hither , as to their fountain , other stars Repairing , in their golden urns draw light , And hence the morning - planet gilds her horns ; By tincture or reflection they augment Their small peculiar , though from human sight So far remote , with diminution seen , First in his east the glorious lamp was seen , Regent of day , and all the horizon round Invested with bright rays , jocund to run His longitude through Heaven ' s high road ; the gray Dawn , and the Pleiades , before him danced , Shedding sweet influence : Less bright the moon , But opposite in levelled west was set , His mirrour , with full face borrowing her light From him ; for other light she needed none In that aspect , and still that distance keeps Till night ; then in the east her turn she shines , Revolved on Heaven ' s great axle , and her reign With thousand lesser lights dividual holds , With thousand thousand stars , that then appeared Spangling the hemisphere : Then first adorned With their bright luminaries that set and rose , Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day .
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground , Insect or worm : those waved their limber fans For wings , and smallest lineaments exact In all the liveries decked of summer ' s pride With spots of gold and purple , azure and green : These , as a line , their long dimension drew , Streaking the ground with sinuous trace ; not all Minims of nature ; some of serpent - kind , Wonderous in length and corpulence , involved Their snaky folds , and added wings .
thus to his Son audibly spake .
Open , ye everlasting gates !
they sung , Open , ye Heavens !
Who seeks To lessen thee , against his purpose serves To manifest the more thy might : his evil Thou usest , and from thence createst more good .
And thy request think now fulfilled , that asked How first this world and face of things began , And what before thy memory was done From the beginning ; that posterity , Informed by thee , might know : If else thou seekest Aught , not surpassing human measure , say .
Book VIII
Thee I have heard relating what was done Ere my remembrance : now , hear me relate My story , which perhaps thou hast not heard ; And day is not yet spent ; till then thou seest How subtly to detain thee I devise ; Inviting thee to hear while I relate ; Fond !
For Man to tell how human life began Is hard ; for who himself beginning knew Desire with thee still longer to converse Induced me .
Myself I then perused , and limb by limb Surveyed , and sometimes went , and sometimes ran With supple joints , as lively vigour led : But who I was , or where , or from what cause , Knew not ; to speak I tried , and forthwith spake ; My tongue obeyed , and readily could name Whate ' er I saw .
' This Paradise I give thee , count it thine ' To till and keep , and of the fruit to eat : ' Of every tree that in the garden grows ' Eat freely with glad heart ; fear here no dearth : ' But of the tree whose operation brings ' Knowledge of good and ill , which I have set ' The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith , ' Amid the garden by the tree of life , ' Remember what I warn thee , shun to taste , ' And shun the bitter consequence : for know , ' The day thou eatest thereof , my sole command ' Transgressed , inevitably thou shalt die , ' From that day mortal ; and this happy state ' Shalt lose , expelled from hence into a world ' Of woe and sorrow .'
Thus I presumptuous ; and the Vision bright , As with a smile more brightened , thus replied .
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute , And these inferiour far beneath me set ?
Among unequals what society Can sort , what harmony , or true delight ?
A nice and subtle happiness , I see , Thou to thyself proposest , in the choice Of thy associates , Adam !
To attain The highth and depth of thy eternal ways All human thoughts come short , Supreme of things !
No need that thou Shouldst propagate , already Infinite ; And through all numbers absolute , though One : But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection , and beget Like of his like , his image multiplied , In unity defective ; which requires Collateral love , and dearest amity .
Mine eyes he closed , but open left the cell Of fancy , my internal sight ; by which , Abstract as in a trance , methought I saw , Though sleeping , where I lay , and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood : Who stooping opened my left side , and took From thence a rib , with cordial spirits warm , And life - blood streaming fresh ; wide was the wound , But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed : The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands ; Under his forming hands a creature grew , Man - like , but different sex ; so lovely fair , That what seemed fair in all the world , seemed now Mean , or in her summed up , in her contained And in her looks ; which from that time infused Sweetness into my heart , unfelt before , And into all things from her air inspired The spirit of love and amorous delight .
I now see Bone of my bone , flesh of my flesh , myself Before me : Woman is her name ; of Man Extracted : for this cause he shall forego Father and mother , and to his wife adhere ; And they shall be one flesh , one heart , one soul .
in all enjoyments else Superiour and unmoved ; here only weak Against the charm of Beauty ' s powerful glance .
For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her the inferiour , in the mind And inward faculties , which most excel ; In outward also her resembling less His image who made both , and less expressing The character of that dominion given O ' er other creatures : Yet when I approach Her loveliness , so absolute she seems And in herself complete , so well to know Her own , that what she wills to do or say , Seems wisest , virtuousest , discreetest , best : All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded ; Wisdom in discourse with her Loses discountenanced , and like Folly shows ; Authority and Reason on her wait , As one intended first , not after made Occasionally ; and , to consummate all , Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat Build in her loveliest , and create an awe About her , as a guard angelick placed .
fair , no doubt , and worthy well Thy cherishing , thy honouring , and thy love ; Not thy subjection : Weigh with her thyself ; Then value : Oft - times nothing profits more Than self - esteem , grounded on just and right Well managed ; of that skill the more thou knowest , The more she will acknowledge thee her head , And to realities yield all her shows : Made so adorn for thy delight the more , So awful , that with honour thou mayest love Thy mate , who sees when thou art seen least wise .
or do they mix Irradiance , virtual or immediate touch ?
Thus he resolved , but first from inward grief His bursting passion into plaints thus poured .
But I in none of these Find place or refuge ; and the more I see Pleasures about me , so much more I feel Torment within me , as from the hateful siege Of contraries : all good to me becomes Bane , and in Heaven much worse would be my state .
Revenge , at first though sweet , Bitter ere long , back on itself recoils : Let it ; I reck not , so it light well aimed , Since higher I fall short , on him who next Provokes my envy , this new favourite Of Heaven , this man of clay , son of despite , Whom , us the more to spite , his Maker raised From dust : Spite then with spite is best repaid .
So saying , through each thicket dank or dry , Like a black mist low - creeping , he held on His midnight - search , where soonest he might find The serpent ; him fast - sleeping soon he found In labyrinth of many a round self - rolled , His head the midst , well stored with subtile wiles : Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den , Nor nocent yet ; but , on the grassy herb , Fearless unfeared he slept : in at his mouth The Devil entered ; and his brutal sense , In heart or head , possessing , soon inspired With act intelligential ; but his sleep Disturbed not , waiting close the approach of morn .
Now , when as sacred light began to dawn In Eden on the humid flowers , that breathed Their morning incense , when all things , that breathe , From the Earth ' s great altar send up silent praise To the Creator , and his nostrils fill With grateful smell , forth came the human pair , And joined their vocal worship to the quire Of creatures wanting voice ; that done , partake The season prime for sweetest scents and airs : Then commune , how that day they best may ply Their growing work : for much their work out - grew The hands ' dispatch of two gardening so wide , And Eve first to her husband thus began .
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed Labour , as to debar us when we need Refreshment , whether food , or talk between , Food of the mind , or this sweet intercourse Of looks and smiles ; for smiles from reason flow , To brute denied , and are of love the food ; Love , not the lowest end of human life .
The wife , where danger or dishonour lurks , Safest and seemliest by her husband stays , Who guards her , or with her the worst endures .
If this be our condition , thus to dwell In narrow circuit straitened by a foe , Subtle or violent , we not endued Single with like defence , wherever met ; How are we happy , still in fear of harm ?
And what is faith , love , virtue , unassayed Alone , without exteriour help sustained ?
Let us not then suspect our happy state Left so imperfect by the Maker wise , As not secure to single or combined .
To Pales , or Pomona , thus adorned , Likest she seemed , Pomona when she fled Vertumnus , or to Ceres in her prime , Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove .
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued Delighted , but desiring more her stay .
Oft he to her his charge of quick return Repeated ; she to him as oft engaged To be returned by noon amid the bower , And all things in best order to invite Noontide repast , or afternoon ' s repose .
Thoughts , whither have ye led me !
Not terrible , though terrour be in love And beauty , not approached by stronger hate , Hate stronger , under show of love well feigned ; The way which to her ruin now I tend .
He , bolder now , uncalled before her stood , But as in gaze admiring : oft he bowed His turret crest , and sleek enamelled neck , Fawning ; and licked the ground whereon she trod .
His gentle dumb expression turned at length The eye of Eve to mark his play ; he , glad Of her attention gained , with serpent - tongue Organick , or impulse of vocal air , His fraudulent temptation thus began .
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair , Thee all things living gaze on , all things thine By gift , and thy celestial beauty adore With ravishment beheld !
who should be seen A Goddess among Gods , adored and served By Angels numberless , thy daily train .
For many are the trees of God that grow In Paradise , and various , yet unknown To us ; in such abundance lies our choice , As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched , Still hanging incorruptible , till men Grow up to their provision , and more hands Help to disburden Nature of her birth .
Empress , the way is ready , and not long ; Beyond a row of myrtles , on a flat , Fast by a fountain , one small thicket past Of blowing myrrh and balm : if thou accept My conduct , I can bring thee thither soon Lead then , said Eve .
hath God then said that of the fruit Of all these garden - trees ye shall not eat , Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air $?
O sacred , wise , and wisdom - giving Plant , Mother of science !
Queen of this universe !
do not believe Those rigid threats of death : ye shall not die : How should you ?
or will God incense his ire For such a petty trespass ?
Why , but to awe ; Why , but to keep ye low and ignorant , His worshippers ?
Or is it envy ?
Such prohibitions bind not .
What fear I then ?
shall I to him make known As yet my change , and give him to partake Full happiness with me , or rather not , But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power Without copartner ?
so to add what wants In female sex , the more to draw his love , And render me more equal ; and perhaps , A thing not undesirable , sometime Superiour ; for , inferiour , who is free This may be well : But what if God have seen , And death ensue ?
then I shall be no more !
And Adam , wedded to another Eve , Shall live with her enjoying , I extinct ; A death to think !
But strange Hath been the cause , and wonderful to hear : This tree is not , as we are told , a tree Of danger tasted , nor to evil unknown Opening the way , but of divine effect To open eyes , and make them Gods who taste ; And hath been tasted such : The serpent wise , Or not restrained as we , or not obeying , Hath eaten of the fruit ; and is become , Not dead , as we are threatened , but thenceforth Endued with human voice and human sense , Reasoning to admiration ; and with me Persuasively hath so prevailed , that I Have also tasted , and have also found The effects to correspond ; opener mine eyes , Dim erst , dilated spirits , ampler heart , And growing up to Godhead ; which for thee Chiefly I sought , without thee can despise .
Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told ; But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed .
O fairest of Creation , last and best Of all God ' s works , Creature in whom excelled Whatever can to sight or thought be formed , Holy , divine , good , amiable , or sweet !
O glorious trial of exceeding love , Illustrious evidence , example high !
Engaging me to emulate ; but , short Of thy perfection , how shall I attain , Adam , from whose dear side I boast me sprung , And gladly of our union hear thee speak , One heart , one soul in both ; whereof good proof This day affords , declaring thee resolved , Rather than death , or aught than death more dread , Shall separate us , linked in love so dear , To undergo with me one guilt , one crime , If any be , of tasting this fair fruit ; Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds , Direct , or by occasion , hath presented This happy trial of thy love , which else So eminently never had been known ?
Earth trembled from her entrails , as again In pangs ; and Nature gave a second groan ; Sky loured ; and , muttering thunder , some sad drops Wept at completing of the mortal sin Original : while Adam took no thought , Eating his fill ; nor Eve to iterate Her former trespass feared , the more to sooth Him with her loved society ; that now , As with new wine intoxicated both , They swim in mirth , and fancy that they feel Divinity within them breeding wings , Wherewith to scorn the earth : But that false fruit Far other operation first displayed , Carnal desire inflaming ; he on Eve Began to cast lascivious eyes ; she him As wantonly repaid ; in lust they burn : Till Adam thus ' gan Eve to dalliance move .
Eve , now I see thou art exact of taste , And elegant , of sapience no small part ; Since to each meaning savour we apply , And palate call judicious ; I the praise Yield thee , so well this day thou hast purveyed .
So said he , and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent ; well understood Of Eve , whose eye darted contagious fire .
Was I to have never parted from thy side ?
Mean while the heinous and despiteful act Of Satan , done in Paradise ; and how He , in the serpent , had perverted Eve , Her husband she , to taste the fatal fruit , Was known in Heaven ; for what can ' scape the eye Of God all - seeing , or deceive his heart Omniscient ?
who , in all things wise and just , Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind Of Man , with strength entire and free will armed , Complete to have discovered and repulsed Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend .
For still they knew , and ought to have still remembered , The high injunction , not to taste that fruit , Whoever tempted ; which they not obeying , ( Incurred what could they less ?)
Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste The angelick guards ascended , mute , and sad , For Man ; for of his state by this they knew , Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen Entrance unseen .
Father Eternal , thine is to decree ; Mine , both in Heaven and Earth , to do thy will Supreme ; that thou in me , thy Son beloved , Mayest ever rest well pleased .
Attendance none shall need , nor train , where none Are to behold the judgement , but the judged , Those two ; the third best absent is condemned , Convict by flight , and rebel to all law : Conviction to the serpent none belongs .
That thou art naked , who Hath told thee ?
Was she thy God , that her thou didst obey Before his voice ?
So having said , he thus to Eve in few .
To whom sad Eve , with shame nigh overwhelmed , Confessing soon , yet not before her Judge Bold or loquacious , thus abashed replied .
So judged he Man , both Judge and Saviour sent ; And the instant stroke of death , denounced that day , Removed far off ; then , pitying how they stood Before him naked to the air , that now Must suffer change , disdained not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume ; As when he washed his servants feet ; so now , As father of his family , he clad Their nakedness with skins of beasts , or slain , Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid ; And thought not much to clothe his enemies ; Nor he their outward only with the skins Of beasts , but inward nakedness , much more .
Mean while , ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth , Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death , In counterview within the gates , that now Stood open wide , belching outrageous flame Far into Chaos , since the Fiend passed through , Sin opening ; who thus now to Death began .
But , lest the difficulty of passing back Stay his return perhaps over this gulf Impassable , impervious ; let us try Adventurous work , yet to thy power and mine Not unagreeable , to found a path Over this main from Hell to that new world , Where Satan now prevails ; a monument Of merit high to all the infernal host , Easing their passage hence , for intercourse , Or transmigration , as their lot shall lead .
Then both from out Hell - gates , into the waste Wide anarchy of Chaos , damp and dark , Flew diverse ; and with power ( their power was great ) Hovering upon the waters , what they met Solid or slimy , as in raging sea Tost up and down , together crouded drove , From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell ; As when two polar winds , blowing adverse Upon the Cronian sea , together drive Mountains of ice , that stop the imagined way Beyond Petsora eastward , to the rich Cathaian coast .
Now had they brought the work by wonderous art Pontifical , a ridge of pendant rock , Over the vexed abyss , following the track Of Satan to the self - same place where he First lighted from his wing , and landed safe From out of Chaos , to the outside bare Of this round world : With pins of adamant And chains they made all fast , too fast they made And durable !
O Parent , these are thy magnifick deeds , Thy trophies !
So having said , a while he stood , expecting Their universal shout , and high applause , To fill his ear ; when , contrary , he hears On all sides , from innumerable tongues , A dismal universal hiss , the sound Of publick scorn ; he wondered , but not long Had leisure , wondering at himself now more , His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare ; His arms clung to his ribs ; his legs entwining Each other , till supplanted down he fell A monstrous serpent on his belly prone , Reluctant , but in vain ; a greater power Now ruled him , punished in the shape he sinned , According to his doom : he would have spoke , But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue To forked tongue ; for now were all transformed Alike , to serpents all , as accessories To his bold riot : Dreadful was the din Of hissing through the hall , thick swarming now With complicated monsters head and tail , Scorpion , and Asp , and Amphisbaena dire , Cerastes horned , Hydrus , and Elops drear , And Dipsas ; ( not so thick swarmed once the soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon , or the isle Ophiusa ,) but still greatest he the midst , Now Dragon grown , larger than whom the sun Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime , Huge Python , and his power no less he seemed Above the rest still to retain ; they all Him followed , issuing forth to the open field , Where all yet left of that revolted rout , Heaven - fallen , in station stood or just array ; Sublime with expectation when to see In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief ; They saw , but other sight instead !
There stood A grove hard by , sprung up with this their change , His will who reigns above , to aggravate Their penance , laden with fair fruit , like that Which grew in Paradise , the bait of Eve Used by the Tempter : on that prospect strange Their earnest eyes they fixed , imagining For one forbidden tree a multitude Now risen , to work them further woe or shame ; Yet , parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce , Though to delude them sent , could not abstain ; But on they rolled in heaps , and , up the trees Climbing , sat thicker than the snaky locks That curled Megaera : greedily they plucked The fruitage fair to sight , like that which grew Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed ; This more delusive , not the touch , but taste Deceived ; they , fondly thinking to allay Their appetite with gust , instead of fruit Chewed bitter ashes , which the offended taste With spattering noise rejected : oft they assayed , Hunger and thirst constraining ; drugged as oft , With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws , With soot and cinders filled ; so oft they fell Into the same illusion , not as Man Whom they triumphed once lapsed .
However , some tradition they dispersed Among the Heathen , of their purchase got , And fabled how the Serpent , whom they called Ophion , with Eurynome , the wide -- Encroaching Eve perhaps , had first the rule Of high Olympus ; thence by Saturn driven And Ops , ere yet Dictaean Jove was born .
and , whatever thing The sithe of Time mows down , devour unspared ; Till I , in Man residing , through the race , His thoughts , his looks , words , actions , all infect ; And season him thy last and sweetest prey .
Thus began Outrage from lifeless things ; but Discord first , Daughter of Sin , among the irrational Death introduced , through fierce antipathy : Beast now with beast ' gan war , and fowl with fowl , And fish with fish ; to graze the herb all leaving , Devoured each other ; nor stood much in awe Of Man , but fled him ; or , with countenance grim , Glared on him passing .
O miserable of happy !
Is this the end Of this new glorious world , and me so late The glory of that glory , who now become Accursed , of blessed ?
O fleeting joys Of Paradise , dear bought with lasting woes !
Be it , Man is not so , But mortal doomed .
That were to extend His sentence beyond dust and Nature ' s law ; By which all causes else , according still To the reception of their matter , act ; Not to the extent of their own sphere .
But say That death be not one stroke , as I supposed , Bereaving sense , but endless misery From this day onward ; which I feel begun Both in me , and without me ; and so last To perpetuity ;-- Ay me ! that fear Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution On my defenceless head ; both Death and I Am found eternal , and incorporate both ; Nor I on my part single ; in me all Posterity stands cursed : Fair patrimony That I must leave ye , Sons !
O , were I able To waste it all myself , and leave ye none !
Ah , why should all mankind , For one man ' s fault , thus guiltless be condemned , It guiltless ?
Him , after all disputes , Forced I absolve : all my evasions vain , And reasonings , though through mazes , lead me still But to my own conviction : first and last On me , me only , as the source and spring Of all corruption , all the blame lights due ; So might the wrath !
Thus , what thou desirest , And what thou fearest , alike destroys all hope Of refuge , and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future ; To Satan only like both crime and doom .
Why comes not Death , Said he , with one thrice - acceptable stroke To end me ?
With other echo late I taught your shades To answer , and resound far other song .-- Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld , Desolate where she sat , approaching nigh , Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed : But her with stern regard he thus repelled .
She ended weeping ; and her lowly plight , Immoveable , till peace obtained from fault Acknowledged and deplored , in Adam wrought Commiseration : Soon his heart relented Towards her , his life so late , and sole delight , Now at his feet submissive in distress ; Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking , His counsel , whom she had displeased , his aid : As one disarmed , his anger all he lost , And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon .
If prayers Could alter high decrees , I to that place Would speed before thee , and be louder heard , That on my head all might be visited ; Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven , To me committed , and by me exposed .
unless Be meant , whom I conjecture , our grand foe , Satan ; who , in the serpent , hath contrived Against us this deceit : To crush his head Would be revenge indeed !
Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard , and judged , Without wrath or reviling ; we expected Immediate dissolution , which we thought Was meant by death that day ; when lo ! to thee Pains only in child - bearing were foretold , And bringing forth ; soon recompensed with joy , Fruit of thy womb : On me the curse aslope Glanced on the ground ; with labour I must earn My bread ; what harm ?
Which now the sky , with various face , begins To show us in this mountain ; while the winds Blow moist and keen , shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading trees ; which bids us seek Some better shroud , some better warmth to cherish Our limbs benummed , ere this diurnal star Leave cold the night , how we his gathered beams Reflected may with matter sere foment ; Or , by collision of two bodies , grind The air attrite to fire ; as late the clouds Justling , or pushed with winds , rude in their shock , Tine the slant lightning ; whose thwart flame , driven down Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine ; And sends a comfortable heat from far , Which might supply the sun : Such fire to use , And what may else be remedy or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought , He will instruct us praying , and of grace Beseeching him ; so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life , sustained By him with many comforts , till we end In dust , our final rest and native home .
What better can we do , than , to the place Repairing where he judged us , prostrate fall Before him reverent ; and there confess Humbly our faults , and pardon beg ; with tears Watering the ground , and with our sighs the air Frequenting , sent from hearts contrite , in sign Of sorrow unfeigned , and humiliation meek
Thus they , in lowliest plight , repentant stood Praying ; for from the mercy - seat above Prevenient grace descending had removed The stony from their hearts , and made new flesh Regenerate grow instead ; that sighs now breathed Unutterable ; which the Spirit of prayer Inspired , and winged for Heaven with speedier flight Than loudest oratory : Yet their port Not of mean suitors ; nor important less Seemed their petition , than when the ancient pair In fables old , less ancient yet than these , Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha , to restore The race of mankind drowned , before the shrine Of Themis stood devout .
All thy request for Man , accepted Son , Obtain ; all thy request was my decree : But , longer in that Paradise to dwell , The law I gave to Nature him forbids : Those pure immortal elements , that know , No gross , no unharmonious mixture foul , Eject him , tainted now ; and purge him off , As a distemper , gross , to air as gross , And mortal food ; as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by sin , that first Distempered all things , and of incorrupt Corrupted .
I , at first , with two fair gifts Created him endowed ; with happiness , And immortality : that fondly lost , This other served but to eternize woe ; Till I provided death : so death becomes His final remedy ; and , after life , Tried in sharp tribulation , and refined By faith and faithful works , to second life , Waked in the renovation of the just , Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed .
But let us call to synod all the Blest , Through Heaven ' s wide bounds : from them I will not hide My judgements ; how with mankind I proceed , As how with peccant Angels late they saw , And in their state , though firm , stood more confirmed .
If patiently thy bidding they obey , Dismiss them not disconsolate ; reveal To Adam what shall come in future days , As I shall thee enlighten ; intermix My covenant in the Woman ' s seed renewed ; So send them forth , though sorrowing , yet in peace : And on the east side of the garden place , Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs , Cherubick watch ; and of a sword the flame Wide - waving ; all approach far off to fright , And guard all passage to the tree of life : Lest Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foul , and all my trees their prey ; With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude .
He ceased ; and the arch - angelick Power prepared For swift descent ; with him the cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim : four faces each Had , like a double Janus ; all their shape Spangled with eyes more numerous than those Of Argus , and more wakeful than to drouse , Charmed with Arcadian pipe , the pastoral reed Of Hermes , or his opiate rod .
Adam observed , and with his eye the chase Pursuing , not unmoved , to Eve thus spake .
or more than this , that we are dust , And thither must return , and be no more ?
He erred not ; for by this the heavenly bands Down from a sky of jasper lighted now In Paradise , and on a hill made halt ; A glorious apparition , had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam ' s eye .
Not that more glorious , when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim , where he saw The field pavilioned with his guardians bright ; Nor that , which on the flaming mount appeared In Dothan , covered with a camp of fire , Against the Syrian king , who to surprise One man , assassin - like , had levied war , War unproclaimed .
The princely Hierarch In their bright stand there left his Powers , to seise Possession of the garden ; he alone , To find where Adam sheltered , took his way , Not unperceived of Adam ; who to Eve , While the great visitant approached , thus spake .
Adam bowed low ; he , kingly , from his state Inclined not , but his coming thus declared .
from thee How shall I part , and whither wander down Into a lower world ; to this obscure And wild ?
It was a hill , Of Paradise the highest ; from whose top The hemisphere of earth , in clearest ken , Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay .
To which our sire .
rather , why Obtruded on us thus ?
But is there yet no other way , besides These painful passages , how we may come To death , and mix with our connatural dust ?
A bevy of fair women , richly gay In gems and wanton dress ; to the harp they sung Soft amorous ditties , and in dance came on : The men , though grave , eyed them ; and let their eyes Rove without rein ; till , in the amorous net Fast caught , they liked ; and each his liking chose ; And now of love they treat , till the evening - star , Love ' s harbinger , appeared ; then , all in heat They light the nuptial torch , and bid invoke Hymen , then first to marriage rites invoked : With feast and musick all the tents resound .
How didst thou grieve then , Adam , to behold The end of all thy offspring , end so sad , Depopulation !
O visions ill foreseen !
Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold , what shall befall Him or his children ; evil he may be sure , Which neither his foreknowing can prevent ; And he the future evil shall no less In apprehension than in substance feel , Grievous to bear : but that care now is past , Man is not whom to warn : those few escaped Famine and anguish will at last consume , Wandering that watery desart : I had hope , When violence was ceased , and war on earth , All would have then gone well ; peace would have crowned With length of happy days the race of Man ; But I was far deceived ; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste .
The conquered also , and enslaved by war , Shall , with their freedom lost , all virtue lose And fear of God ; from whom their piety feigned In sharp contest of battle found no aid Against invaders ; therefore , cooled in zeal , Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure , Worldly or dissolute , on what their lords Shall leave them to enjoy ; for the earth shall bear More than enough , that temperance may be tried : So all shall turn degenerate , all depraved ; Justice and temperance , truth and faith , forgot ; One man except , the only son of light In a dark age , against example good , Against allurement , custom , and a world Offended : fearless of reproach and scorn , The grand - child , with twelve sons encreased , departs From Canaan , to a land hereafter called Egypt , divided by the river Nile ; See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths Into the sea : To sojourn in that land He comes , invited by a younger son In time of dearth ; a son , whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that realm Of Pharaoh : There he dies , and leaves his race Growing into a nation , and now grown Suspected to a sequent king , who seeks To stop their overgrowth , as inmate guests Or violence , he of their wicked ways Shall them admonish ; and before them set The paths of righteousness , how much more safe And full of peace ; denouncing wrath to come On their impenitence ; and shall return Of them derided , but of God observed The one just man alive ; by his command Shall build a wonderous ark , as thou beheldst , To save himself , and houshold , from amidst A world devote to universal wrack .
And now , what further shall ensue , behold .
I revive At this last sight ; assured that Man shall live , With all the creatures , and their seed preserve .
Much thou hast yet to see ; but I perceive Thy mortal sight to fail ; objects divine Must needs impair and weary human sense : Henceforth what is to come I will relate ; Thou therefore give due audience , and attend .
so to aspire Above his brethren ; to himself assuming Authority usurped , from God not given : He gave us only over beast , fish , fowl , Dominion absolute ; that right we hold By his donation ; but man over men He made not lord ; such title to himself Reserving , human left from human free .
To whom thus Michael .
Therefore , since he permits Within himself unworthy powers to reign Over free reason , God , in judgement just , Subjects him from without to violent lords ; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom : Tyranny must be ; Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse .
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low From virtue , which is reason , that no wrong , But justice , and some fatal curse annexed , Deprives them of their outward liberty ; Their inward lost : Witness the irreverent son Of him who built the ark ; who , for the shame Done to his father , heard this heavy curse , Servant of servants , on his vicious race .
Canaan he now attains ; I see his tents Pitched about Sechem , and the neighbouring plain Of Moreh ; there by promise he receives Gift to his progeny of all that land , From Hameth northward to the Desart south ; ( Things by their names I call , though yet unnamed ;) From Hermon east to the great western Sea ; Mount Hermon , yonder sea ; each place behold In prospect , as I point them ; on the shore Mount Carmel ; here , the double - founted stream , Jordan , true limit eastward ; but his sons Shall dwell to Senir , that long ridge of hills .
This ponder , that all nations of the earth Shall in his seed be blessed : By that seed Is meant thy great Deliverer , who shall bruise The Serpent ' s head ; whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be revealed .
This patriarch blest , Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call , A son , and of his son a grand - child , leaves ; Like him in faith , in wisdom , and renown : The grandchild , with twelve sons increased , departs From Canaan to a land hereafter called Egypt , divided by the river Nile See where it flows , disgorging at seven mouths Into the sea .
Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them , as of thee begot ; And therefore was law given them , to evince Their natural pravity , by stirring up Sin against law to fight : that when they see Law can discover sin , but not remove , Save by those shadowy expiations weak , The blood of bulls and goats , they may conclude Some blood more precious must be paid for Man ; Just for unjust ; that , in such righteousness To them by faith imputed , they may find Justification towards God , and peace Of conscience ; which the law by ceremonies Cannot appease ; nor Man the mortal part Perform ; and , not performing , cannot live .
A virgin is his mother , but his sire The power of the Most High : He shall ascend The throne hereditary , and bound his reign With Earth ' s wide bounds , his glory with the Heavens .
For this he shall live hated , be blasphemed , Seised on by force , judged , and to death condemned A shameful and accursed , nailed to the cross By his own nation ; slain for bringing life : But to the cross he nails thy enemies , The law that is against thee , and the sins Of all mankind , with him there crucified , Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction ; so he dies , But soon revives ; Death over him no power Shall long usurp ; ere the third dawning light Return , the stars of morn shall see him rise Out of his grave , fresh as the dawning light , Thy ransom paid , which Man from death redeems , His death for Man , as many as offered life Neglect not , and the benefit embrace By faith not void of works : This God - like act Annuls thy doom , the death thou shouldest have died , In sin for ever lost from life ; this act Shall bruise the head of Satan , crush his strength , Defeating Sin and Death , his two main arms ; And fix far deeper in his head their stings Than temporal death shall bruise the victor ' s heel , Or theirs whom he redeems ; a death , like sleep , A gentle wafting to immortal life .
But say , if our Deliverer up to Heaven Must re - ascend , what will betide the few His faithful , left among the unfaithful herd , The enemies of truth ?
Will they not deal Worse with his followers than with him they dealt ?
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names , Places , and titles , and with these to join Secular power ; though feigning still to act By spiritual , to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God , promised alike and given To all believers ; and , from that pretence , Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force On every conscience ; laws which none shall find Left them inrolled , or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave .
what , but unbuild His living temples , built by faith to stand , Their own faith , not another ' s ?
Greatly - instructed I shall hence depart ; Greatly in peace of thought ; and have my fill Of knowledge , what this vessel can contain ; Beyond which was my folly to aspire .

Therefore good Brutus , be prepar ' d to heare : And since you know , you cannot see your selfe So well as by Reflection ; I your Glasse , Will modestly discouer to your selfe That of your selfe , which you yet know not of .
Why should that name be sounded more then yours Write them together : Yours , is as faire a Name : Sound them , it doth become the mouth aswell : Weigh them , it is as heauy : Coniure with ' em , Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar .

Tell vs the manner of it , gentle Caska
I can as well bee hang ' d as tell the manner of it : It was meere Foolerie , I did not marke it .
No , Caesar hath it not : but you , and I , And honest Caska , we haue the Falling sicknesse
Marry , before he fell downe , when he perceiu ' d the common Heard was glad he refus ' d the Crowne , he pluckt me ope his Doublet , and offer ' d them his Throat to cut : and I had beene a man of any Occupation , if I would not haue taken him at a word , I would I might goe to Hell among the Rogues , and so hee fell .

Nor Stonie Tower , nor Walls of beaten Brasse , Nor ayre - lesse Dungeon , nor strong Linkes of Iron , Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit : But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres , Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe .

And will he steale out of his wholsome bed To dare the vile contagion of the Night ?
No my Brutus , You haue some sicke Offence within your minde , Which by the Right and Vertue of my place I ought to know of : And vpon my knees , I charme you , by my once commended Beauty , By all your vowes of Loue , and that great Vow Which did incorporate and make vs one , That you vnfold to me , your selfe ; your halfe Why you are heauy : and what men to night Haue had resort to you : for heere haue beene Some sixe or seuen , who did hide their faces Euen from darknesse

But for your priuate satisfaction , Because I loue you , I will let you know .

Onely be patient , till we haue appeas ' d The Multitude , beside themselues with feare , And then , we will deliuer you the cause , Why I , that did loue Caesar when I strooke him , Haue thus proceeded
I doubt not of your Wisedome : Let each man render me his bloody hand .
That I did loue thee Caesar , O ' tis true : If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now , Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death , To see thy Antony making his peace , Shaking the bloody fingers of thy Foes ?
Pardon me Iulius , heere was ' t thou bay ' d braue Hart , Heere did ' st thou fall , and heere thy Hunters stand Sign ' d in thy Spoyle , and Crimson ' d in thy Lethee .

Pardon me Caius Cassius : The Enemies of Caesar , shall say this : Then , in a Friend , it is cold Modestie
Cassi .
But what compact meane you to haue with vs ?
Will you be prick ' d in number of our Friends , Or shall we on , and not depend on you ?
Therefore I tooke your hands , but was indeed Sway ' d from the point , by looking downe on Caesar .

But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my Prison - House ; I could a Tale vnfold , whose lightest word Would harrow vp thy soule , freeze thy young blood , Make thy two eyes like Starres , start from their Spheres , Thy knotty and combined lockes to part , And each particular haire to stand an end , Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine : But this eternall blason must not be To eares of flesh and bloud ; list Hamlet , oh list , If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue
Ham .
Gho .
But soft , me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre ; Briefe let me be : Sleeping within mine Orchard , My custome alwayes in the afternoone ; Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl , And in the Porches of mine eares did poure The leaperous Distilment ; whose effect Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man , That swift as Quick - siluer , it courses through The naturall Gates and Allies of the body ; And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset And curd , like Aygre droppings into Milke , The thin and wholsome blood : so did it mine ; And a most instant Tetter bak ' d about , Most Lazar - like , with vile and loathsome crust , All my smooth Body .
Yea , from the Table of my Memory , Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records , All sawes of Bookes , all formes , all presures past , That youth and obseruation coppied there ; And thy Commandment all alone shall liue Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine , Vnmixt with baser matter ; yes yes , by Heauen : Oh most pernicious woman !
Oh Villaine , Villaine , smiling damned Villaine !

Oh day and night : but this is wondrous strange
Ham .
I will my Lord
I , or drinking , fencing , swearing , Quarelling , drabbing .
You may goe so farre
Faith no , as you may season it in the charge ; You must not put another scandall on him , That hee is open to Incontinencie ; That ' s not my meaning : but breath his faults so quaintly , That they may seeme the taints of liberty ; The flash and out - breake of a fiery minde , A sauagenes in vnreclaim ' d bloud of generall assault
I was about say somthing : where did I leaue ?

Both your Maiesties Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs , Put your dread pleasures , more into Command Then to Entreatie

Queene .
Amen .
Haue I , my Lord ?
Assure you , my good Liege , I hold my dutie , as I hold my Soule , Both to my God , one to my gracious King : And I do thinke , or else this braine of mine Hunts not the traile of Policie , so sure As I haue vs ' d to do : that I haue found The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie

Came this from Hamlet to her
Doubt thou , the Starres are fire , Doubt , that the Sunne doth moue : Doubt Truth to be a Lier , But neuer Doubt , I loue .
This in Obedience hath my daughter shew ' d me : And more aboue hath his soliciting , As they fell out by Time , by Meanes , and Place , All giuen to mine eare
King .
But how hath she receiu ' d his Loue ?
When I had seene this hot loue on the wing , As I perceiued it , I must tell you that Before my Daughter told me what might you Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere , think , If I had playd the Deske or Table - booke , Or giuen my heart a winking , mute and dumbe , Or look ' d vpon this Loue , with idle sight , What might you thinke ?
Pol .
Not that I know
Pol .
We will try it .
Well , God - a - mercy
I sir , to be honest as this world goes , is to bee one man pick ' d out of two thousand

What do you read my Lord ?
Though this be madnesse , Yet there is Method in ' t : will you walke Out of the ayre my Lord ?
A happinesse , That often Madnesse hits on , Which Reason and Sanitie could not So prosperously be deliuer ' d of .

Ham .
I will not sort you with the rest of my seruants : for to speake to you like an honest man : I am most dreadfully attended ; but in the beaten way of friendship , What make you at Elsonower ?
My Lord , there was no such stuffe in my thoughts
He that playes the King shall be welcome ; his Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee : the aduenturous Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target : the Louer shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace : the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled a ' th ' sere : and the Lady shall say her minde freely ; or the blanke Verse shall halt for ' t : what Players are they ?
Ham .
What are they Children ?
Faith there ha ' s bene much to do on both sides : and the Nation holds it no sinne , to tarre them to Controuersie .

Out , out , thou Strumpet - Fortune , all you Gods , In generall Synod take away her power : Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele , And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen , As low as to the Fiends
Pol .
That ' s good : Inobled Queene is good
Run bare - foot vp and downe , Threatning the flame With Bisson Rheume : A clout about that head , Where late the Diadem stood , and for a Robe About her lanke and all ore - teamed Loines , A blanket in th ' Alarum of feare caught vp .
Pol .
Exit Polon .
Ham .
Follow that Lord , and looke you mock him not .
Exeunt .
Ham .
He would drowne the Stage with teares , And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech : Make mad the guilty , and apale the free , Confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed , The very faculty of Eyes and Eares .
A Scullion ?
Ile haue these Players , Play something like the murder of my Father , Before mine Vnkle .
Ile haue grounds More Relatiue then this : The Play ' s the thing , Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King .
And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this Confusion : Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy
Rosin .
Did he receiue you well ?
' Tis most true : And he beseech ' d me to intreate your Maiesties To heare , and see the matter
Exeunt .
King .
That thus he suffers for
Gracious so please ye We will bestow our selues : Reade on this booke , That shew of such an exercise may colour Your lonelinesse .

Ophe .
No , no , I neuer gaue you ought
Ophe .
There my Lord
This was sometime a Paradox , but now the time giues it proofe .
I did loue you once
Indeed my Lord , you made me beleeue so
Ophe .
I am very prowd , reuengefull , Ambitious , with more offences at my becke , then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination , to giue them shape , or time to acte them in .
We are arrant Knaues all , beleeue none of vs . Goe thy wayes to a Nunnery .
Farewell
If thou doest Marry , Ile giue thee this Plague for thy Dowrie .
Be thou as chast as Ice , as pure as Snow , thou shalt not escape Calumny .

It shall be so : Madnesse in great Ones , must not vnwatch ' d go .
Enter Hamlet , and two or three of the Players .
Ham .
Be not too tame neyther : but let your owne Discretion be your Tutor .
For there be of them , that will themselues laugh , to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh too , though in the meane time , some necessary Question of the Play be then to be considered : that ' s Villanous , & shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses it .
Enter Polonius , Rosincrance , and Guildensterne .
Pol .
Hora .
Heere sweet Lord , at your Seruice
O my deere Lord
Ham .
Dost thou heare , Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse , And could of men distinguish , her election Hath seal ' d thee for her selfe .
For thou hast bene As one in suffering all , that suffers nothing .
Giue me that man , That is not Passions Slaue , and I will weare him In my hearts Core .
King .
And what did you enact ?
Pol .
Ham .
Ha .
Pol .
Oh ho , do you marke that ?
Oh God , your onely Iigge - maker : what should a man do , but be merrie .
Nay , ' tis twice two moneths , my Lord
Then there ' s hope , a great mans Memorie , may out - liue his life halfe a yeare : But byrlady he must builde Churches then : or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the Hoby - horsse , whose Epitaph is , For o , For o , the Hoby - horse is forgot .
The dead body is carried away : The Poysoner Wooes the Queene with Gifts , she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile , but in the end , accepts his loue .
Marry this is Miching Malicho , that meanes Mischeefe
We shall know by these Fellowes : the Players cannot keepe counsell , they ' l tell all
Is this a Prologue , or the Poesie of a Ring ?
As Womans loue .
Wormwood , Wormwood
Think what now you speak : But what we do determine , oft we breake : Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie , Of violent Birth , but poore validitie : Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree , But fall vnshaken , when they mellow bee .
This world is not for aye , nor ' tis not strange That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change .
But orderly to end , where I begun , Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run , That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne , Our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our owne .

Enter Polonius .
Ile warrant shee ' l tax him home , And as you said , and wisely was it said , ' Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother , Since Nature makes them partiall , should o ' re - heare The speech of vantage .

Alas , how is ' t with you ?
On him , on him : look you how pale he glares , His forme and cause conioyn ' d , preaching to stones , Would make them capeable .
Forgiue me this my Vertue , For in the fatnesse of this pursie times , Vertue it selfe , of Vice must pardon begge , Yea courb , and woe , for leaue to do him good
Good night , but go not to mine Vnkles bed , Assume a Vertue , if you haue it not , refraine to night , And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse To the next abstinence .
Ham .
' Twere good you let him know , For who that ' s but a Queene , faire , sober , wise , Would from a Paddocke , from a Bat , a Gibbe , Such deere concernings hide , Who would do so , No in despight of Sense and Secrecie , Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top : Let the Birds flye , and like the famous Ape To try Conclusions in the Basket , creepe And breake your owne necke downe
Qu .
Come sir , to draw toward an end with you .
These profound heaues You must translate ; Tis fit we vnderstand them .
Qu .
Alas , how shall this bloody deede be answered ?
But so much was our loue , We would not vnderstand what was most fit , But like the Owner of a foule disease , To keepe it from divulging , let ' s it feede Euen on the pith of life .
Who cals on Hamlet ?
Oh heere they come .
That I can keepe your counsell , and not mine owne .

Oh heate drie vp my Braines , teares seuen times salt , Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye .

So you shall : And where th ' offence is , let the great Axe fall .
Let them come in , I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted , if not from Lord Hamlet .
Enter Saylor .
There ' s a Letter for you Sir : It comes from th ' Ambassadours that was bound for England , if your name be Horatio , as I am let to know it is .
Finding our selues too slow of Saile , we put on a compelled Valour .
It well appeares .
But tell me , Why you proceeded not against these feates , So crimefull , and so Capitall in Nature , As by your Safety , Wisedome , all things else , You mainly were stirr ' d vp ?
O for two speciall Reasons , Which may to you ( perhaps ) seeme much vnsinnowed , And yet to me they are strong .
The other Motiue , Why to a publike count I might not go , Is the great loue the generall gender beare him , Who dipping all his Faults in their affection , Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone , Conuert his Gyues to Graces .
Laer .
Breake not your sleepes for that , You must not thinke That we are made of stuffe , so flat , and dull , That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger , And thinke it pastime .

Alas then , is she drown ' d ?
Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia , And therefore I forbid my teares : but yet It is our tricke , Nature her custome holds , Let shame say what it will ; when these are gone The woman will be out : Adue my Lord , I haue a speech of fire , that faine would blaze , But that this folly doubts it .
Why ' tis found so
It is an Act to doe and to performe ; argall she drown ' d her selfe wittingly

Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o ' this fashion i ' th ' earth ?
Hor .
E ' ene so

E ' ene so , my Lord
Ham .
Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander , till he find it stopping a bunghole
Alexander died : Alexander was buried : Alexander returneth into dust ; the dust is earth ; of earth we make Lome , and why of that Lome ( whereto he was conuerted ) might they not stopp a Beere - barrell ?
This doth betoken , The Coarse they follow , did with disperate hand , Fore do it owne life ; ' twas some Estate .

Come show me what thou ' lt doe .

So much for this Sir ; now let me see the other , You doe remember all the Circumstance
Remember it my Lord ?
Ham .
Sir , in my heart there was a kinde of fighting , That would not let me sleepe ; me thought I lay Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes , rashly , ( And praise be rashnesse for it ) let vs know , Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well , When our deare plots do paule , and that should teach vs , There ' s a Diuinity that shapes our ends , Rough - hew them how we will
Here ' s the Commission , read it at more leysure : But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed ?
Being thus benetted round with Villaines , Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines , They had begun the Play .
I , good my Lord
Does it not , thinkst thee , stand me now vpon He that hath kil ' d my King , and whor ' d my Mother , Popt in betweene th ' election and my hopes , Throwne out his Angle for my proper life , And with such coozenage ; is ' t not perfect conscience , To quit him with this arme ?
Ham .
Exceedingly , my Lord , it is very soultry , as ' twere I cannot tell how : but my Lord , his Maiesty bad me signifie to you , that he ha ' s laid a great wager on your head : Sir , this is the matter
What ' s his weapon ?
What call you the Carriages ?

I doe not thinke so , since he went into France , I haue beene in continuall practice ; I shall winne at the oddes : but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about my heart : but it is no matter

} As I Ponder ' d in Silence
it said , Know ' st thou not there is hut one theme for ever - enduring bards ?
eidolons !
Lo , I or you , Or woman , man , or state , known or unknown , We seeming solid wealth , strength , beauty build , But really build eidolons .
The old , old urge , Based on the ancient pinnacles , lo , newer , higher pinnacles , From science and the modern still impell ' d , The old , old urge , eidolons .
Exalte , rapt , ecstatic , The visible but their womb of birth , Of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape , The mighty earth - eidolon .
The prophet and the bard , Shall yet maintain themselves , in higher stages yet , Shall mediate to the Modern , to Democracy , interpret yet to them , God and eidolons .
And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life ?
} Me Imperturbe
} The Ship Starting
The pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately -- below emulous waves press forward , They surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam .
Not to - day is to justify me and answer what I am for , But you , a new brood , native , athletic , continental , greater than before known , Arouse !
Stranger , if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me , why should you not speak to me ?
Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I , Therefore for thee the following chants .
This then is life , Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions .
How curious !
how real !
Foremost !
Here lands female and male , Here the heir - ship and heiress - ship of the world , here the flame of materials , Here spirituality the translatress , the openly - avow ' d , The ever - tending , the finale of visible forms , The satisfier , after due long - waiting now advancing , Yes here comes my mistress the soul .
6 The soul , Forever and forever -- longer than soil is brown and solid -- longer than water ebbs and flows .
I will acknowledge contemporary lands , I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously every city large and small , And employments !
7 I am the credulous man of qualities , ages , races , I advance from the people in their own spirit , Here is what sings unrestricted faith .
Your ambition or business whatever it may be ?
such swiftly subside , burnt up for religion ' s sake , For not all matter is fuel to heat , impalpable flame , the essential life of the earth , Any more than such are to religion .
For you to share with me two greatnesses , and a third one rising inclusive and more resplendent , The greatness of Love and Democracy , and the greatness of Religion .
Melange mine own , the unseen and the seen , Mysterious ocean where the streams empty , Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me , Living beings , identities now doubtless near us in the air that we know not of , Contact daily and hourly that will not release me , These selecting , these in hints demanded of me .
O divine average !
I have seen the he - bird also , I have paus ' d to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and joyfully singing .
for the brood beyond us and of us , For those who belong here and those to come , I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth .
I will make the true poem of riches , To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward and is not dropt by death ; I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all , and I will be the bard of personality , And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other , And sexual organs and acts !
Not the types set up by the printer return their impression , the meaning , the main concern , Any more than a man ' s substance and life or a woman ' s substance and life return in the body and the soul , Indifferently before death and after death .
Interlink ' d , food - yielding lands !
Land of boatmen and sailors !
The great women ' s land !
O I at any rate include you all with perfect love !
I cannot be discharged from you !
O death !
The red aborigines , Leaving natural breaths , sounds of rain and winds , calls as of birds and animals in the woods , syllabled to us for names , Okonee , Koosa , Ottawa , Monongahela , Sauk , Natchez , Chattahoochee , Kaqueta , Oronoco , Wabash , Miami , Saginaw , Chippewa , Oshkosh , Walla - Walla , Leaving such to the States they melt , they depart , charging the water and the land with names .
17 Expanding and swift , henceforth , Elements , breeds , adjustments , turbulent , quick and audacious , A world primal again , vistas of glory incessant and branching , A new race dominating previous ones and grander far , with new contests , New politics , new literatures and religions , new inventions and arts .
[ BOOK III ]
Clear and sweet is my soul , and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul .
Welcome is every organ and attribute of me , and of any man hearty and clean , Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile , and none shall be less familiar than the rest .
4 Trippers and askers surround me , People I meet , the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in , or the nation , The latest dates , discoveries , inventions , societies , authors old and new , My dinner , dress , associates , looks , compliments , dues , The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love , The sickness of one of my folks or of myself , or ill - doing or loss or lack of money , or depressions or exaltations , Battles , the horrors of fratricidal war , the fever of doubtful news , the fitful events ; These come to me days and nights and go from me again , But they are not the Me myself .
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition , out of hopeful green stuff woven .
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers , Darker than the colorless beards of old men , Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths .
And what do you think has become of the women and children ?
They are alive and well somewhere , The smallest sprout shows there is really no death , And if ever there was it led forward life , and does not wait at the end to arrest it , And ceas ' d the moment life appear ' d .
All goes onward and outward , nothing collapses , And to die is different from what any one supposed , and luckier .
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her .
Where are you off to , lady ?
In me the caresser of life wherever moving , backward as well as forward sluing , To niches aside and junior bending , not a person or object missing , Absorbing all to myself and for this song .
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life .
I believe in those wing ' d purposes , And acknowledge red , yellow , white , playing within me , And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional , And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else , And the in the woods never studied the gamut , yet trills pretty well to me , And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me .
17 These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands , they are not original with me , If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing , or next to nothing , If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing , If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing .
Have you heard that it was good to gain the day ?
Vivas to those who have fail ' d !
Do you guess I have some intricate purpose ?
Do you take it I would astonish ?
Does the daylight astonish ?
does the early redstart twittering through the woods ?
This hour I tell things in confidence , I might not tell everybody , but I will tell you .
20 Who goes there ?
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees !
O unspeakable passionate love .
I am he attesting sympathy , ( Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them ?)
Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy ?
This minute that comes to me over the past decillions , There is no better than it and now .
A word of the faith that never balks , Here or henceforward it is all the same to me , I accept Time absolutely .
Through me forbidden voices , Voices of sexes and lusts , voices veil ' d and I remove the veil , Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur ' d .
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you !
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you !
timorous pond - snipe !
The earth by the sky staid with , the daily close of their junction , The heav ' d challenge from the east that moment over my head , The mocking taunt , See then whether you shall be master !
Come now I will not be tantalized , you conceive too much of articulation , Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded ?
Waiting in gloom , protected by frost , The dirt receding before my prophetical screams , I underlying causes to balance them at last , My knowledge my live parts , it keeping tally with the meaning of all things , Happiness , ( which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day .)
( Round and round we go , all of us , and ever come back thither ,) If nothing lay more develop ' d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough .
I merely stir , press , feel with my fingers , and am happy , To touch my person to some one else ' s is about as much as I can stand .
The sentries desert every other part of me , They have left me helpless to a red marauder , They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me .
Logic and sermons never convince , The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul .
In vain the speeding or shyness , In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach , In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder ' d bones , In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes , In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low , In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky , In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs , In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods , In vain the razor - bill ' d auk sails far north to Labrador , I follow quickly , I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff .
Myself moving forward then and now and forever , Gathering and showing more always and with velocity , Infinite and omnigenous , and the like of these among them , Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers , Picking out here one that I love , and now go with him on brotherly terms .
A gigantic beauty of a stallion , fresh and responsive to my caresses , Head high in the forehead , wide between the ears , Limbs glossy and supple , tail dusting the ground , Eyes full of sparkling wickedness , ears finely cut , flexibly moving .
33 Space and Time !
My ties and ballasts leave me , my elbows rest in sea - gaps , I skirt sierras , my palms cover continents , I am afoot with my vision .
I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul , My course runs below the soundings of plummets .
The disdain and calmness of martyrs , The mother of old , condemn ' d for a witch , burnt with dry wood , her children gazing on , The hounded slave that flags in the race , leans by the fence , blowing , cover ' d with sweat , The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck , the murderous buckshot and the bullets , All these I feel or am .
I am an old artillerist , I tell of my fort ' s bombardment , I am there again .
Again the long roll of the drummers , Again the attacking cannon , mortars , Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive .
The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels , They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust .
If our colors are struck and the fighting done ?
The tops alone second the fire of this little battery , especially the main - top , They hold out bravely during the whole of the action .
36 Stretch ' d and still lies the midnight , Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness , Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking , preparations to pass to the one we have conquer ' d , The captain on the quarter - deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet , Near by the corpse of the child that serv ' d in the cabin , The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl ' d whiskers , The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below , The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty , Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves , dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars , Cut of cordage , dangle of rigging , slight shock of the soothe of waves , Black and impassive guns , litter of powder - parcels , strong scent , A few large stars overhead , silent and mournful shining , Delicate sniffs of sea - breeze , smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore , death - messages given in charge to survivors , The hiss of the surgeon ' s knife , the gnawing teeth of his saw , Wheeze , cluck , swash of falling blood , short wild scream , and long , dull , tapering groan , These so , these irretrievable .
look to your arms !
I am possess ' d !
enough !
enough !
Stand back !
39 The friendly and flowing savage , who is he ?
Is he waiting for civilization , or past it and mastering it ?
prairie - life , bush - life ?
On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes .
Magnifying and applying come I , Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters , Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah , Lithographing Kronos , Zeus his son , and Hercules his grandson , Buying drafts of Osiris , Isis , Belus , Brahma , Buddha , In my portfolio placing Manito loose , Allah on a leaf , the crucifix engraved , With Odin and the hideous - faced Mexitli and every idol and image , Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more , Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days , ( They bore mites as for unfledg ' d birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves ,) Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself , bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see , Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house , Putting higher claims for him there with his roll ' d - up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel , Not objecting to special revelations , considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation , Lads ahold of fire - engines and hook - and - ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars , Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction , Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr ' d laths , their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames ; By the mechanic ' s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born , Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg ' d out at their waists , The snag - tooth ' d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come , Selling all he possesses , traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery ; What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me , and not filling the square rod then , The bull and the bug never worshipp ' d half enough , Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream ' d , The supernatural of no account , myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes , The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best , and be as prodigious ; By my life - lumps !
Ever the hard unsunk ground , Ever the eaters and drinkers , ever the upward and downward sun , ever the air and the ceaseless tides , Ever myself and my neighbors , refreshing , wicked , real , Ever the old inexplicable query , ever that thorn ' d thumb , that breath of itches and thirsts , Ever the vexer ' s hoot !
Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking , To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning , Tickets buying , taking , selling , but in to the feast never once going , Many sweating , ploughing , thrashing , and then the chaff for payment receiving , A few idly owning , and they the wheat continually claiming .
This is the city and I am one of the citizens , Whatever interests the rest interests me , politics , wars , markets , newspapers , schools , The mayor and councils , banks , tariffs , steamships , factories , stocks , stores , real estate and personal estate .
Sermons , creeds , theology -- but the fathomless human brain , And what is reason ?
and what is life ?
One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like man leaving charges before a journey .
How the flukes splash !
How they contort rapid as lightning , with spasms and spouts of blood !
Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers , I take my place among you as much as among any , The past is the push of you , me , all , precisely the same , And what is yet untried and afterward is for you , me , all , precisely the same .
I do not know what is untried and afterward , But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient , and cannot fail .
The clock indicates the moment -- but what does eternity indicate ?
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers , There are trillions ahead , and trillions ahead of them .
Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you , my brother , my sister ?
O manhood , balanced , florid and full .
Every condition promulges not only itself , it promulges what grows after and out of itself , And the dark hush promulges as much as any .
You are also asking me questions and I hear you , I answer that I cannot answer , you must find out for yourself .
The young mechanic is closest to me , he knows me well , The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day , The farm - boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice , In vessels that sail my words sail , I go with fishermen and seamen and love them .
And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure , but that does not offend me , I smell the white roses sweet - scented and growing , I reach to the leafy lips , I reach to the polish ' d breasts of melons .
Wrench ' d and sweaty -- calm and cool then my body becomes , I sleep -- I sleep long .
I do not know it -- it is without name -- it is a word unsaid , It is not in any dictionary , utterance , symbol .
what have you to confide to me ?
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love , If you want me again look for me under your boot - soles .
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged , Missing me one place search another , I stop somewhere waiting for you .
O it , more than all else , you delighting !)
What is all else to us ?
There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them , and in the contact and odor of them , that pleases the soul well , All things please the soul , but these please the soul well .
The female contains all qualities and tempers them , She is in her place and moves with perfect balance , She is all things duly veil ' d , she is both passive and active , She is to conceive daughters as well as sons , and sons as well as daughters .
6 The male is not less the soul nor more , he too is in his place , He too is all qualities , he is action and power , The flush of the known universe is in him , Scorn becomes him well , and appetite and defiance become him well , The wildest largest passions , bliss that is utmost , sorrow that is utmost become him well , pride is for him , The full - spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul , Knowledge becomes him , he likes it always , he brings every thing to the test of himself , Whatever the survey , whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here , ( Where else does he strike soundings except here ?)
Is it one of the dull - faced immigrants just landed on the wharf ?
9 O my body !
} One Hour to Madness and Joy
What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean ?)
O the puzzle , the thrice - tied knot , the deep and dark pool , all untied and illumin ' d !
To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom !
Now we have met , we have look ' d , we are safe , Return in peace to the ocean my love , I too am part of that ocean my love , we are not so much separated , Behold the great rondure , the cohesion of all , how perfect !
} Ages and Ages Returning at Intervals
We two , how long we were fool ' d , Now transmuted , we swiftly escape as Nature escapes , We are Nature , long have we been absent , but now we return , We become plants , trunks , foliage , roots , bark , We are bedded in the ground , we are rocks , We are oaks , we grow in the openings side by side , We browse , we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any , We are two fishes swimming in the sea together , We are what locust blossoms are , we drop scent around lanes mornings and evenings , We are also the coarse smut of beasts , vegetables , minerals , We are two predatory hawks , we soar above and look down , We are two resplendent suns , we it is who balance ourselves orbic and stellar , we are as two comets , We prowl fang ' d and four - footed in the woods , we spring on prey , We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead , We are seas mingling , we are two of those cheerful waves rolling over each other and interwetting each other , We are what the atmosphere is , transparent , receptive , pervious , impervious , We are snow , rain , cold , darkness , we are each product and influence of the globe , We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again , we two , We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy .
Why can you not continue ?
does not all matter , aching , attract all matter ?
Do not fold yourself so in your pink - tinged roots timid leaves !
For you , for you I am trilling these songs .
And who but I should be the poet of comrades ?)
Need I that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs .
( So to the students the old professor , At the close of his crowded course .)
Having studied the new and antique , the Greek and Germanic systems , Kant having studied and stated , Fichte and Schelling and Hegel , Stated the lore of Plato , and Socrates greater than Plato , And greater than Socrates sought and stated , Christ divine having studied long , I see reminiscent to - day those Greek and Germanic systems , See the philosophies all , Christian churches and tenets see , Yet underneath Socrates clearly see , and underneath Christ the divine I see , The dear love of man for his comrade , the attraction of friend to friend , Of the well - married husband and wife , of children and parents , Of city for city and land for land .
Are you the new person drawn toward me ?
Trickle drops !
trickle , slow drops , Candid from me falling , drip , bleeding drops , From wounds made to free you whence you were prison ' d , From my face , from my forehead and lips , From my breast , from within where I was conceal ' d , press forth red drops , confession drops , Stain every page , stain every song I sing , every word I say , bloody drops , Let them know your scarlet heat , let them glisten , Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet , Glow upon all I have written or shall write , bleeding drops , Let it all be seen in your light , blushing drops .
you do not know how longingly I look upon you , You must be he I was seeking , or she I was seeking , ( it comes to me as of a dream ,) I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you , All is recall ' d as we flit by each other , fluid , affectionate , chaste , matured , You grew up with me , were a boy with me or a girl with me , I ate with you and slept with you , your body has become not yours only nor left my body mine only , You give me the pleasure of your eyes , face , flesh , as we pass , you take of my beard , breast , hands , in return , I am not to speak to you , I am to think of you when I sit alone or wake at night alone , I am to wait , I do not doubt I am to meet you again , I am to see to it that I do not lose you .
} We Two Boys Together Clinging
We two boys together clinging , One the other never leaving , Up and down the roads going , North and South excursions making , Power enjoying , elbows stretching , fingers clutching , Arm ' d and fearless , eating , drinking , sleeping , loving .
No law less than ourselves owning , sailing , soldiering , thieving , threatening , Misers , menials , priests alarming , air breathing , water drinking , on the turf or the sea - beach dancing , Cities wrenching , ease scorning , statutes mocking , feebleness chasing , Fulfilling our foray .
A promise to California , Or inland to the great pastoral Plains , and on to Puget sound and Oregon ; Sojourning east a while longer , soon I travel toward you , to remain , to teach robust American love , For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you , inland , and along the Western sea ; For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea , and I will also .
No labor - saving machine , Nor discovery have I made , Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found hospital or library , Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for America , Nor literary success nor intellect ; nor book for the book - shelf , But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave , For comrades and lovers .
You twain !
The battle - ship , perfect - model ' d , majestic , that I saw pass the offing to - day under full sail ?
or the splendor of the night that envelops me ?
Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me ?
( Be not too certain but I am now with you .)
what persons and cities are here ?
2 Within me latitude widens , longitude lengthens , Asia , Africa , Europe , are to the east -- America is provided for in the west , Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator , Curiously north and south turn the axis - ends , Within me is the longest day , the sun wheels in slanting rings , it does not set for months , Stretch ' d in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the horizon and sinks again , Within me zones , seas , cataracts , forests , volcanoes , groups , Malaysia , Polynesia , and the great West Indian islands .
I see plenteous waters , I see mountain peaks , I see the sierras of Andes where they range , I see plainly the Himalayas , Chian Shahs , Altays , Ghauts , I see the giant pinnacles of Elbruz , Kazbek , Bazardjusi , I see the Styrian Alps , and the Karnac Alps , I see the Pyrenees , Balks , Carpathians , and to the north the Dofrafields , and off at sea mount Hecla , I see Vesuvius and Etna , the mountains of the Moon , and the Red mountains of Madagascar , I see the Lybian , Arabian , and Asiatic deserts , I see huge dreadful Arctic and Antarctic icebergs , I see the superior oceans and the inferior ones , the Atlantic and Pacific , the sea of Mexico , the Brazilian sea , and the sea of Peru , The waters of Hindustan , the China sea , and the gulf of Guinea , The Japan waters , the beautiful bay of Nagasaki land - lock ' d in its mountains , The spread of the Baltic , Caspian , Bothnia , the British shores , and the bay of Biscay , The clear - sunn ' d Mediterranean , and from one to another of its islands , The White sea , and the sea around Greenland .
6 I see the site of the old empire of Assyria , and that of Persia , and that of India , I see the falling of the Ganges over the high rim of Saukara .
I see the places of the sagas , I see pine - trees and fir - trees torn by northern blasts , I see granite bowlders and cliffs , I see green meadows and lakes , I see the burial - cairns of Scandinavian warriors , I see them raised high with stones by the marge of restless oceans , that the dead men ' s spirits when they wearied of their quiet graves might rise up through the mounds and gaze on the tossing billows , and be refresh ' d by storms , immensity , liberty , action .
You Norwegian !
You Spaniard of Spain !
you liberty - lover of the Netherlands !
Bulgarian !
you Greek !
You Jew journeying in your old age through every risk to stand once on Syrian ground !
All you on the numberless islands of the archipelagoes of the sea !
Each of us inevitable , Each of us limitless -- each of us with his or her right upon the earth , Each of us allow ' d the eternal purports of the earth , Each of us here as divinely as any is here .
you woolly - hair ' d hordes !
You human forms with the fathomless ever - impressive countenances of brutes !
you Feejeeman !
You vapors , I think I have risen with you , moved away to distant continents , and fallen down there , for reasons , I think I have blown with you you winds ; You waters I have finger ' d every shore with you , I have run through what any river or strait of the globe has run through , I have taken my stand on the bases of peninsulas and on the high embedded rocks , to cry thence :
[ BOOK VII ]
3 You air that serves me with breath to speak !
You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides !
You flagg ' d walks of the cities !
you window - pierc ' d facades !
O highway I travel , do you say to me Do not leave me ?
Do you say I am already prepared , I am well - beaten and undenied , adhere to me ?
O public road , I say back I am not afraid to leave you , yet I love you , You express me better than I can express myself , You shall be more to me than my poem .
I think heroic deeds were all conceiv ' d in the open air , and all free poems also , I think I could stop here myself and do miracles , I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like , and whoever beholds me shall like me , I think whoever I see must be happy .
5 From this hour I ordain myself loos ' d of limits and imaginary lines , Going where I list , my own master total and absolute , Listening to others , considering well what they say , Pausing , searching , receiving , contemplating , Gently , but with undeniable will , divesting myself of the holds that would hold me .
I inhale great draughts of space , The east and the west are mine , and the north and the south are mine .
Now I re - examine philosophies and religions , They may prove well in lecture - rooms , yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents .
7 Here is the efflux of the soul , The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower ' d gates , ever provoking questions , These yearnings why are they ?
( I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as I pass ;) What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers ?
whoever you are come travel with me !
10 Allons !
to that which is endless as it was beginningless , To undergo much , tramps of days , rests of nights , To merge all in the travel they tend to , and the days and nights they tend to , Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys , To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it , To conceive no time , however distant , but what you may reach it and pass it , To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you , however long but it stretches and waits for you , To see no being , not God ' s or any , but you also go thither , To see no possession but you may possess it , enjoying all without labor or purchase , abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one particle of it , To take the best of the farmer ' s farm and the rich man ' s elegant villa , and the chaste blessings of the well - married couple , and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens , To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through , To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go , To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter them , to gather the love out of their hearts , To take your lovers on the road with you , for all that you leave them behind you , To know the universe itself as a road , as many roads , as roads for traveling souls .
All parts away for the progress of souls , All religion , all solid things , arts , governments -- all that was or is apparent upon this globe or any globe , falls into niches and corners before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe .

Let the school stand !
Shall we stick by each other as long as we live ?
} Crossing Brooklyn Ferry
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes , how curious you are to me !
2 The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day , The simple , compact , well - join ' d scheme , myself disintegrated , every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme , The similitudes of the past and those of the future , The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings , on the walk in the street and the passage over the river , The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away , The others that are to follow me , the ties between me and them , The certainty of others , the life , love , sight , hearing of others .
Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore , Others will watch the run of the flood - tide , Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west , and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east , Others will see the islands large and small ; Fifty years hence , others will see them as they cross , the sun half an hour high , A hundred years hence , or ever so many hundred years hence , others will see them , Will enjoy the sunset , the pouring - in of the flood - tide , the falling - back to the sea of the ebb - tide .
I too many and many a time cross ' d the river of old , Watched the Twelfth - month sea - gulls , saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings , oscillating their bodies , Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow , Saw the slow - wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south , Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water , Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams , Look ' d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water , Look ' d on the haze on the hills southward and south - westward , Look ' d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet , Look ' d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving , Saw their approach , saw aboard those that were near me , Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops , saw the ships at anchor , The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars , The round masts , the swinging motion of the hulls , the slender serpentine pennants , The large and small steamers in motion , the pilots in their pilothouses , The white wake left by the passage , the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels , The flags of all nations , the falling of them at sunset , The scallop - edged waves in the twilight , the ladled cups , the frolic - some crests and glistening , The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer , the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks , On the river the shadowy group , the big steam - tug closely flank ' d on each side by the barges , the hay - boat , the belated lighter , On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night , Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses , and down into the clefts of streets .
Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil , I am he who knew what it was to be evil , I too knitted the old knot of contrariety , Blabb ' d , blush ' d , resented , lied , stole , grudg ' d , Had guile , anger , lust , hot wishes I dared not speak , Was wayward , vain , greedy , shallow , sly , cowardly , malignant , The wolf , the snake , the hog , not wanting in me .
Who was to know what should come home to me ?
We understand then do we not ?
stand up , beautiful hills of Brooklyn !
throw out questions and answers !
Suspend here and everywhere , eternal float of solution !
Play the old role , the role that is great or small according as one makes it !
1 Now list to my morning ' s romanza , I tell the signs of the Answerer , To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine before me .
2 The indications and tally of time , Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs , Time , always without break , indicates itself in parts , What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company of singers , and their words , The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark , but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark , The maker of poems settles justice , reality , immortality , His insight and power encircle things and the human race , He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race .
[ BOOK X ]
O for the dropping of raindrops in a song !
The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure .
Something unproved !
something in a trance !
What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me ?
O the orator ' s joys !
O to realize space !
Joy of the plenteous dinner , strong carouse and drinking ?
Joys of the free and lonesome heart , the tender , gloomy heart ?
Prophetic joys of better , loftier love ' s ideals , the divine wife , the sweet , eternal , perfect comrade ?
The beautiful touch of Death , soothing and benumbing a few moments , for reasons , Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn ' d , or render ' d to powder , or buried , My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres , My voided body nothing more to me , returning to the purifications , further offices , eternal uses of the earth .
the something which obeys none of the rest , It is offensive , never defensive -- yet how magnetic it draws .
or a prepared constitution ?
or any chef - d ' oeuvres of engineering , forts , armaments ?
How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a man ' s or woman ' s look !
Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky ?)
The solid forest gives fluid utterances , They tumble forth , they rise and form , Hut , tent , landing , survey , Flail , plough , pick , crowbar , spade , Shingle , rail , prop , wainscot , lamb , lath , panel , gable , Citadel , ceiling , saloon , academy , organ , exhibition - house , library , Cornice , trellis , pilaster , balcony , window , turret , porch , Hoe , rake , pitchfork , pencil , wagon , staff , saw , jack - plane , mallet , wedge , rounce , Chair , tub , hoop , table , wicket , vane , sash , floor , Work - box , chest , string ' d instrument , boat , frame , and what not , Capitols of States , and capitol of the nation of States , Long stately rows in avenues , hospitals for orphans or for the poor or sick , Manhattan steamboats and clippers taking the measure of all seas .
The shapes arise !
Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances , The door passing the dissever ' d friend flush ' d and in haste , The door that admits good news and bad news , The door whence the son left home confident and puff ' d up , The door he enter ' d again from a long and scandalous absence , diseas ' d , broken down , without innocence , without means .
11 Her shape arises , She less guarded than ever , yet more guarded than ever , The gross and soil ' d she moves among do not make her gross and soil ' d , She knows the thoughts as she passes , nothing is conceal ' d from her , She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor , She is the best belov ' d , it is without exception , she has no reason to fear and she does not fear , Oaths , quarrels , hiccupp ' d songs , smutty expressions , are idle to her as she passes , She is silent , she is possess ' d of herself , they do not offend her , She receives them as the laws of Nature receive them , she is strong , She too is a law of Nature -- there is no law stronger than she is .
[ BOOK XIII ]
Yes , if you will allow me to say so , I , my friends , if you do not , can plainly see her , The same undying soul of earth ' s , activity ' s , beauty ' s , heroism ' s expression , Out from her evolutions hither come , ended the strata of her former themes , Hidden and cover ' d by to - day ' s , foundation of to - day ' s , Ended , deceas ' d through time , her voice by Castaly ' s fountain , Silent the broken - lipp ' d Sphynx in Egypt , silent all those century - baffling tombs , Ended for aye the epics of Asia ' s , Europe ' s helmeted warriors , ended the primitive call of the muses , Calliope ' s call forever closed , Clio , Melpomene , Thalia dead , Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana , ended the quest of the holy Graal , Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind , extinct , The Crusaders ' streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with the sunrise , Amadis , Tancred , utterly gone , Charlemagne , Roland , Oliver gone , Palmerin , ogre , departed , vanish ' d the turrets that Usk from its waters reflected , Arthur vanish ' d with all his knights , Merlin and Lancelot and Galahad , all gone , dissolv ' d utterly like an exhalation ; Pass ' d !

Somewhere within their walls shall all that forwards perfect human life be started , Tried , taught , advanced , visibly exhibited .
Here shall you trace in flowing operation , In every state of practical , busy movement , the rills of civilization , Materials here under your eye shall change their shape as if by magic , The cotton shall be pick ' d almost in the very field , Shall be dried , clean ' d , ginn ' d , baled , spun into thread and cloth before you , You shall see hands at work at all the old processes and all the new ones , You shall see the various grains and how flour is made and then bread baked by the bakers , You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing on and on till they become bullion , You shall watch how the printer sets type , and learn what a composing - stick is , You shall mark in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders , shedding the printed leaves steady and fast , The photograph , model , watch , pin , nail , shall be created before you .
In large calm halls , a stately museum shall teach you the infinite lessons of minerals , In another , woods , plants , vegetation shall be illustrated -- in another animals , animal life and development .
away with war itself !
Hence from my shuddering sight to never more return that show of blacken ' d , mutilated corpses !
8 And thou America , Thy offspring towering e ' er so high , yet higher Thee above all towering , With Victory on thy left , and at thy right hand Law ; Thou Union holding all , fusing , absorbing , tolerating all , Thee , ever thee , I sing .
( and thou , ineffable guest and sister !)
Protectress absolute , thou !
While we rehearse our measureless wealth , it is for thee , dear Mother , We own it all and several to - day indissoluble in thee ; Think not our chant , our show , merely for products gross or lucre -- it is for thee , the soul in thee , electric , spiritual !
Our freedom all in thee !
[ BOOK XIV ]
Farewell my brethren , Farewell O earth and sky , farewell ye neighboring waters , My time has ended , my term has come .
Murmuring out of its myriad leaves , Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high , Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs , out of its foot - thick bark , That chant of the seasons and time , chant not of the past only but the future .
Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers , We who have grandly fill ' d our time , With Nature ' s calm content , with tacit huge delight , We welcome what we wrought for through the past , And leave the field for them .
2 The flashing and golden pageant of California , The sudden and gorgeous drama , the sunny and ample lands , The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south , Lands bathed in sweeter , rarer , healthier air , valleys and mountain cliffs , The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow , the silent , cyclic chemistry , The slow and steady ages plodding , the unoccupied surface ripening , the rich ores forming beneath ; At last the New arriving , assuming , taking possession , A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere , Ships coming in from the whole round world , and going out to the whole world , To India and China and Australia and the thousand island paradises of the Pacific , Populous cities , the latest inventions , the steamers on the rivers , the railroads , with many a thrifty farm , with machinery , And wool and wheat and the grape , and diggings of yellow gold .
In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields I find the developments , And find the eternal meanings .
it is not you I call unseen , unheard , untouchable and untouching , It is not you I go argue pro and con about , and to settle whether you are alive or no , I own publicly who you are , if nobody else owns .
Grown , half - grown and babe , of this country and every country , in - doors and out - doors , one just as much as the other , I see , And all else behind or through them .
3 The sun and stars that float in the open air , The apple - shaped earth and we upon it , surely the drift of them is something grand , I do not know what it is except that it is grand , and that it is happiness , And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation or bon - mot or reconnoissance , And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us , and without luck must be a failure for us , And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency .
or for the profits of your store ?
Or to achieve yourself a position ?
Will we rate our cash and business high ?
We consider bibles and religions divine -- I do not say they are not divine , I say they have all grown out of you , and may grow out of you still , It is not they who give the life , it is you who give the life , Leaves are not more shed from the trees , or trees from the earth , than they are shed out of you .
4 The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are , The President is there in the White House for you , it is not you who are here for him , The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you , not you here for them , The Congress convenes every Twelfth - month for you , Laws , courts , the forming of States , the charters of cities , the going and coming of commerce and malls , are all for you .
List close my scholars dear , Doctrines , politics and civilization exurge from you , Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are tallied in you , The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records reach is in you this hour , and myths and tales the same , If you were not breathing and walking here , where would they all be ?
When the psalm sings instead of the singer ,
[ BOOK XVI ]
those curves , angles , dots ?
No , those are not the words , the substantial words are in the ground and sea , They are in the air , they are in you .
A healthy presence , a friendly or commanding gesture , are words , sayings , meanings , The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women , are sayings and meanings also .
Amelioration is one of the earth ' s words , The earth neither lags nor hastens , It has all attributes , growths , effects , latent in itself from the jump , It is not half beautiful only , defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show .
The earth does not argue , Is not pathetic , has no arrangements , Does not scream , haste , persuade , threaten , promise , Makes no discriminations , has no conceivable failures , Closes nothing , refuses nothing , shuts none out , Of all the powers , objects , states , it notifies , shuts none out .
Seen at hand or seen at a distance , Duly the twenty - four appear in public every day , Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion , Looking from no countenances of their own , but from the countenances of those who are with them , From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance , From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things , From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky , From our countenances , mine and yours , faithfully returning them , Every day in public appearing without fall , but never twice with the same companions .
motion and reflection are especially for you , The divine ship sails the divine sea for you .
I swear I see what is better than to tell the best , It is always to leave the best untold .
Out of the bulk , the morbid and the shallow , Out of the bad majority , the varied countless frauds of men and states , Electric , antiseptic yet , cleaving , suffusing all , Only the good is universal .
From imperfection ' s murkiest cloud , Darts always forth one ray of perfect light , One flash of heaven ' s glory .
Have the elder races halted ?
O pioneers !
O pioneers !
O pioneers !
These are of us , they are with us , All for primal needed work , while the followers there in embryo wait behind , We to - day ' s procession heading , we the route for travel clearing , Pioneers !
O pioneers !
to the head of the army !-- swift !
O pioneers !
Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centre - figure of all , From the head of the centre - figure spreading a nimbus of gold - color ' d light , But I paint myriads of heads , but paint no head without its nimbus of gold - color ' d light , From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it streams , effulgently flowing forever .
Here too the blaze , the grape - shot and the axe , in reserve , to fetch them out in case of need , Here too , though long represt , can never be destroy ' d , Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic , Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance .
Not to chisel ornaments , But to chisel with free stroke the heads and limbs of plenteous supreme Gods , that the States may realize them walking and talking .
What about these likes of myself that draw me so close by tender directions and indirections ?
( Remember you surging Manhattan ' s crowds as you pass ' d with your cortege of nobles ?
As I flit through you hastily , soon to fall and be gone , what is this chant , What am I myself but one of your meteors ?
Were the centuries steadily footing it that way , all the while unknown , for you , for reasons ?
[ BOOK XIX .
Once Paumanok , When the lilac - scent was in the air and Fifth - month grass was growing , Up this seashore in some briers , Two feather ' d guests from Alabama , two together , And their nest , and four light - green eggs spotted with brown , And every day the he - bird to and fro near at hand , And every day the she - bird crouch ' d on her nest , silent , with bright eyes , And every day I , a curious boy , never too close , never disturbing them , Cautiously peering , absorbing , translating .
He call ' d on his mate , He pour ' d forth the meanings which I of all men know .
O madly the sea pushes upon the land , With love , with love .
loud !
Low - hanging moon !
O moon do not keep her from me any longer .
Whichever way I turn , O I think you could give me my mate back again if you only would , For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look .
Solitary here , the night ' s carols !
Hither my love !
here !
O throbbing heart !
Demon or bird !
( said the boy ' s soul ,) Is it indeed toward your mate you sing ?
O you singer solitary , singing by yourself , projecting me , O solitary me listening , never more shall I cease perpetuating you , Never more shall I escape , never more the reverberations , Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me , Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there in the night , By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon , The messenger there arous ' d , the fire , the sweet hell within , The unknown want , the destiny of me .
O give me the clue !
I perceive I have not really understood any thing , not a single object , and that no man ever can , Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me , Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all .
tears !
Through fog on a sea - coast dolefully ringing , An ocean - bell -- O a warning bell , rock ' d by the waves .
} On the Beach at Night
Up through the darkness , While ravening clouds , the burial clouds , in black masses spreading , Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky , Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east , Ascends large and calm the lord - star Jupiter , And nigh at hand , only a very little above , Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades .
Then dearest child mournest thou only for jupiter ?
But do you reserve especially for yourself and for the soul of man one flag above all the rest , A spiritual woven signal for all nations , emblem of man elate above death , Token of all brave captains and all intrepid sailors and mates , And all that went down doing their duty , Reminiscent of them , twined from all intrepid captains young or old , A pennant universal , subtly waving all time , o ' er all brave sailors , All seas , all ships .

} A Boston Ballad [ 1854 ]
Way for the Federal foot and dragoons , ( and the apparitions copiously tumbling .)
To your graves -- back -- back to the hills old limpers !
I do not think you belong here anyhow .
And you , paid to defile the People -- you liars , mark !
Those corpses of young men , Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets , those hearts pierc ' d by the gray lead , Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter ' d vitality .
} Thoughts
} When I Heard the Learn ' d Astronomer
Only themselves understand themselves and the like of themselves , As souls only understand souls .
O Life !
O life !
For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman , For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of the universe .
Skirting the river road , ( my forenoon walk , my rest ,) Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound , the dalliance of the eagles , The rushing amorous contact high in space together , The clinching interlocking claws , a living , fierce , gyrating wheel , Four beating wings , two beaks , a swirling mass tight grappling , In tumbling turning clustering loops , straight downward falling , Till o ' er the river pois ' d , the twain yet one , a moment ' s lull , A motionless still balance in the air , then parting , talons loosing , Upward again on slow - firm pinions slanting , their separate diverse flight , She hers , he his , pursuing .
} A Child ' s Amaze
Silent and amazed even when a little boy , I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements , As contending against some being or influence .
Women sit or move to and fro , some old , some young , The young are beautiful -- but the old are more beautiful than the young .
Of justice -- as If could be any thing but the same ample law , expounded by natural judges and saviors , As if it might be this thing or that thing , according to decisions .

} From Paumanok Starting I Fly Like a Bird
Poet : O A new song , a free song , Flapping , flapping , flapping , flapping , by sounds , by voices clearer , By the wind ' s voice and that of the drum , By the banner ' s voice and child ' s voice and sea ' s voice and father ' s voice , Low on the ground and high in the air , On the ground where father and child stand , In the upward air where their eyes turn , Where the banner at daybreak is flapping .
Father : Cease , cease , my foolish babe , What you are saying is sorrowful to me , much ' t displeases me ; Behold with the rest again I say , behold not banners and pennants aloft , But the well - prepared pavements behold , and mark the solid - wall ' d houses .
aye !)
in life and death supreme , We , even we , henceforth flaunt out masterful , high up above , Not for the present alone , for a thousand years chanting through you , This song to the soul of one poor little child .
Father : Child of mine you fill me with anguish , To be that pennant would be too fearful , Little you know what it is this day , and after this day , forever , It is to gain nothing , but risk and defy every thing , Forward to stand in front of wars -- and O , such wars !-- what have you to do with them ?
Poet : My limbs , my veins dilate , my theme is clear at last , Banner so broad advancing out of the night , I sing you haughty and resolute , I burst through where I waited long , too long , deafen ' d and blinded , My hearing and tongue are come to me , ( a little child taught me ,) I hear from above O pennant of war your ironical call and demand , Insensate !
insensate !
Valueless , object of eyes , over all and demanding all --( absolute owner of all )-- O banner and pennant !
I too leave the rest -- great as it is , it is nothing -- houses , machines are nothing -- I see them not , I see but you , O warlike pennant !
} Rise O Days from Your Fathomless Deeps
What , to passions I witness around me to - day ?
behold what comes here , How it climbs with daring feet and hands -- how it dashes !
stride on , Democracy !
strike with vengeful stroke !
The noble sire fallen on evil days , I saw with hand uplifted , menacing , brandishing , ( Memories of old in abeyance , love and faith in abeyance ,) The insane knife toward the Mother of All .
Spring up O city -- not for peace alone , but be indeed yourself , warlike !
I have rejected nothing you offer ' d me -- whom you adopted I have adopted , Good or bad I never question you -- I love all -- I do not condemn any thing , I chant and celebrate all that is yours -- yet peace no more , In peace I chanted peace , but now the drum of war is mine , War , red war is my song through your streets , O city !
[ The Centenarian ] When I clutch ' d your hand it was not with terror , But suddenly pouring about me here on every side , And below there where the boys were drilling , and up the slopes they ran , And where tents are pitch ' d , and wherever you see south and south - east and south - west , Over hills , across lowlands , and in the skirts of woods , And along the shores , in mire ( now fill ' d over ) came again and suddenly raged , As eighty - five years agone no mere parade receiv ' d with applause of friends , But a battle which I took part in myself -- aye , long ago as it is , I took part in it , Walking then this hilltop , this same ground .
I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish .
[ Terminus ] Enough , the Centenarian ' s story ends , The two , the past and present , have interchanged , I myself as connecter , as chansonnier of a great future , am now speaking .
far , far out of reach , studded , breaking out , the eternal stars .
} By the Bivouac ' s Fitful Flame
Lo , ' tis autumn , Lo , where the trees , deeper green , yellower and redder , Cool and sweeten Ohio ' s villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind , Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis ' d vines , ( Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines ?
A march in the ranks hard - prest , and the road unknown , A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness , Our army foil ' d with loss severe , and the sullen remnant retreating , Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim - lighted building , We come to an open space in the woods , and halt by the dim - lighted building , ' Tis a large old church at the crossing roads , now an impromptu hospital , Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made , Shadows of deepest , deepest black , just lit by moving candles and lamps , And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke , By these , crowds , groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor , some in the pews laid down , At my feet more distinctly a soldier , a mere lad , in danger of bleeding to death , ( he is shot in the abdomen ,) I stanch the blood temporarily , ( the youngster ' s face is white as a lily ,) Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o ' er the scene fain to absorb it all , Faces , varieties , postures beyond description , most in obscurity , some of them dead , Surgeons operating , attendants holding lights , the smell of ether , odor of blood , The crowd , O the crowd of the bloody forms , the yard outside also fill ' d , Some on the bare ground , some on planks or stretchers , some in the death - spasm sweating , An occasional scream or cry , the doctor ' s shouted orders or calls , The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches , These I resume as I chant , I see again the forms , I smell the odor , Then hear outside the orders given , Fall in , my men , fall in ; But first I bend to the dying lad , his eyes open , a half - smile gives he me , Then the eyes close , calmly close , and I speed forth to the darkness , Resuming , marching , ever in darkness marching , on in the ranks , The unknown road still marching .
} A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim
Curious I halt and silent stand , Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first just lift the blanket ; Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim , with well - gray ' d hair , and flesh all sunken about the eyes ?
As toilsome I wander ' d Virginia ' s woods , To the music of rustling leaves kick ' d by my feet , ( for ' twas autumn ,) I mark ' d at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier ; Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat , ( easily all could understand ,) The halt of a mid - day hour , when up !
Year that trembled and reel ' d beneath me !
I onward go , I stop , With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds , I am firm with each , the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable , One turns to me his appealing eyes -- poor boy !
Give me interminable eyes -- give me women -- give me comrades and lovers by the thousand !
I hear the great drums pounding , And the small drums steady whirring , And every blow of the great convulsive drums , Strikes me through and through .
O lands !

Race of the soil , ready for conflict -- race of the conquering march !

O tan - faced prairie - boy , Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift , Praises and presents came and nourishing food , till at last among the recruits , You came , taciturn , with nothing to give -- we but look ' d on each other , When lo !

} Turn O Libertad
1 When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom ' d , And the great star early droop ' d in the western sky in the night , I mourn ' d , and yet shall mourn with ever - returning spring .
Ever - returning spring , trinity sure to me you bring , Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west , And thought of him I love .
7 ( Nor for you , for one alone , Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring , For fresh as the morning , thus would I chant a song for you O sane and sacred death .
You only I hear -- yet the star holds me , ( but will soon depart ,) Yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me .
Then I chant it for thee , I glorify thee above all , I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come , come unfalteringly .
O Captain !
dear father !
By blue Ontario ' s shore , As I mused of these warlike days and of peace return ' d , and the dead that return no more , A Phantom gigantic superb , with stern visage accosted me , Chant me the poem , it said , that comes from the soul of America , chant me the carol of victory , And strike up the marches of Libertad , marches more powerful yet , And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy .

And I saw the free souls of poets , The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me , Strange large men , long unwaked , undisclosed , were disclosed to me .

Thou groan ' st with riches , thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing - garment , Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions , A myriad - twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast demesne , As some huge ship freighted to water ' s edge thou ridest into port , As rain falls from the heaven and vapors rise from earth , so have the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of thee ; Thou envy of the globe !

What chemistry !
That the winds are really not infectious , That this is no cheat , this transparent green - wash of the sea which is so amorous after me , That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues , That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves in it , That all is clean forever and forever , That the cool drink from the well tastes so good , That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy , That the fruits of the apple - orchard and the orange - orchard , that melons , grapes , peaches , plums , will none of them poison me , That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease , Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once catching disease .
Keep on -- Liberty is to be subserv ' d whatever occurs ; That is nothing that is quell ' d by one or two failures , or any number of failures , Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people , or by any unfaithfulness , Or the show of the tushes of power , soldiers , cannon , penal statutes .

} Song of Prudence
Not one word or deed , not venereal sore , discoloration , privacy of the onanist , Putridity of gluttons or rum - drinkers , peculation , cunning , betrayal , murder , seduction , prostitution , But has results beyond death as really as before death .
Convict no more , nor shame , nor dole !
Depart -- a God - enfranchis ' d soul !
O sight of pity , shame and dole !
To glide with thee O soul , o ' er all , in all , as a ship o ' er the waters ; Gathering these hints , the preludes , the blue sky , the grass , the morning drops of dew , The lilac - scent , the bushes with dark green heart - shaped leaves , Wood - violets , the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence , Samples and sorts not for themselves alone , but for their atmosphere , To grace the bush I love -- to sing with the birds , A warble for joy of returning in reminiscence .
In one , among the city streets a laborer ' s home appear ' d , After his day ' s work done , cleanly , sweet - air ' d , the gaslight burning , The carpet swept and a fire in the cheerful stove .
In one a trio beautiful , Grandmother , loving daughter , loving daughter ' s daughter , sat , Chatting and sewing .
For I see every word utter ' d thence has deeper , sweeter , new sounds , impossible on less terms .
I see brains and lips closed , tympans and temples unstruck , Until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose , Until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies slumbering forever ready in all words .
Me ruthless and devilish as any , that my wrists are not chain ' d with iron , or my ankles with iron ?

Go , dear friend , if need be give up all else , and commence to - day to inure yourself to pluck , reality , self - esteem , definiteness , elevatedness , Rest not till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality .
Who includes diversity and is Nature , Who is the amplitude of the earth , and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth , and the great charity of the earth , and the equilibrium also , Who has not look ' d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing , or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing , Who contains believers and disbelievers , who is the most majestic lover , Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism , spiritualism , and of the aesthetic or intellectual , Who having consider ' d the body finds all its organs and parts good , Who , out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories , The theory of a city , a poem , and of the large politics of these States ; Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon , but in other globes with their suns and moons , Who , constructing the house of himself or herself , not for a day but for all time , sees races , eras , dates , generations , The past , the future , dwelling there , like space , inseparable together .

how uneasy they are when he moves away from them ; Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them , ( books , politics , poems , depart -- all else departs ,) I confess I envy only his fascination -- my silent , illiterate friend , Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms , In the northern county far , in the placid pastoral region .

The tongues of violins , ( I think O tongues ye tell this heart , that cannot tell itself , This brooding yearning heart , that cannot tell itself .)
All songs of current lands come sounding round me , The German airs of friendship , wine and love , Irish ballads , merry jigs and dances , English warbles , Chansons of France , Scotch tunes , and o ' er the rest , Italia ' s peerless compositions .
Across the stage with pallor on her face , yet lurid passion , Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand .
To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven , The clear electric base and baritone of the world , The trombone duo , Libertad forever !

2 Passage O soul to India !
You too with joy I sing .
A worship new I sing , You captains , voyagers , explorers , yours , You engineers , you architects , machinists , yours , You , not for trade or transportation only , But in God ' s name , and for thy sake O soul .
Lo soul for thee of tableaus twain , I see in one the Suez canal initiated , open ' d , I see the procession of steamships , the Empress Engenie ' s leading the van , I mark from on deck the strange landscape , the pure sky , the level sand in the distance , I pass swiftly the picturesque groups , the workmen gather ' d , The gigantic dredging machines .
In one again , different , ( yet thine , all thine , O soul , the same ,) I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier , I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying freight and passengers , I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring , and the shrill steam - whistle , I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world , I cross the Laramie plains , I note the rocks in grotesque shapes , the buttes , I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions , the barren , colorless , sage - deserts , I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the great mountains , I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch mountains , I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle ' s Nest , I pass the Promontory , I ascend the Nevadas , I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base , I see the Humboldt range , I thread the valley and cross the river , I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe , I see forests of majestic pines , Or crossing the great desert , the alkaline plains , I behold enchanting mirages of waters and meadows , Marking through these and after all , in duplicate slender lines , Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel , Tying the Eastern to the Western sea , The road between Europe and Asia .
( unloving earth , without a throb to answer ours , Cold earth , the place of graves .)
Yet soul be sure the first intent remains , and shall be carried out , Perhaps even now the time has arrived .
6 Year at whose wide - flung door I sing !
( No mere doge of Venice now wedding the Adriatic ,) I see O year in you the vast terraqueous globe given and giving all , Europe to Asia , Africa join ' d , and they to the New World , The lands , geographies , dancing before you , holding a festival garland , As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand .
Lo soul , the retrospect brought forward , The old , most populous , wealthiest of earth ' s lands , The streams of the Indus and the Ganges and their many affluents , ( I my shores of America walking to - day behold , resuming all ,) The tale of Alexander on his warlike marches suddenly dying , On one side China and on the other side Persia and Arabia , To the south the great seas and the bay of Bengal , The flowing literatures , tremendous epics , religions , castes , Old occult Brahma interminably far back , the tender and junior Buddha , Central and southern empires and all their belongings , possessors , The wars of Tamerlane , the reign of Aurungzebe , The traders , rulers , explorers , Moslems , Venetians , Byzantium , the Arabs , Portuguese , The first travelers famous yet , Marco Polo , Batouta the Moor , Doubts to be solv ' d , the map incognita , blanks to be fill ' d , The foot of man unstay ' d , the hands never at rest , Thyself O soul that will not brook a challenge .
And who art thou sad shade ?
O Thou transcendent , Nameless , the fibre and the breath , Light of the light , shedding forth universes , thou centre of them , Thou mightier centre of the true , the good , the loving , Thou moral , spiritual fountain -- affection ' s source -- thou reservoir , ( O pensive soul of me -- O thirst unsatisfied -- waitest not there ?
Waitest not haply for us somewhere there the Comrade perfect ?)
For others ' sake to suffer all ?
Reckoning ahead O soul , when thou , the time achiev ' d , The seas all cross ' d , weather ' d the capes , the voyage done , Surrounded , copest , frontest God , yieldest , the aim attain ' d , As fill ' d with friendship , love complete , the Elder Brother found , The Younger melts in fondness in his arms .
Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights ?
Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas ?
You , strew ' d with the wrecks of skeletons , that , living , never reach ' d you .
the blood burns in my veins !
O my brave soul !
are they not all the seas of God ?
O I am sure they really came from Thee , The urge , the ardor , the unconquerable will , The potent , felt , interior command , stronger than words , A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep , These sped me on .
[ BOOK XXVIII ]
1 I wander all night in my vision , Stepping with light feet , swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping , Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers , Wandering and confused , lost to myself , ill - assorted , contradictory , Pausing , gazing , bending , and stopping .
How solemn they look there , stretch ' d and still , How quiet they breathe , the little children in their cradles .
The wretched features of ennuyes , the white features of corpses , the livid faces of drunkards , the sick - gray faces of onanists , The gash ' d bodies on battle - fields , the insane in their strong - door ' d rooms , the sacred idiots , the new - born emerging from gates , and the dying emerging from gates , The night pervades them and infolds them .
Double yourself and receive me darkness , Receive me and my lover too , he will not let me go without him .
Darkness , you are gentler than my lover , his flesh was sweaty and panting , I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me .
Will you kill the courageous giant ?
4 I turn but do not extricate myself , Confused , a past - reading , another , but with darkness yet .
I look where the ship helplessly heads end on , I hear the burst as she strikes , I hear the howls of dismay , they grow fainter and fainter .
5 Now of the older war - days , the defeat at Brooklyn , Washington stands inside the lines , he stands on the intrench ' d hills amid a crowd of officers .
6 Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together , Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on the old homestead .
The homeward bound and the outward bound , The beautiful lost swimmer , the ennuye , the onanist , the female that loves unrequited , the money - maker , The actor and actress , those through with their parts and those waiting to commence , The affectionate boy , the husband and wife , the voter , the nominee that is chosen and the nominee that has fail ' d , The great already known and the great any time after to - day , The stammerer , the sick , the perfect - form ' d , the homely , The criminal that stood in the box , the judge that sat and sentenced him , the fluent lawyers , the jury , the audience , The laugher and weeper , the dancer , the midnight widow , the red squaw , The consumptive , the erysipalite , the idiot , he that is wrong ' d , The antipodes , and every one between this and them in the dark , I swear they are averaged now -- one is no better than the other , The night and sleep have liken ' d them and restored them .
I too pass from the night , I stay a while away O night , but I return to you again and love you .
I am not afraid , I have been well brought forward by you , I love the rich running day , but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long , I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you , but I know I came well and shall go well .
Let the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever bawling -- let an idiot or insane person appear on each of the stands ; Let judges and criminals be transposed -- let the prison - keepers be put in prison -- let those that were prisoners take the keys ; Let them that distrust birth and death lead the rest .
He was a good fellow , free - mouth ' d , quick - temper ' d , not bad - looking , Ready with life or death for a friend , fond of women , gambled , ate hearty , drank hearty , Had known what it was to be flush , grew low - spirited toward the last , sicken ' d , was help ' d by a contribution , Died , aged forty - one years -- and that was his funeral .

or the beautiful maternal cares ?
These also flow onward to others , you and I flow onward , But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them .

yourself , for ever and ever !
7 It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father , it is to identify you , It is not that you should be undecided , but that you should be decided , Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form ' d in you , You are henceforth secure , whatever comes or goes .
8 Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth , Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried , and they on the Atlantic side and they on the Pacific , And they between , and all through the Mississippi country , and all over the earth .
for we are betray ' d , Then indeed suspicion of death .
Pleasantly and well - suited I walk , Whither I walk I cannot define , but I know it is good , The whole universe indicates that it is good , The past and the present indicate that it is good .
How beautiful and perfect are the animals !
The trees have , rooted in the ground !
That the exquisite scheme is for it , and the nebulous float is for it , and the cohering is for it !
I know it not O soul , Nor dost thou , all is a blank before us , All waits undream ' d of in that region , that inaccessible land .
Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me , The call of my nearest lover , putting forth , alarm ' d , uncertain , The sea I am quickly to sail , come tell me , Come tell me where I am speeding , tell me my destination .
I understand your anguish , but I cannot help you , I approach , hear , behold , the sad mouth , the look out of the eyes , your mute inquiry , Whither I go from the bed I recline on , come tell me ,-- Old age , alarm ' d , uncertain -- a young woman ' s voice , appealing to me for comfort ; A young man ' s voice , Shall I not escape ?
As if a phantom caress ' d me , I thought I was not alone walking here by the shore ; But the one I thought was with me as now I walk by the shore , the one I loved that caress ' d me , As I lean and look through the glimmering light , that one has utterly disappear ' d .
I do not doubt that wrecks at sea , no matter what the horrors of them , no matter whose wife , child , husband , father , lover , has gone down , are provided for , to the minutest points , I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any time , is provided for in the inherences of things , I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space , but I believe Heavenly Death provides for all .
What ship puzzled at sea , cons for the true reckoning ?
Here , sailor !
And you O my soul where you stand , Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space , Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to connect them , Till the bridge you will need be form ' d , till the ductile anchor hold , Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul .

Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will measure myself by them , And now touch ' d with the lives of other globes arrived as far along as those of the earth , Or waiting to arrive , or pass ' d on farther than those of the earth , I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life , Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine , or waiting to arrive .
} Thought
As I sit with others at a great feast , suddenly while the music is playing , To my mind , ( whence it comes I know not ,) spectral in mist of a wreck at sea , Of certain ships , how they sail from port with flying streamers and wafted kisses , and that is the last of them , Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President , Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder ' d off the Northeast coast and going down -- of the steamship Arctic going down , Of the veil ' d tableau - women gather ' d together on deck , pale , heroic , waiting the moment that draws so close -- O the moment !
A huge sob -- a few bubbles -- the white foam spirting up -- and then the women gone , Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on -- and I now pondering , Are those women indeed gone ?
Through thy reality , lo , the immortal idea !
And yet thou living present brain , heir of the dead , the Old World brain , Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its folds so long , Thou carefully prepared by it so long -- haply thou but unfoldest it , only maturest it , It to eventuate in thee -- the essence of the by - gone time contain ' d in thee , Its poems , churches , arts , unwitting to themselves , destined with reference to thee ; Thou but the apples , long , long , long a - growing , The fruit of all the Old ripening to - day in thee .
my special word to thee .
( Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive , I know before the fitting man all Nature yields , Though answering not in words , the skies , trees , hear his voice -- and thou O sun , As for thy throes , thy perturbations , sudden breaks and shafts of flame gigantic , I understand them , I know those flames , those perturbations well .)
} Faces
This face is a life - boat , This is the face commanding and bearded , it asks no odds of the rest , This face is flavor ' d fruit ready for eating , This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good .
I am fully content .
3 Blow trumpeter free and clear , I follow thee , While at thy liquid prelude , glad , serene , The fretting world , the streets , the noisy hours of day withdraw , A holy calm descends like dew upon me , I walk in cool refreshing night the walks of Paradise , I scent the grass , the moist air and the roses ; Thy song expands my numb ' d imbonded spirit , thou freest , launchest me , Floating and basking upon heaven ' s lake .
4 Blow again trumpeter !
and for thy theme , Take now the enclosing theme of all , the solvent and the setting , Love , that is pulse of all , the sustenance and the pang , The heart of man and woman all for love , No other theme but love -- knitting , enclosing , all - diffusing love .
O magnet - south !
O quick mettle , rich blood , impulse and love !
city of spires and masts !
O me , man of slack faith so long , Standing aloof , denying portions so long , Only aware to - day of compact all - diffused truth , Discovering to - day there is no lie or form of lie , and can be none , but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself , Or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does .
How many ships have sail ' d and sunk for it !
How the bright fascinating lambent flames of it , in every age and land , have drawn men ' s eyes , Rich as a sunset on the Norway coast , the sky , the islands , and the cliffs , Or midnight ' s silent glowing northern lights unreachable .
O I think it is I -- I think no one was ever happier than I , And who has lavish ' d all ?
You degradations , you tussle with passions and appetites , You smarts from dissatisfied friendships , ( ah wounds the sharpest of all !)
You toil of painful and choked articulations , you meannesses , You shallow tongue - talks at tables , ( my tongue the shallowest of any ;) You broken resolutions , you racking angers , you smother ' d ennuis !
Of the President with pale face asking secretly to himself , What will the people say at last ?

Nor think we forget thee maternal ; Lag ' d ' st thou so long ?
} By Broad Potomac ' s Shore
Give me of you O spring , before I close , to put between its pages !
From far Dakota ' s canyons , Lands of the wild ravine , the dusky Sioux , the lonesome stretch , the silence , Haply to - day a mournful wall , haply a trumpet - note for heroes .
Of scenes of Nature , fields and mountains , Of skies so beauteous after a storm , and at night the moon so unearthly bright , Shining sweetly , shining down , where we dig the trenches and gather the heaps , I dream , I dream , I dream .
thick - sprinkled bunting !
To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse ?
But I too announce solid things , Science , ships , politics , cities , factories , are not nothing , Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring , triumphantly moving , and grander heaving in sight , They stand for realities -- all is as it should be .
Then my realities ; What else is so real as mine ?
Libertad and the divine average , freedom to every slave on the face of the earth , The rapt promises and lumine of seers , the spiritual world , these centuries - lasting songs , And our visions , the visions of poets , the most solid announcements of any .
I shall go forth , I shall traverse the States awhile , but I cannot tell whither or how long , Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice will suddenly cease .
must all then amount to but this ?
-- and yet it is enough , O soul ; O soul , we have positively appear ' d -- that is enough .
Your dreams O years , how they penetrate through me !
( I know not whether I sleep or wake ;) The perform ' d America and Europe grow dim , retiring in shadow behind me , The unperform ' d , more gigantic than ever , advance , advance upon me .
Faces so pale with wondrous eyes , very dear , gather closer yet , Draw close , but speak not .
Perfume from battle - fields rising , up from the foetor arising .
Perfume therefore my chant , O love , immortal love , Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers , Shroud them , embalm them , cover them all over with tender pride .
2 Of seeds dropping into the ground , of births , Of the steady concentration of America , inland , upward , to impregnable and swarming places , Of what Indiana , Kentucky , Arkansas , and the rest , are to be , Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska , Colorado , Nevada , and the rest , ( Or afar , mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska ,) Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for -- and of what all sights , North , South , East and West , are , Of this Union welded in blood , of the solemn price paid , of the unnamed lost ever present in my mind ; Of the temporary use of materials for identity ' s sake , Of the present , passing , departing -- of the growth of completer men than any yet , Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother , the Mississippi flows , Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey ' d and unsuspected , Of the new and good names , of the modern developments , of inalienable homesteads , Of a free and original life there , of simple diet and clean and sweet blood , Of litheness , majestic faces , clear eyes , and perfect physique there , Of immense spiritual results future years far West , each side of the Anahuacs , Of these songs , well understood there , ( being made for that area ,) Of the native scorn of grossness and gain there , ( O it lurks in me night and day -- what is gain after all to savageness and freedom ?)
Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness , Eyes of my soul seeing perfection , Natural life of me faithfully praising things , Corroborating forever the triumph of things .
Illustrious what we name space , sphere of unnumber ' d spirits , Illustrious the mystery of motion in all beings , even the tiniest insect , Illustrious the attribute of speech , the senses , the body , Illustrious the passing light -- illustrious the pale reflection on the new moon in the western sky , Illustrious whatever I see or hear or touch , to the last .
To be this incredible God I am !
How the clouds pass silently overhead !
How the trees rise and stand up , with strong trunks , with branches and leaves !
O setting sun !
As at thy portals also death , Entering thy sovereign , dim , illimitable grounds , To memories of my mother , to the divine blending , maternity , To her , buried and gone , yet buried not , gone not from me , ( I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still , I sit by the form in the coffin , I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips , the cheeks , the closed eyes in the coffin ;) To her , the ideal woman , practical , spiritual , of all of earth , life , love , to me the best , I grave a monumental line , before I go , amid these songs , And set a tombstone here .
} Pensive on Her Dead Gazing
O my dead , an aroma sweet !
} The Sobbing of the Bells [ Midnight , Sept . 19 - 20 , 1881 ]
As they draw to a close , Of what underlies the precedent songs -- of my aims in them , Of the seed I have sought to plant in them , Of joy , sweet joy , through many a year , in them , ( For them , for them have I lived , in them my work is done ,) Of many an aspiration fond , of many a dream and plan ; Through Space and Time fused in a chant , and the flowing eternal identity , To Nature encompassing these , encompassing God -- to the joyous , electric all , To the sense of Death , and accepting exulting in Death in its turn the same as life , The entrance of man to sing ; To compact you , ye parted , diverse lives , To put rapport the mountains and rocks and streams , And the winds of the north , and the forests of oak and pine , With you O soul .
Joy , shipmate , Joy !
To conclude , I announce what comes after me .
When America does what was promis ' d , When through these States walk a hundred millions of superb persons , When the rest part away for superb persons and contribute to them , When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America , Then to me and mine our due fruition .
I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity only , I announce the Union more and more compact , indissoluble , I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous politics of the earth insignificant .
I announce a man or woman coming , perhaps you are the one , ( So long !)
I announce the great individual , fluid as Nature , chaste , affectionate , compassionate , fully arm ' d .
O thicker and faster --( So long !)
O crowding too close upon me , I foresee too much , it means more than I thought , It appears to me I am dying .
Camerado , this is no book , Who touches this touches a man , ( Is it night ?
O how your fingers drowse me , Your breath falls around me like dew , your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears , I feel immerged from head to foot , Delicious , enough .
Remember my words , I may again return , I love you , I depart from materials , I am as one disembodied , triumphant , dead .
One side thy inland ocean laving , broad , with copious commerce , steamers , sails , And one the Atlantic ' s wind caressing , fierce or gentle -- mighty hulls dark - gliding in the distance .

What subtle indirection and significance in you ?

} Election Day , November , 1884
Where day and night I wend thy surf - beat shore , Imaging to my sense thy varied strange suggestions , ( I see and plainly list thy talk and conference here ,) Thy troops of white - maned racers racing to the goal , Thy ample , smiling face , dash ' d with the sparkling dimples of the sun , Thy brooding scowl and murk -- thy unloos ' d hurricanes , Thy unsubduedness , caprices , wilfulness ; Great as thou art above the rest , thy many tears -- a lack from all eternity in thy content , ( Naught but the greatest struggles , wrongs , defeats , could make thee greatest -- no less could make thee ,) Thy lonely state -- something thou ever seek ' st and seek ' st , yet never gain ' st , Surely some right withheld -- some voice , in huge monotonous rage , of freedom - lover pent , Some vast heart , like a planet ' s , chain ' d and chafing in those breakers , By lengthen ' d swell , and spasm , and panting breath , And rhythmic rasping of thy sands and waves , And serpent hiss , and savage peals of laughter , And undertones of distant lion roar , ( Sounding , appealing to the sky ' s deaf ear -- but now , rapport for once , A phantom in the night thy confidant for once ,) The first and last confession of the globe , Outsurging , muttering from thy soul ' s abysms , The tale of cosmic elemental passion , Thou tellest to a kindred soul .
Upon this scene , this show , Yielded to - day by fashion , learning , wealth , ( Nor in caprice alone -- some grains of deepest meaning ,) Haply , aloft , ( who knows ?)

' tis but the same -- the heir legitimate , continued ever , The indomitable heart and arm -- proofs of the never - broken line , Courage , alertness , patience , faith , the same -- e ' en in defeat defeated not , the same :) Wherever sails a ship , or house is built on land , or day or night , Through teeming cities ' streets , indoors or out , factories or farms , Now , or to come , or past -- where patriot wills existed or exist , Wherever Freedom , pois ' d by Toleration , sway ' d by Law , Stands or is rising thy true monument .

Ever the undiscouraged , resolute , struggling soul of man ; ( Have former armies fail ' d ?
My Days I sing , and the Lands -- with interstice I knew of hapless War .
Here first the duties of to - day , the lessons of the concrete , Wealth , order , travel , shelter , products , plenty ; As of the building of some varied , vast , perpetual edifice , Whence to arise inevitable in time , the towering roofs , the lamps , The solid - planted spires tall shooting to the stars .
} The Calming Thought of All
Thine eyes , ears -- all thy best attributes -- all that takes cognizance of natural beauty , Shall wake and fill .
While not the past forgetting , To - day , at least , contention sunk entire -- peace , brotherhood uprisen ; For sign reciprocal our Northern , Southern hands , Lay on the graves of all dead soldiers , North or South , ( Nor for the past alone -- for meanings to the future ,) Wreaths of roses and branches of palm .
Have you not learn ' d great lessons from those who reject you , and brace themselves against you ?
Shot gold , maroon and violet , dazzling silver , emerald , fawn , The earth ' s whole amplitude and Nature ' s multiform power consign ' d for once to colors ; The light , the general air possess ' d by them -- colors till now unknown , No limit , confine -- not the Western sky alone -- the high meridian -- North , South , all , Pure luminous color fighting the silent shadows to the last .
} Twenty Years
What of the future ?)
some future spring , some summer -- bursting forth , To verdant leaves , or sheltering shade -- to nourishing fruit , Apples and grapes -- the stalwart limbs of trees emerging -- the fresh , free , open air , And love and faith , like scented roses blooming .
As the Greek ' s signal flame , by antique records told , Rose from the hill - top , like applause and glory , Welcoming in fame some special veteran , hero , With rosy tinge reddening the land he ' d served , So I aloft from Mannahatta ' s ship - fringed shore , Lift high a kindled brand for thee , Old Poet .

} Lingering Last Drops
Good - bye my fancy --( I had a word to say , But ' tis not quite the time -- The best of any man ' s word or say , Is when its proper place arrives -- and for its meaning , I keep mine till the last .)
A vague mist hanging ' round half the pages : ( Sometimes how strange and clear to the soul , That all these solid things are indeed but apparitions , concepts , non - realities .)

} Interpolation Sounds
Over and through the burial chant , Organ and solemn service , sermon , bending priests , To me come interpolation sounds not in the show -- plainly to me , crowding up the aisle and from the window , Of sudden battle ' s hurry and harsh noises -- war ' s grim game to sight and ear in earnest ; The scout call ' d up and forward -- the general mounted and his aides around him -- the new - brought word -- the instantaneous order issued ; The rifle crack -- the cannon thud -- the rushing forth of men from their tents ; The clank of cavalry -- the strange celerity of forming ranks -- the slender bugle note ; The sound of horses ' hoofs departing -- saddles , arms , accoutrements .
} To the Sun - Set Breeze
with as now thy bending neck and head , with courteous hand and word , ascending , Thou !
} A Christmas Greeting
Sounds of the winter too , Sunshine upon the mountains -- many a distant strain From cheery railroad train -- from nearer field , barn , house , The whispering air -- even the mute crops , garner ' d apples , corn , Children ' s and women ' s tones -- rhythm of many a farmer and of flail , An old man ' s garrulous lips among the rest , Think not we give out yet , Forth from these snowy hairs we keep up yet the lilt .
Thou waters that encompass us !
Thou that in all the life and death of us , in action or in sleep !
Thou laws invisible that permeate them and all , Thou that in all , and over all , and through and under all , incessant !

Grand is the seen , the light , to me -- grand are the sky and stars , Grand is the earth , and grand are lasting time and space , And grand their laws , so multiform , puzzling , evolutionary ; But grander far the unseen soul of me , comprehending , endowing all those , Lighting the light , the sky and stars , delving the earth , sailing the sea , ( What were all those , indeed , without thee , unseen soul ?
} Good - Bye My Fancy !
Long have we lived , joy ' d , caress ' d together ; Delightful !-- now separation -- Good - bye my Fancy .
Yet let me not be too hasty , Long indeed have we lived , slept , filter ' d , become really blended into one ; Then if we die we die together , ( yes , we ' ll remain one ,) If we go anywhere we ' ll go together to meet what happens , May - be we ' ll be better off and blither , and learn something , May - be it is yourself now really ushering me to the true songs , ( who knows ?)
