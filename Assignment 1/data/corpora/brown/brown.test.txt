Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line .
The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .
But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone '' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters .

`` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign '' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign '' .

Pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house .
The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction .
Heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems .
Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation .
-- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today .
It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine .
A full trial was ordered for :
Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced .
A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce .
In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books .
Only Miss Gee asked for bail .
He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets .
It could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month .
It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes .
Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid .
The three -- Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws .
`` In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy '' , Sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal '' .
No comments by U.S.
In opening , D. Arthur Connelly , assistant United States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments .
Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears .
But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted .
His losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck .
-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach .
Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity .
`` All we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way Mother wanted '' , Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon .
`` Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family , Pohly said .
But today he wanted to make a public statement .

The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today .
Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home .
A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 , he said .
The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana .
He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens .
The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam .
There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources .
The broadcast said Anderson , a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman , and McNair , of Miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels .

Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern .
`` In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' .
He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' .

The heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader .
That meeting produced the `` spirit of Camp David '' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement .
Attitude flexible
At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader .
There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly .
At the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure .
The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back .
Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies .
Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity .
Finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord .

Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse .
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that .
They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made .
Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility .
American Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' -- the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities .
Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees .
This is not an isolated example ; ;
It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot .
At the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis .
The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns '' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty .
Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype .
Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place .
There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels .
Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order .
In the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' .
The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained .
it must play a game in which there never is a winner .
Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy .
Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market .
Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time .
The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows .
The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ?
The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining .
In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' .
Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' .
Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation .
In the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer .
Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws .

`` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament .
After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th .
End at seven
As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 .
But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken .
When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige .
As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments .
Instant rivalry
Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg .
or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ;
As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender .
On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament .
And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did .
At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green .
Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it .
When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe .

Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real .
This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them .
In Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games .
Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` The important thing is to win the pennant '' .
Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` I hope Roger hits 80 '' , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and I hope I hit 81 '' ) .
The three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture .
Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris .
To an extent , the two even look alike .
With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order .
Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York .
Light reading :
`` That's ( Yogi ) Berra's .
`` When I've made a dumb play '' , he says , `` I don't want to talk to anyone .
Benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer : `` I can't play for you .
( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa. .
) `` That's the way I am '' , he says .
`` When I was a kid '' , Maris told a sportswriter last week , `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not '' .
`` You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' .
He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him '' .
Maris's throwing arm is stronger .
Yet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : The home run .
( American League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams .
I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! !
A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff .
Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.S. Senate , then went their respective ways .

On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale .
He gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best .
He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : `` I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about '' .
He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting .
Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city .
Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town .
he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 .
The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good .
By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa .
The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil .
First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it .
And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up .
However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting .
They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings .
Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected .
) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well .
But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo .
The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops .
On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' .
urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army .
On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio .
The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable .

Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative .
Swelling traffic .
And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession .
Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter .
For the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period .
The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 .

Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners .
What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ?
The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse .
The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system .
The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers .
It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide .
This kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course .
The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ;
Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today .
The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life .
We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ;
We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word .
Assembly session brought much good
Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government .
Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state .
We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation .
The harder the choice , the more willing the league is to wade in .
Coupling its own budget of $83,750 with a $30,000 state grant authorized by Gov. Vandiver , the group expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech. .

Georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost from the General Assembly in the form of a $1,750,000 budget increase for the Milledgeville State Hospital .
Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is .
The national average is more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low .
The intensive treatment program is working well .
The boost is helpful but inadequate .
But the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition .
Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines .
But after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans .
There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba , previously a bete noire to Trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces .
What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle .
Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger .
High-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial Parkway , operating between downtown Washington and Cabin John , Glen Echo and Brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency can do for this city .
The NCTA is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of Congress .
The wartime protocol of September 12 , 1944 , designated a special `` Greater Berlin '' area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation .
Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the West German misgivings about `` salami '' tactics , it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy's representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed .
Whisky on the air
Why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads , is it necessary to seek congressional action ? ?
Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which TV soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied , there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him into downing bourbon .
For Mr. Kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation .
But since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers .
The world awaits Mr. Khrushchev's choice of alternatives .
The funds would be used for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation .

Mr. Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label .
There are only two men remaining in Congress who , with Rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917 .
And it was the House he loved .
And those still with us , Herbert C. Hoover , Harry S. Truman , Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy .
He was a fighter for those of his own party .
As it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration .
Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends .
In 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle .
Simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river .
The main question raised by the incident is how much longer will UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ? ?
A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information .
Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need .
The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands .
Meditations from a fallout shelter
The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort .
Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man , Che Guevara , who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas , Venezuela .
It was on the eve of a momentous U.N. session to come to grips with cold war issues .
His firm hand will be desperately missed .
He earnestly urged a cease-fire .
The death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' most controversial leader .

A short report and a good one
`` No complaints or charges have been filed during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group .
`` The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights '' .
It could go either way , since the gains for both points of view were about the same .
The principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled .
According to The Chicago Tribune News Service , State Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name : 1 .

And what you can't see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too .
The only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment .
Closed doors in city hall
The people , in delegating authority , do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know .
Despite the lip service paid by local governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations .
If the Dominican Republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship .
Outwardly , Ciudad Trujillo is calm .
He will need the help of all OAS members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike .
The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union members .
This shouldn't surprise the secretary ; ;
American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long time .
The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department .
But those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first of all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes .
Self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress .
But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends .
James P. Mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below three million a couple of years ago .
Mr. Mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated .
And from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western posture .
Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement .
And now Mr. Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point .
He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump .
Corroborating Mr. Hodges' figures was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4 .
Mr. Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes .
In New Jersey , too
It will be a 16-hour training day .
The Federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri's depressed areas , and in the long run that will benefit St. Louis as well .
Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame , the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their credit .

Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with Gen. J. M. Swing , an Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service .
His words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding .
This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months .
The rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November .
The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be , as the Charter puts it , `` the chief administrative officer of the Organization '' , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority `` external to the Organization '' .
What we must have , if the United Nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it , subject to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's ambition .
The new City Charter , which should get a Yes vote as Question No. 1 on Nov. 7 , would not make a good Mayor out of a bad one .
Thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative .
A road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected .
The I. A. P. A. is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere ; ;

His earlier reports considered the American public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change .
There is room for disagreement concerning some of Dr. Conant's specific views .

But DeKalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money .

`` Don't ask me if I think the cannery helps '' , he said .
Several years ago I was his pastor .
It will do no good to seek God's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong .

Her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said .

She has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting .
I do not know Dr. Wilson Sneed well .
A man who gives himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving .
And a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to .
We expect him to be noble , and to make us so -- yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be .

Walking along the lake before breakfast , Mr. Podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight .
The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet .
And there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road .
Here in the cool darkness Mr. Podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight .
Where was the driver now ? ?
Mr. Podger smiled .
For a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama .
Then there had been the auction itself .
Mr. Podger heard again ; ;
at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr. Podger's hammock purchase .
`` We got one at home .

The two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation .
The schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , `` so why not now '' .
It was part of a citywide move toward full integration .
A driver cruising easily at 70 m.p.h. in Lane A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead .
This could never happen in my native Chicago .
This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to Southern California drivers .
During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street .

( The `` autistic '' child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self .
Some people believe she did .
A mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties .
She wrote :
He wants me to do everything for him .
This is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance , my children and I .
Parents have to find other ways of comforting him .
As he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his `` magic '' thing ) .
Only ingenuity will uncover it .

California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers' backyards .
Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate .
Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every `` volunteer '' Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the Aj .
But the rest of the GOP gubernatorial aspirants don't worry him very much .
state and county committeemen , CDC directors and representatives , members of 16 area clubs , and `` all residents '' have been invited .

If the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the Social Security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to GOP hopes in the cities .
But it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John F. Kennedy .
After the Griffin-Byrd political troup has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative Forum , this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature in history .
It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the `` serious candidates '' .

Bostitch , Inc. is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax .
With our current $3 per hundred tax rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant '' as the best way to meet these problems .
While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth .

It can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come out years later .
But no President ever before referred to his as a `` lousy job '' ( as Walter Trohan recently quoted President Kennedy as doing in conversation with Sen. Barry Goldwater ) .
During his aggressive campaign to win his present position , Mr. Kennedy was vitriolic about this country's `` prestige '' abroad .
What does he think a remark like this `` lousy '' one does to our prestige and morale ? ?
Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time .
Also , many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them .

My son , who has completed two years in engineering school , has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer .
At a rate of $3.22 an hour he is now earning approximately $580 a month .
As a result , your criticism of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the Department of Justice was inaccurate , unwarranted and unfair .
In this letter , Mr. Kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration -- what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments .
Congresswoman Church
-- I concur most heartily with today's letter on the futility of writing to Sen. Dirksen and Sen. Douglas .
When she agrees , you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged .

Escape
Sir -- When the colonies decided upon freedom from England , we insisted , through the Declaration of Independence , that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity .
The people of Katanga had fought for , and obtained , their freedom from the Communist yoke of Antoine Gizenga , and his cohorts .
By political , economic , geographic and natural standards , they were justified in doing so .

Although the wood has been changed to coal , much of it still retains its original cell structure .
Working for peace
While I respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that I would like to question .
war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people .
Are we not late , especially those of us who call ourselves Friends , in doing enough about this lack of understanding ? ?
Civil Defense has far to go and many problems to solve , but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm , flood , accident or even war ? ?
In addition , would not the young female public of Washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash ? ?
He , like most of us , wants to be able to sit , to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors .
Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens .
Let us , like the French , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd .
Two strong dissents from the majority report of the Joint Economic Committee ( May 2 ) by Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy of the Thirties did not work .
I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and the Far East .
It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war .
The fact is that the Italians , French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs .
Soviet Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation .
If the German people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following the example of Austria .
President Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called `` Operation Survival '' which has many facets .
to the editor of the New York Times :
It is up to the Assembly to take action against them .
In your Sept. 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress you referred to the lack of `` consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril '' .
Yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country's domestic jurisdiction reservation to its Adherence to the Statute of the International Court of Justice .
Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the United States , it also prevents us from using the court effectively .

Some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration , the Daily Prayer and Three Minutes A Day , as being very helpful .

to the editor of the Inquirer :
To our everlasting shame , we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Having led the world in this mad race I pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race .
Just because Cheddi Jagan , new boss of British Guiana , was educated in the United States is no reason to think he isn't a Red .
Intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on Japan , London or Pearl Harbor .
Belated tribute
At Khrushchev's door , therefore , can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated .
P.S. .
to the editor of the Inquirer :
One of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea .
Bridges , tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings .
We should avoid these congestion points or , putting it another way , keep cars starting and ending on the East side of the river -- on the East side .

Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges .
The matter may seem a small thing to some people , I know , but it's a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism The Commission has posted signs in Washington Square saying :
If birds don't belong in a Square or Park , what does ? ?
but the Commission does not share such sentiments .
The City Government is not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives .
One means to help the birds occurs to me : Let the chimes that ring over Washington Square twice daily , discontinue any piece of music but one .
When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right , when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination , when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation , when we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war , and when we realize that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom , then , and only then will we no longer be `` soft '' .
America doesn't need to `` push-up '' , she needs to stand up ! !
I must , in fairness , take issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals .
A sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute .
Escalation is their first love and their last ; ;
Capable as their minds may be in some directions , these guardians of the nation's security are incapable of learning , or even of observing .
But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly .
They are leaving so fast that the president of the West German Employers' Federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six months' front-line work in factories in West Berlin .
The materials for compromise are at hand : The Nation , Walter Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again and again .
In 1899 , Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster , facing Whitehall and there , presumably , he still stands .
The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable .
Who but Nikita himself ? ?
If some future Khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor , would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession ? ?
The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary General -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .
In all the bitter in-fighting , the squabbles over election procedures , the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries' theme , the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat .
no precedents have been set as yet ; ;
The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means .
The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; ;
The annual butchery of 40,000 American men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive ; ;
True , the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , `` Home-keeping hearts are happiest '' , is as disreputable as Socinianism .
Somehow our contemporary Moloch must be induced to see reason .
As it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body ; ;
So , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the West were so quick to assume when Mr. Khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat .
On October 19 , after the Soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices , Ambassador Stevenson warned the UN General Assembly that this country , in `` self protection '' , might have to resume above-ground tests .
More recently , the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg , `` admitted '' to a news conference in Las Vegas , Nevada , that the US might fall behind Russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain .
The damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects .
Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing .
So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague .
Things aren't that simple anymore .
How much fallout will we get ? ?
The third choice , negotiation , presupposes , as Russian behavior demonstrates , a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable .
Recent statements by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have , to the contrary , assured us that our lead is very great .
The refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start .
But as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became known , there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides .
Far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the Pontiff believes that a revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible light .
The establishment , by the Holy Father , of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern .
The Eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received .
And yet Mr. Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of `` tightening up '' and `` economizing '' .
We wish the President would remember that `` fiscal responsibility '' was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election .
Ethics and peace
Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question .
I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy .
He says that if he were to express to you , once again , his own profound determination to go to the Mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant .
Relative military manpower ? ?
The immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed : a despot does not economize on his generals .
But there must be a catalytic pressure .
Tibet has historically served China as a buffer state .
A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr. Kennedy's views on the world struggle .
New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones .
The controlling pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis of November 1956 .
It reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality : in Cuba last spring ( with which the Dominican events of last month should be paired ) ; ;
right now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana .
It makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue .
There is even some question whether the U.S. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left .
No matter that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo .
)
The Suez-Hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new Administration , but only made more consistent and more active .
Most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa , Katanga and Ghana , as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia , Africa and Latin America .
And it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the Left .
Broadway
Clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- A Taste Of Honey , by Britain's young ( 19 when she wrote it ) Shelagh Delaney ; ;
Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad .
But that explanation is only partly true .

Their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd Street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis .

This is done at varying speeds , ranging from the slow and fast Shifte Telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic Karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ) .
As the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins , the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly .
This state of unawareness may not last much longer .
For a while his work was influenced deeply by the French impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of Gustav Klimt , then the dean of Austrian art .
For years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in Vienna's gutters .
Drafted into the Austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a Vienna billet , went on painting .
Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly ; ;
The effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov & Co. , has shifted the whole attention of the world , including that of the Soviet people , from the `` epoch-making '' twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese conflict .
The big question is whether , in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet solidarity , the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev -- or get rid of Enver Hoxa .
These seem about the only two ways in which the `` unhappy incident '' can now be closed .
Khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to `` peaceful coexistence '' and would like , above all , the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully ; ;
but if he is up against China's crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life .
The next days may show where things stand .
The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment .
What we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate .
I disagree with Mr. Burnham's position on the Common Market ( Nov. 18 ) as a desirable organization for us to join .
Referring to Britain , he says , `` We see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy , placing this authority in Continental hands '' .
We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need .
But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community or `` economic empire '' , but merely what libertarians like Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises have been arguing for years : an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry .
Create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we'll compete with anyone , Europe and Asia combined .
In short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about European competition or Communism either .

The possibility of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys .
If the UN troops are not mercenaries then the Hessians were not mercenaries either .
And if the foreigners fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries then Lafayette and Von Steuben were mercenaries too , as were also the members of the Lafayette Escadrille in the early part of World War 1 , and of Chennault's Flying Tigers in the early days of World War 2 .
It's an eighteenth-century negative , man ! !

I know of no other solution than the one N.C. proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us , hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place .
I feel that N.C. hit the very core of our existence in the editorial `` Confrontation '' .
I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands .
N.C.'s editorial `` Confrontation '' is a stunning piece of writing .

Southern California blackout
I would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President Kennedy's activities , so far as Southern California is concerned .
You have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions .
Even then , a few of the `` less interesting '' questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator .
The radio stations did run `` transcripts '' ( I thought ) during the evening hours .
However , by comparing the TV snatches , two different radio station re-runs , and the censored Los Angeles Times version , I found that the radio stations had edited out questions ( ABC removed the one regarding Laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President's answer .
It also happened with the Inauguration , which was not re-run at all during the evening hours , and I wrote to the TV editor of the Times .
I was interested in James Webb Young's Madison Avenue column in which he raised the question : `` Do We Need a College of Propaganda '' ? ?
During the war , we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare , which included the teaching of propaganda , both black and white and the various shades of grey in between .
When the end did come , and the schools were disbanded and abandoned , we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust .
Representatives of Harvard University Press , which is publishing the book this month of April , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date .
It calls the conclusion admitted valid by `` historians and military strategists alike '' a `` perverted conclusion .
Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune , for it demands transluscent textures , buoyant rhythms , and astringent wit .
Bayreuth next summer
The Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland Wagner , who is doing all the operas this time , and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch .
Sawalisch also conducts `` The Flying Dutch '' , opening July 24 .
But barring a miracle , and don't hold your breath for it , Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov Ballet , which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world .
The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in McCormick Place , which Sol Hurok , ballet booker extraordinary , considers the finest house of its kind in the country -- and of course he doesn't weep at the capacity , either .
Well , Dietrich won't budge from McCormick Place .
Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium ? ?
In the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget , the Dallas Civic Opera will use San Francisco's new Leni Bauer-Ecsy production of `` Lucia Di Lammermoor '' this season , returning the favor next season when San Francisco uses the Dallas `` Don Giovanni '' , designed by Franco Zeffirelli .

One of the local callers , a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling's tales of India , does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds .
Nikolai Cherkasov , the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible , performs the lanky Don Quixote , and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man .
True , the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half , before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court .
The program came out of the NBC Special Projects department , and was slotted in the Du Pont Show Of The Week series .
The jazz buff could hardly ask for more .
`` Chicago And All That Jazz '' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer .
She topped the sextet brilliantly .
Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : A much more girlish Lucia , a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing , and an actress immersed in her role .
Complete with crowd effects , interruptions by jet planes , and sundry other touches of realism , this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect .
Directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time ; ;
These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record .

Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact , impeccably so .
The storyline , in sort , is wildly unrealistic .
The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so that for the first half of the program , when the piano was partially open , Mr. Jenni's playing was too loud .
He made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance .
She played with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures .
Miss Xydis' earlier selections were Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses , in which each variation was nicely set off from the others ; ;
And the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written .
The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is , of course , the Field Marshal himself .
But it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action .

An unsuccessful playwright and actor , he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists .
But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten .
There is a fine second act , as an example , one in which Samuel Groom , as Dillon , has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another .

Loew's theater presents `` Where The Boys Are '' , an MGM picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells .
Dolores Hart , is charming in a leading role , and quite believable .
The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux , but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers , just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases , I suppose this was the attitude the part called for .
The second feature , `` The Price Of Silence '' , is a British detective story that will talk your head off .
Writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer -- `` Glorious old Palmer '' , as he addresses him -- James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce , Santayana , Palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems are `` so many religions , ways of fronting life , and worth fighting for '' , then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe .

The collected works of James Thurber , now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy knows .

`` One of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and out of bed .
But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were on the loose and in those days Low struck like lightning .

One item in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength .
dashed hope
He also speaks of Franklin D. Roosevelt's `` puerile '' assumption that `` if only he ( Stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F.D.R. himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged '' .
The first of these involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government in March , 1917 ; ;
The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda ; ;
Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected .
`` Behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lay a statesman of no mean qualities : Shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed -- like Stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess : The ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word '' .
The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western relations is vitally important , and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator .

So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told .
You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means .
His matchmaking is , naturally , incidental , and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony .
Joan Fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not , plays Ellen , and sings the role very well , too .

Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters , but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining .

Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian interregnum , the practice of singing together -- choruses , catches and glees -- always flourished .
As a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the English madrigal .
Naturally , Mr. Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen : William Byrd , Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins .
There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture .

Mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .
The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith '' .
In fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed .
By analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .

Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead .
But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope , at least on the Catholic side .
Since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit , my Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman Catholic cleric .
According to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England , the `` total of confirmed members is 9,748,000 , but only 2,887,671 are registered on the parochial church rolls '' , and `` over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church of England , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' .
While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period , and that religious population shifts have emptied churches , a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going to church .
Intercede for our separated brethren , that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd , the vicar of thy Son .
'' A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is `` Faith Of Our Fathers '' , which glories in England's ancient faith that endured persecution , and which proclaims : `` Faith of our Fathers : Mary's prayers Shall win our country back to thee '' .
In this connection , it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics , priests and laity , in England , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism , is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics , especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good .
Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs .
Now , not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford , but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-Catholic members of the University .
Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen .
Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human history and human death , coming as the head of a new humanity .
From God's Will and Wisdom , and from virgin earth .
The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words : `` So God created man in his own image ; ;
in the similitude of God he created him '' .
Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ; ;
for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .
Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows :
`` So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .
And He laid down for him certain conditions : so that , if he kept the command of God , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal ; ;
These conditions man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; ;
yet he did not stop being human as a result .
There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ) .
so also did Mary , having a man betrothed ( to her ) , and being nevertheless a virgin , by yielding obedience , become the cause of salvation , both to herself and the whole human race '' .
His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary .
Man's life , originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God , must now be conformed to the shape of death .
But He set a bound to his ( state of ) sin , by interposing death , and thus causing sin to cease , putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh , which should take place in the earth , so that man , ceasing at length to live in sin , and dying to it , might live to God '' .
Death reminds man of his sin , but it reminds him also of his transience .
Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether Adam's life was intended to be part of the process of time .
Furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes .
We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .
Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association , while it may plead that Dr. N. L. Frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` The difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity ; ;
the difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity '' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker .
Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think '' .
Parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents .
It is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine at eleven A.M. on the third of August , A.D. 32 .
We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .
So we are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass on , happily forgetting both him and the entire episode .
The next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly `` science '' , and I submitted to its conditions according to Christ's invitation and promise that , `` If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself '' ( John 7 : 17 ) .

But , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century A.D. , when an Arabic scholar , Tabit Ibn Korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three .
However , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of Orthodox Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 .
After all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the Lo Shu , which was already semisecret anyhow .
All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the Center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 B.C. , also may conceivably have led to the development of the Five-Elements School and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five .
Whereas the primary meanings of the Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought .
Scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in Nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries .
As such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-Han and Han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the Lo Shu ; ;
The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty , when the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-Yang and Five-Elements School , which was traditionally founded by Tsou Yen .
Thus the middle number , 5 , represented Sung-Shan in Honan , Central China ; ;
These fatalities are dramatic evidence of `` halfway evangelism '' , a failure to follow through .
This is not a social call .

the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the Church .
It can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay .
Very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive .
But this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life .
If the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way .
Interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries .
Approached creatively , it is a high art .
As an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area : relations between Christians and non-Christians in these lands .
Colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for Christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other .
Actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture .
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes .
It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-Christian sentiment .
1 .
The American Constitution was historic at this point in providing that `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' .
That mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed .
I do not mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in Hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit .
Leslie Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council of Churches when he says , `` We must claim absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it '' .
When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to `` permit '' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean .
I mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by `` permit '' .
Above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction .
He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i.e. , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by Russia within a few years .
Thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ; ;
Several of the replies to Mr. Toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .
`` I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design .
`` If Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , I think he is right .
I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war '' .
Even Professor Arnold Toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms : `` Compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils .
But one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .
it is to stride along the steep slope downward .
The only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war ; ;
and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race .
Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders .
( 1 ) Most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .
There is some reality to this ; ;
`` Against the grain of creation ''
As far as they were aware , the Connecticut Association of Real Estate Boards had not officially opposed the bill's passage or lobbied in its support .
( This has not been the case everywhere .
Such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses .
Religion , or the lack of it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed .
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook .

water is Af and the H stands for hydrogen ; ;
With just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years .
Then think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come .
and I asked myself a question : Suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover ? ?
Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; ;
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia .
I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at this rate , so I decided to take another measure -- the whole state of Pennsylvania .
then we have sextillion peas .
A speck -- and space
Then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football field inside .
And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs .
it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic energy .
And since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too .
At any rate , it shows us how immaterial we are .
And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music .
Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living .
Many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse .
At best only an approximation could be arrived at .
By the end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour .
The American dream
The ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the older stock .
O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears .
We must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them Melville , Hawthorne , and Henry James the elder , all of them out of a Christian background .
Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .
Some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose .
Garrison , Massachusetts born of Nova Scotian parentage , was by temperament and conviction a reformer .
A strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , Charles Stewart , another Finney convert , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause .
The majority then went to the infant Oberlin .
Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power .
The common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything .
The dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control .
It was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .
After this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced into China , it underwent extensive changes .
To the Confucian , `` virtue '' simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones .
This , in brief , was the historical background out of which Zen emerged .
The truth -- the Eternal Truth -- is not transmittable by words .
But this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers .
As the Zen literature reveals , as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was called out into the world to exercise his powers .
`` Thou mayst have supernatural powers '' , exclaimed Yang Shan , `` yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me '' .
Modern Zen presentation to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the Zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire , action is based on direct self-confidence , and so on .

The American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible .
They recommended , also , that `` at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures '' .
But as the One who called you is holy , be you also holy in all your behavior ; ;
The new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind .
Romans 12 .
You also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins .
Of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth .
Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again of water ( symbol of the Word of God , see Ephesians 26 ) and the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God .
If we are born of God we do not practice sin as a habit .
) if we are born of god we practice righteousness .
If you know that he ( God ) is just ( righteous ) , know that everyone also who does what is just ( righteous ) has been born of him .
Everyone who loves is born of God , and knows God .
If we are born of God we grow in ( not into , but in ) grace .
But grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .
The new birth is necessary because the spiritual kingdom requires a spiritual nature .
`` Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
Do not wonder that I said to thee , ' You must be born again ' '' .
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of any account .
not as the outcome of works , lest anyone may boast .
He who believes in the Son ( Jesus Christ , the Son of God ) , has everlasting life .
2 St. Peter 1 : 4 .
Christ in you , your hope of glory .
Ephesians 17 .
The means of the new birth
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again .
He was then in man's hands .
It was permitted .
God withheld His wrath .
Finally men arrested Him , gave Him a mock trial , flogged Him , nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth and heaven ; ;
and God allowed it .
You can ignore Him .
You can laugh at His blood-bought salvation , curse His followers , and laugh at hell .
You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose .
He is in your hands -- now .
He has said , `` Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me '' ( Revelation 3:20 : :
Then it will be a `` fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God '' if you have abused Him in your hands .
I am merely a channel for something .
All things are possible to God , but He chooses -- usually -- to work through people .
sometimes not .
Fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women , regardless of creed or color , could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living .
That was nearly 13 years ago .
Today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees .
Throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate for , although I have never offered great financial inducements , talent has found its way to me : William Boal who so ably organizes business operations ; ;
Searching for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not only the country , but the whole world .

Rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel Castro was on his way to Havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought Batista for five years .
yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips .
Within a week , however , I began to suspect that something was wrong .
New schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation : any academic degree earned during Batista's regime was invalid .
I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon .

Therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! !
This happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada -- Henri De Courcy .
Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments .
That's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal .
Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight .
Well , sir they did real great ! !
As you can see , in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! !
The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell Bent-Arm Pullover .
This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved .
This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests ; ;
The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles .
It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders ; ;
It improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed .

It increases flexibility of the legs .
After you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner .
Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .
It's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them .
I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body .
If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate .
Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby .
When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board .
In addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea .
now we must use a heavy one .
Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool .
These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring .
It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ; ;
it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like .
It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits .
Good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited .
The tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard .
A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets .
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ?
One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing .
Because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability .
The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile .
But , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ?
Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease .
We could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters .
If , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one .
With powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built .
If our SAC bombers were , today , capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance .
We would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force -- whether it were fixed or mobile .
Our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance .
In a few years we will have SAMOS ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) .
Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) .
But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student's approach as distinctly his own .
Turning to the more modern versions , Curzon's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work .
Some of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky , however .
( Special compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp : his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance .
It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort .
Helmut Roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists .
Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .
Since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold .
Yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall .
Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation .
In the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings .
The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration .
It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener .
At the Westminster KC Dog Show in Madison Square Garden , New York on the second day , the Finals of the Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class .
It was interesting to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class .
Dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ! !
`` Take away your attitude '' , said Mrs. Long , `` and what have you left ? ?
And may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come '' ! !
This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ! !
Anne Hone Rogers judges 28th finals
Juniors competed last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club , recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this Class -- the Finals for the year .
It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered .
Betty Lou Ham , age 16 , Holyoke , Mass. , showing an Irish Setter , was chosen as International Champion of the year .
From the records we keep -- Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in both United States and Canada .
We suggested this Class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows .
Juniors who attend this Chicago show should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help to them .
The founder of the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby , Sr. ( for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster ) was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division .
By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners .
My husband enters the motel office , signs up for a room , and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets .
Once settled , we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot , keep them under control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture .
Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .
Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water .
Arriving at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun .
This year , Americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation's national , regional and local boat shows .
You may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose .
I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , Americans excel over any country in the world in the long run .
Russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor , for instance .
These engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage .
Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower .
What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line .
Ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land ; ;
These can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets .
The number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented .
Here's how the scheme works : Suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal .
This also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars .
There are other basic rules .
A turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points .
The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars .
As an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the `` distant '' signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant .
In other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects .
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish .
There should be 10'' '' between the two parallel members and each should be 1'' '' from an end of the long piece .
Drill all No. 50 and counter-drill all except the `` A '' pieces size 43 .
Drill two No. 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2-56 .
Locate the position from Fig. 7 .
Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4'' '' tappet movement .
Drill a No. 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end .
To each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a Af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs. 6 and 8 .
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting .
All the bars are cut from Af brass .
Chuck a 2'' '' or 3'' '' piece of 1/8'' '' dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool .
This tool can also be made with a lathe .
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem .
The equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .
They indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition .
The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .
The symbol for multiplication is `` **b '' .
Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order .
For use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents .
The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places .
Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .
The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events .
To arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right .
The different steps will look like this : Af
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid .
The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms .
The total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume '' .
After the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula : Af
This is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft .
Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics .
To determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is : Af .

As a Christmas service , I've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models .
For me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design .
these are fairly large , tough animals .
We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments : Three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group .
Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire .
it's much too explosive for small edible game .
Hunting rifles , '61
The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models , actions and calibers .
Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the

You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with
shotshells -- to break the little Targo clay targets .
A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets .
Presently , the 742C is available in Af .
The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 Deluxe ( under $135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design .
Because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model .
Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock .
The Supermatic Trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto .
Either model is a very good dollar value .

He had two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving .
They did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco .
They advertised harness polish , liniments , Ball's Rubber Boots , Green River Whiskey , Hood's Sarsaparilla , patent medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco .

Dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets .
The recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote down in his ledger , is basically this :
Set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg .

Even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents .
About a thousand years after that , when the Roman Empire was divided , it became capital of the Eastern section .

This one was set up here in 390 A.D. on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them .
Beyond it I noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the Serpentine Column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi , Greece .
Near the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes .
Called the Marmara Gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing the way there , and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara .

Roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions .
Allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) .
Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold .

But each step has been broken down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman .
Wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting .

Don't worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain ; ;
The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired .
The filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full Af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage .
Note : If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in Af , Af , and Af can be used in making the glass panels .

This document began : `` No. 1 Newbury Port , may 30th , 1791
`` We , the Subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this , or a similar Writing , We will present a petition to the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge , and a Right to demand a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge , and on like Terms , and if such an Act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times and in such Manners , as by the said proposed Corporation , shall be directed and required '' .
He says of it :
`` It consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore .
As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature ; ;
and , although he later explained that he was talking French , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening .
It stood in its original form until 1882 .
In 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge .
`` .
Information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport , Mass. has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge , in the states of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont , Rhode Island , and Connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges .
`` Approved , Timothy Palmer ''
He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction ; ;
During the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior .
On the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose .
Where to put it
You are likely to be nearer the truth .
You can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude .
Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed .
It may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs .
Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled .
Had we taken a lien on a state park ? ?
From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks .
Naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool '' were both unexpected and unsettling .
After the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result .
First and foremost : No one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle .
Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times .
No bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run .
When you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent .
Of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) .
Preserving the pool
Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry .
Once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present .
Its upkeep ? ?
Clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words .
It will improve your disposition .
You can get year-'round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow .
The cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet .
For cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water .
Now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees .
You can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone .
You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower .
A 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 BTU to well over 10,000 Aj .
Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough .
Money-saving tips .
If the house you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings .
Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can .
You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ;
you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed .
It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site .
These are a great aid for planning use back at the office .
How much study is required ? ?
Check the quality of the water .
A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site .
The fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest .
This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions .
-- The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there .
The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection .

These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 , era .
Some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical .
we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches ; ;
In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose .
How right he was ; ;
how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism .
And with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music .
The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; ;
the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens .
I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words : `` the clarity must be new , not old '' .
In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments .

choruses , chamber music ensembles ; ;
and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music .
Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures .
In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint .
What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form ; ;
Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done .
Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness .
After selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water .

The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery .
Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation .
A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-TV system to view the results .
These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; ;
) This is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-TV system which preceded the present simultaneous system .
At the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .
This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing .
In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other .
Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position .
From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail .
A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques .
In addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique .
Battery life limited the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .
A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs. Zworykin and Farrar and Mr. Berkely of the Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute .
As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc. bursts .
These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained .
Various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water .
Because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels .
Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals .
Based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through '' human organs .
As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center .

From Gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism .
With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized mind .
Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden '' jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile .

Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge .
Problems in the market
Market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts .
The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted .
In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade .
Salesmanship is still necessary , but it's a different brand of salesmanship .
The use of bulk handling is continuously growing .
Higher costs of advertising and promotion .
How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ?
Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ?
who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; ;
and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ?
We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn't make up its mind .
Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? ?
The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities .
He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings '' .
And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .
It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise .
It is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior design demands .
In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use .
This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands .
Long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence .
No one can deny that these `` back door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .
Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design .
This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer .
The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .
Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed .
How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program ? ?

A program to fit your needs
Too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant .
How old is your working force ? ?
You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions .
Check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you .

The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life .
Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education .
Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? ?
With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now .
The National Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure .
They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding .
There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds .
But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy .
Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of the tip money .
Today's campers want comforts , and they have them .
Neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .

This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology .
The old shop adage still holds : `` A good mechanic is usually a bad boss '' .
He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside ; ;
there is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward .
Further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path .
Westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side : consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist .
One company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels .
There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks ; ;
`` We do not have people in our organization termed ' consultants ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject .
`` Above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of Engrg , R & Aj .
Top job : research scientist
`` .
The primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society .
With no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance .
`` We have two approaches for the technical man : the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager ; ;
This function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff .
Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' .
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State .
Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City .
Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter .
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y. .
Its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue .
Called a `` Slo-Flo '' meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles , a key individual being Don Nelson .
Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states .
In working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally .
It is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example .
To overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines .
The Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .
He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .
What does Tri-State actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for '' stage ? ?
It may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities .

and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc. , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics .

Signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters .
Here are some of the newer items currently available :
Poster Products Inc. , Chicago , Ill. : a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock .
Large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations .
Also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material .
Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft. , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters .
Finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in. aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces .

The revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier .
`` That House & Home Round Table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling '' , says Clarence Thompson , long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' Research Council .
`` It made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling .
There are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it .
Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need .
For some significant new items see the pictures .
`` With a 15,500-lb. fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time '' , says James Wright of Aj .
The railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars .
This costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open .
It cuts the lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading .
Says Wright : `` Our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years .
And most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles '' .
Builder Eddie Carr of Washington , past president of NAHB , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` SCR masonry process '' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the Structural Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less .
The SCR process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day .
We found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don't make two teams ; ;

New rule no. 5 : :
Don't waste any $.10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $.03 a stud
This is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit .
dry studs cost less than $.03 more .
With few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at dockside , airport , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , oftentimes at no additional cost .
If you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3.00 .
As in the United States , there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven , and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week .
It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days .
It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $.80 to $.90 for the equivalent of a United States gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford , Chevrolet or even a Cadillac , which are available in some countries , it is probably wiser to choose the smaller European makes which average thirty , thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon .
All model cars are not available in all countries .
Quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country .
The same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven .
Rates for American cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible , but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models .
There is a fairly wide selection of models of English , German and French manufacture from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7 , Citroen 2 CV , Volkswagens , Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca Beaulieu .
Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in Europe , but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory .
The big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven , being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed .
Since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine .
The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars .
Aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts , especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on .
The way MacArthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this : Af Primary stresses on emeralds and wish ; ;
note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness .
And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .
It was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the `` culture shock '' they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the `` norms of human communication '' .
Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level .

If anyone thought of the John Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried .
It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront .
Some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first .

Thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at Bari .

Emerson , in his lecture , refers to the `` startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight , that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room , and heard precisely this dialogue , at some former hour , they know not when '' .
Occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .
Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams , enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts .
However , readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams , should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter 1 : :
The question becomes , `` What is a dream '' ? ?
Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .
He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite , and imagined it must have been German or English .
But , in denying any physical reality for this dream , how could the brain possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout , violent break or sudden substitution ? ?
That the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor's brain , or 2 .
The degree of circumstance , the ratio of memory to forgetfulness , determines whether a dream will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision , or the vaguely , effective source of the weird deja vue feeling .
After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt .
He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before , and he had something to prove he had .
In this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school .
Where a growing season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject to erosion , many farmers fail .
Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat .
All these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year .

( He'd get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover .
Often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the Winooski or the White River along the line of the broken railroad .

The mature person is creative .
We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed .
While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .
It is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator .
Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , Victorian past ; ;
Joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women .
Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both .
First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .
One thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act .
More rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration .
In recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention .
This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act .
But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman .
The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological .
The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels .
In fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon .
Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration .
The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it .
The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax .
This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered .
Both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid .
One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .
I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the `` clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism '' , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit .
In a growing number of American homes , marriage counselors report , the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships .
They consider it simply a sign of our times .
`` The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone , medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book , Release From Sexual Tensions .
Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .
And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .
On the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .
This opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists , Dr. Maurice E. Linden , director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health .
`` When the roles of husband and wife are reversed , so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the effects on their whole relationship , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' .
Caught at last , he was sentenced to prison .
While he was in custody his wife divorced him .
Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .
More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .
The wife's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .
They aren't `` frigid '' and they aren't homosexual ; ;
`` Grandma wasn't expected to like it '' , Dr. Marion Hilliard , the late Toronto gynecologist , once summed up the attitude of the '90s .
When did women begin to assert themselves sexually ? ?
She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .
`` Very few wives '' , says Dr. Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .
Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .
According to Dr. Ellis , the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .
Not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .
If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .
In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple's own affair , and can't always be measured by a general yardstick .
He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' '' .
Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute .
And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 , `` Diane Harris Graham , 30 , D.O.A. , circumstances -- unusual '' .
Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as `` the Golden Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial '' .
Diane was needed as a material witness in the case and New York police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel , of course .
`` In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County .
Diane sobbingly denied this to the court .
`` That's a lie .
An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as `` Mr. Warfield , the famous producer '' .
In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her .
No one ever learned what happened to the Greek .
It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night .
Discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental .
She thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in Rome , she met Pulley Bey , a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt .
`` It was a strange relationship .
Diane spoke no Italian or French .
She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet .
No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see Farouk .
She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her .
When Farouk was overthrown , police picked up his personal pimp , Pulley Bey .
Officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the United States .
With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York .
She later divorced Graham , who is believed to have moved to Bolivia .
He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time .
The blonde's nude body was in bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her .
She was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens .
At least she never knew what the bottom was like '' .
As he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body , Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo .
`` Cancer '' ! !
When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules , Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain .
Leaving Lee's office , Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician , who treated her for burned tissue .
Not only do these quacks assume impressive titles , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence .
Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually .
She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized .
Mr. A has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man .
`` That's a lot of hard-earned money to lose '' , he says today .
But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering .
Carroll diagnosed Mrs. Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic '' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) .
Inevitably , Mrs. Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis , weighing 60 pounds .
Moreover , her husband and child contracted T.B. from her .
Who are the victims of the device quacks ? ?
The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like Mr. A. , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor Fraud's avarice .
One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth .

Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value .
It is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious , and the medium has to translate these into meaning .
If communication with an entity on the `` other side '' is taking place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism .

Where schools , fire and police protection , and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country , real estate taxes are usually about the same .
A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably .

And if it was not an individual who was in the dock , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a `` fiend '' ? ?
In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument .
If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ?
The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government .
Wasn't this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries worth highlighting ? ?
The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level .
Instead of Catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring , as many Non-Catholics imagine , the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed .
These are substantially the same factors considered by Non-Catholics in family planning .
The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period .
The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them .
Why is it so different in regard to birth control ? ?
Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past .
the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control '' .
Since then , many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty .
What determines the morality , they state , is not the means used , but the motive In general , the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .
The general board declared : `` Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .
For all concerned with social-welfare legislation , the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear , profound and far-reaching .
Only confusion , failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin .
Seventeen months later , on September 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay .
The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .
The name : Henry Hudson .
He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .
A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies .
He named this opening , between Baffin Island and Labrador , the `` Furious Overfall '' .
On the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case .
Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .
( The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage .
For the first three weeks , the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain , then turned westward .
Fog hung over the route constantly .
Patiently , he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives .
One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in England .
The statement was effective .
The meeting broke up .
Hudson was free to sail on .
The men were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking .
The important result , however , was that Juet and Francis Clemens , the deposed boatswain , became Hudson's sworn enemies .
Seven hundred miles south of York Factory , at `` the Forks '' of the Red and the Assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812 .
The latter , members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812 , had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815 .
It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward .
When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots , Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river .
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .
For many years the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie Du Chien on the Mississippi River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul , Minnesota .
On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River , Robert Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .
His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts .
During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England .
This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements .
Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie Du Chien , until then the most advanced United States post .
'' Despite Company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village .
On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi .
By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States .
Its people , including Pierre Bottineau and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry , were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840 .
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor .
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : `` they moved about from corner to corner , as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god '' .
Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels '' ; ;
A Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864 : :
I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes , but we take no notice of them now '' .
Just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every time '' .
Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners' families .

Its folklore and legend , usually disguised as history , are allowed to account for group actions , to provide a focal point for group loyalty , and to become a cohesive force for national identification .
Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street .
Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution .
It has come to mean myths , legends , tales , songs , proverbs , riddles , superstitions , rhymes and such literary forms of expression .
For that matter , the experts themselves are a mixed breed .
They have little `` esprit de corps '' .
His standards are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst .
Publishers want books that will sell , recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music , grade and high schools want quaint , but moral , material .
If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work , the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public .
Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ?
Is the writer propagandistic ? ?
As part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade .
He had a round , frank Irish face , creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone's body .
He carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket , one under his left armpit , one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands .
He was an expert florist , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths .
He was also at this time , although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone , the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld , the roughneck king .
The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements among the bawdy houses , honkytonks , and sawdust saloons of his birthplace ; ;
He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary , later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac , but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor .
O'Banion's first conflict with the police came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary ; ;
Unlike the Sicilians , he additionally conducted holdups , robberies , and safe-cracking expeditions , and refused to touch prostitution .
Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic .
The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West .
The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time .
It included the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes .
When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers .
However , this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever .
The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates .
At the end of the performance , Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters .
he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested .
But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman .
O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal .
Here was stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky .
In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ; ;
While a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour .
They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height , but when they pour into a V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions .
Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell , not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers .
When a second quake came , they dashed back to the beach , fearing that they might be buried under landslides .
Just as they reached the shore , the first huge wave crashed upon them .
The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ) , and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over .
The waves may keep coming for many hours .
The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet .
Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude .
They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor , knocked down telephone lines , marooned automobiles , flooded lawns , killed six cows .
There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage .
The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized , even overemphasized .
Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports .
( 2 ) If earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? ?
In the search for oil and gas , we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources .
Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment , `` The Fighting Seventh '' .
First of all , no unit likes to have a new CO brought in from the outside , especially when he's an armchair trooper .
There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .
For example , it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn .
Maneuvers over , the 7th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo , Captain Chandler still with them .
He set out to keep Troop H the best troop in the best regiment .
Carroll was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition for that RA berth , and he wanted to play it cool .
Just a month after the Korean War broke out , the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines , ready for combat .
From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea .
The regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side .
He assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .
One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll , the young officer bucking for the Regular Army .
His followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill , firing as they ran .
They found it at the junction between Troops H and G , and prepared to counterattack .
He turned to his platoon .
`` Okay , men '' , he said .
`` Follow me '' .
That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun .
Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade , he lived .
He finished the war as a major general , commanding a full division , and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the U.S. Army .
This brings us squarely to the problem of power , and the uses a nation makes of power .
The first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power .
Suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the Soviets' position : `` There would be more than 2,000 modern Soviet fighters , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean .
But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .
The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .
Communist gains
In answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests .
Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence .
Today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist ; ;
Indonesia , in the early days of the Republic , leaned toward the West .
There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned , but did nothing about .
And contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures '' and `` world opinion '' to bring down that Communist government ; ;
`` Sounds exactly like last time '' .
The young man spoke steadily enough , but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven .
Then the lights went out .
`` Please '' , she said , `` please '' .
They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages , with an average of 200 souls .
Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are .
and to live in harmony with nature '' .
Even life in harmony with death .
The Royal Lao Army , on the other hand , was paid and equipped with American funds .
To find out , we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled , in the daytime at least , by the Royal Lao Army : from Attopeu , the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast , to Muong Sing , the City of Lions in the northwest , close to Communist China ( map , page 250 ) .
We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts , all four wheels spinning uselessly .
Boun My , our interpreter ; ;
Boun My -- the name means one who has a boun , a celebration , and is therefore lucky -- was born in Savannakhet , the Border of Paradise .
He had attended three universities in the United States .
We were told that to the Pathet Lao , a kidnaped American was worth at least $750 , a fortune in Laos .
Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort .
Prince wears ten-gallon hat
With our company of soldiers , we made one long column of reddish dust .
Then we drove on , until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields , bouncing across their squat earth walls .
But our two Jeep mates -- Keo Viphakone from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver , Pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust .
That way they have an infirmary for $400 .
Mr. Keo agreed .
`` Our people have been used to accepting things as they found them '' , he said .
Then we were off again .
We did it for three days .
But our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery .
Then , one after another , the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists .
`` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive '' , a boy remarked .
`` It means that you have to get ahead '' .
`` I like the tradition '' , a girl said .
Another teen-ager remarked : `` Most Jews don't believe in God , but they believe in people -- in helping people '' .
The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ; ;
One of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented .
One of the significant developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women .
In upper teen Jewish life , the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality .
`` People automatically assume that I'm in college '' , a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably .
She is even prone to regard the college girl as immature .
The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically .
One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town .
At the same time , there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates .
For most Brooklyn College students , college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family .
It's so much trouble , I don't usually bother '' .
First , the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights .
The great world beyond beckons .
But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- Fire Island , Nantucket , Westhampton , Long Island , for example -- tend to be homogeneously Jewish .
For galled breasts , the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste .
This could also be used for any other skin irritation .
at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection , one for hastening delayed menstruation .
Another swore by vinegar baths for burns , and still another recommended salted butter .
This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil ; ;
when it was cool , the fat was skimmed off and bottled .
Cow's milk was another cure for burns , and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly .
A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings , which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the `` heat '' .
His brother ran a mile to get the father ; ;
Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding , and rue was an antiseptic .
One family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips , or , if these were not handy , plain lard .
While nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose , not long ago a nosebleed was simply that , and treatment had little variation .
This might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck , pressed on the upper lip , or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ) .
Bed slats were washed in alum water , legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene , and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate , applied with a feather .
A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment , but it did the job .
Shingles were cured by gentian , an old drug , used in combinations .
They drank half a cup of this morning and night , and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution .
Frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow .
Another frequent pioneer difficulty , caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots , was corns .
Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days .
another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily .
Sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub ; ;
This does give relief , as I can testify .
In instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity , the situation is ideal .
And certainly , in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker , the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown .
Consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- `` steering ever from the known to the unknown '' -- are the requisites .
A really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the Visigoths .
It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days , but in terms of months and years it is fatal .
Wine stored for a long time should be on its side ; ;
White wines should be opened when served , having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness .
a Pouilly-Fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold .
Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine , especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive .
This does not mean , though , that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day , after they have once been opened , are never as good .
By tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well .
Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine , lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table , without disturbing the sediment .
The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted .
Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer ; ;
They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and Louisiana law required their removal from the state .
In March there was a division of the slaves , and Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible .
`` I considered that your views would be best carried out '' , he explained , `` by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation .
If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited .
This cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed .
Thus twenty `` black souls '' were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men .
Despite Giffen's warning , Palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in Louisiana .
Otherwise , freedom would mean removal from the state in which `` as the place of their past residence from birth , or for many years , it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain '' .
On March 11 the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition .
Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier , shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair , and that it would reach the `` Ears of the People on the Plantation , and make them restless & unhappy '' .
When Giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey , Gorham readily assented , vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents , his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him .
In view of these difficulties , Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana .
Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time , and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be allowed to see his family again .
Mrs. Child , who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery , now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before , but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana .
Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas , `` many of whom were coarse & passionate people , much excited by what they heard of my plans '' .
He had a short private talk with each adult slave .
All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season , so that they could get in `` their own little produce '' .
the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account .
Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement `` so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience '' .
Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration .
But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest .
Many of the new appointees are art collectors .
He selected as Comptroller of Defense , not a veteran accountant , but a former Rhodes Scholar , Charles Hitch , who is author of a study on The Economics Of Defense In The Nuclear Age .
Postmaster General J. Edward Day , who must deal with matters of postal censorship , is himself author of a novel , Bartholf Street , albeit one he was obliged to publish at his own expense .
But his credentials are impeccable .
A man of great talent , he will continue to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter , strictly ex officio , for culture .
A more official representative is the Secretary of the Interior .
Udall , who comes from one of the Mormon first-families of Arizona , is a bluff , plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight .
Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk , hewed from the timbers of the British ship H.M.S. Resolute and presented to President Hayes by Queen Victoria .
With its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White House .
Her effort to put the home of living Presidents on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes no party lines .
Secretary and Mrs. Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire furniture , including Dolley Madison's own sofa , to furnish a room in that style .
Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid .
For example , groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River .
Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter , starting with their own front door .
The Lodge , built of hand-hewn virgin spruce , can handle fifty people for dining , sleeping , or lounging in its huge living room .
Under the auspices of the Outing Club , Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club , which takes on tough climbs like Mount McKinley , and Bait & Bullet , whose interests are self-evident , and even sports a Woodman's Team , which competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and chopping , canoe races , and the like .
And on the summit of Mount Washington , where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world , there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas `` because it is there '' .
The legislators decided to `` liberate '' Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms , faculty , and chapel .
A lawyer , hired by the college , was arguing specifically for Dartmouth : Daniel Webster , class of 1801 , made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea .
''
Eleazar Wheelock , a Presbyterian minister , founded the school in 1769 , naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth , its sponsor and benefactor .
Eleazar , pausing on the Hanover plain , found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first College Hall , a log hut dedicated `` for the education & instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading , writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences ; ;
He transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college .
And at his last commencement , in that year , Dr. Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college .
Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates .
It is still a college only and not a university ; ;
However , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the Dartmouth Medical School ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the Thayer School of Engineering , and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration .
It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed .
The person who left the buggy there has never been identified .
It is known that Morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at Westport , a town not far from Fall River .
It is possible that Morse told the woman it was 11:20 , but it could have been earlier , since she did serve dinner on time .
Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door .
He met nobody he knew on this walk .
There is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs. Borden was killed .
Morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room , Mrs. Borden told the servant , `` Bridget , I want you to wash these windows today '' .
Morse's knowledge of what Mrs. Borden told Bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there .
The time would have been shortly after the murder of Mrs. Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior .
Although Pearson disbelieved almost everything Lizzie said , and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did , he happily accepted her statement about Bridget as the whole truth .
Fleet asked the same question about Bridget , and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her .
She told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders , but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner .
She replied , `` I know of one man that has not been friendly with him .
Kirby was , of course , reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders .
The actions of Bridget should be examined , since she was there and opportunity did exist , if only to establish her innocence .
The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a `` big bundle '' of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut .
The people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points , always to the detriment of Lizzie .
Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests .
and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied .
He recalled Lucy , as `` a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond '' .
The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college , and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men .
But even so Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits .
Do you think I might profitably study some of the history you do , perhaps two weeks behind you .
There was another family interest also .
and after 1883 , was professor of astronomy at Brown University .
Winslow , as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall , used to characterize her as `` our iron sister '' .
Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students ; ;
and as graduates gratefully recall , she drew on her purse as well .
Under Miss Upton , the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption .
In 1890 when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss Packard , it was Miss Upton who planned the trip , and `` with rare executive ability '' bore the brunt of `` the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end '' .
Yet they thrived on it .
She noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence ; ;
and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly .
and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia L. Brett of Hamilton , New York , a friend from the early days .
Miss Giles always used to refer to her as `` Sister '' .
The books of the school hold a memorial to her ; ;
Mary J. Packard , states a Messenger editorial , was `` efficient , pains-taking , self-effacing , loving , radiating the spirit of her Master .
The apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis , usually at night , perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school .
Indeed , in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work .
In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation .
Rather we see here another vicious circle .
Second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student's time in those years ; ;
I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls .
In this respect , public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts .
Indeed , one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city , because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs .
He prefers to designate such schools as `` general '' high schools .
One vocational instructor in a city vocational school , speaking of his course in a certain field , said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city .
Peanuts are the world's second most important legume .
We produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed .
Blanched peanuts , as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts , are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off .
In western Europe and North America , where the level of economic development is higher , grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed .
About 90 percent of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals .
The artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages .
Almond oil , another nondrying oil , was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances .
The kernels of brazil nuts , cashews , coconuts , filberts , hazelnuts , hickory nuts , pecans , walnuts , and pine nuts are predominantly oily .
Almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein .
Chestnuts are starchy .

Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists .
Bead tree seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba .
Tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids , aromatic oils , and highly flavored components .
Still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny , dry , seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods , although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible .
The common spices , flavorings , and condiments make up this group .
Cocoa , chocolate , and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree .
World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between Africa ( 63 percent ) and South America ( 27 percent ) .
The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain .

You couldn't stop 'em ; ;
you had to go with 'em or wait till the storm was over , and follow .
Drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds , but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought , or as an aftermath of a stampede .
Drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 'em , and to find shelter for 'emselves .
Followin' such an event there was usually a harvest of `` fallen hides '' , and the ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons .
Cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature 'em into prime beef were said to be `` double wintered '' .
The terminology of the range , in speakin' of `` dry stock '' and `` wet stock '' , was confusin' to the tenderfoot .
To stir cattle up and get 'em heated and excited was to `` mustard the cattle '' , and the act was called `` ginnin' 'em 'round '' , or `` chousin' 'em '' .
It was when she was in this position that the name `` prayin' cow '' was suggested to the cowboy .
A general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers '' .
Such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns , and a thorough `` tailin' '' usually knocked the breath out of a steer , and so dazed 'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day .
When the cowboy used the word `` tailin's '' , he meant stragglers .
Seizin' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin' the bull off balance , and `` bustin' '' 'im with terrific force .
This word was from the Spanish , meanin' `` polecat '' .
Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler .
Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with the uncounted cattle was called a `` range count '' .
This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the `` books won't freeze '' .
His saloon was a meetin' place for influential Wyoming cattlemen , and one year durin' a severe blizzard , when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces , he said , `` Cheer up , boys , whatever happens , the books won't freeze '' .
When a cowhand said that a man had `` good cow sense '' , he meant to pay 'im a high compliment .
`` That's the Colonel '' , he said , `` But I can't see the dogs '' .
Then the heavy roar of a lion .
Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound .
The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks , creepers and bushes , so thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called , Ulyate answered from ten feet away .
The dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John .
`` We've got to get her out of there '' ! !
Loveless , too , objected .
`` It won't work , Colonel '' .
John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood .
`` Careful , now '' , Jones warned .
She charged .
Of course the factor of head start made all the difference .
So : Means edged around on the north side of her , Jones moved in from the south .
Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention .
But Means kept on .
The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives .
Most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .
It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .
Most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .
The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .
The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ .
Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church , in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid .
A little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War .
When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones .
It is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both .
The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs .
It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .
It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world .
The story reflects the way too many people feel .
This was typical of such games , which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship .
Radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home , in the town park or a pasture , with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox .
Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the Three I League , or the Pony League , or the Coastal Plains League , or the fast Eastern League , if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere .
Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams , sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores , that played two or three times a week throughout the summer , usually in the cool of the evening , before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each , or even more , to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over .
A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with Daddy Browning's , Al Capone's , Earl Sande's , and the Prince of Wales' .
or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath .
Promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators , and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance .
We hope thereby to emphasize that , from a psychological standpoint , the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence .
Erikson has noted that , unless this trust developed early , the time ambivalence experienced , in varying degree and temporarily , by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood , while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion .
Some of these mothers , apparently feeling a desperate urgency , made , on the spur of the moment , commitments , in love and sex , that would have life-long consequences .

However , if the child has been constantly surrounded , during nursery and early school age , by peer groups ; ;
Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others ; ;
The comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in Chapter 2 ) ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship .
they accepted a job primarily because it was available , convenient , and paid reasonably .
Not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the Selden suit .
William A. Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence , the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years .
Parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony .
The vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit , as well as the complex character of the automotive art , encouraged both sides to exploit `` every possible chance '' for or against the patent , said Parker .

.
Nevertheless , it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade .
One of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of American industrial cooperation .
In this tangle of conflicting claims , the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the A.L.A.M. at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation .
It was commonplace for auto makers , parts-suppliers , and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail .
Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications .
Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke & Marmon Company , an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904 .
With the other members of the patents committee -- Wilfred C. Leland , Howard E. Coffin , Windsor T. White , and W. H. Vandervoort -- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution .

You will walk some of the narrow , old streets , hemmed in by massive palazzi .
Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo Di Ferro will bring you to the Palazzo Spada , built in 1540 and now occupied by the Council of State .
By tipping the porter , you can see in the courtyard Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective .

There is no way for him not to know it : there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent , accumulating contempt and hatred of a people .
and he asked me in perfect innocence , `` Why don't all the Negroes in the South move North '' ? ?
But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto .
and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a `` turf '' .
I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners , because `` At least there , you haven't got to play any guessing games '' ! !
In the second place , though , even if Birmingham is worse , no doubt Johannesburg , South Africa , beats it by several miles , and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world .
None of this is true for the Northerner .
Neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man .
The country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom .
In the meantime , generations keep being born , bitterness is increased by incompetence , pride , and folly , and the world shrinks around us .
I had intended to be there myself .
One has only , for example , to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions .
The first question is : Would I like to live here ? ?
Now , I do not doubt that , among the people at the U.N. that day , there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives .
Their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity .
Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature .
The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin S. Porter .
So is the time of the novel .
it is also the rate of photographing .
Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative , which is , at its simplest , the story of an action with , usually , a beginning , a middle , and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence .
The `` moving '' picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture of the same subject , but the difference is really one of degree ; ;
A posse is formed and pursues the robbers , who , having made their escape , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out .
The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence , and the cut edge is joined physically , by cement , to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence .
This is what Porter did .
The simple , naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction .
The man was D.W. Griffith .
But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself .
they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents .
Members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; ;
We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; ;
The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations .
Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; ;
Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members .
The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance .
nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development .
This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment .
Negroes , Puerto Ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities .
It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes .
Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers .
Traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them .
Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district .
The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined .
During his first administration , Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country .
He became , after a time , commander of a post on the Alabama River , but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district , and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade .
Venturesome traders , however , continued to come to them from Mobile , and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the French markets .
The savages divided into two factions ; ;
In spite of the company's restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory .
The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts .
The difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families .
In order to compete with English traders , Bienville radically changed the price schedule .
The chances are excellent that he will .

For a few giddy months that coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods , he was the sensation of Washington .
`` Twenty-one '' , replied the sheik .
And how many of these were sons ? ?
The sheik smiled and murmured : `` That is precisely correct '' .
Spiritual life is cultivated , but students do not need to be Christian .
There is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected -- some think too much .
There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools .
It will be painful , but interesting , to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop .
They suggested several new foods , and usually I found them good , except the sweets , which I think I could learn to like .
Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural center .
They were even better than those of Tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative .
After a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji ) , I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day .

They knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret Pearl Harbor , I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan .
This day was `` Open House for Parents '' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables .
Everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun .
It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning .
they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests .
Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could not see , but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant .
The end or aim of the action , of course , is also important , especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights , e.g. , against Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County , Tennessee , at the present moment .
It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian morality , like any other form of resistance .
There may be instances in which , if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all , this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people .
A Southerner married to a New Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes .
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; ;
and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don't count any more in the world of to-day .
I take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ? ?
His assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views .
Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .
I never heard of a poll being taken on the question .
The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .
The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .
their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties .
And therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South .
If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .
In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country .
Had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England , there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain .
Many Northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .
The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives .
As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the `` American way '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .
In the past , the duties of the state , as Sir Henry Maine noted long ago , were only two in number : internal order and external security .
It became the sole `` subject '' of `` international law '' ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by Bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena .
Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally .
The hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition .
If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .
The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .
Almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm .
Historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group .
To him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the English monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i.e. , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations .
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular '' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split .
Nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world .
to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility .
Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks .

Wisman , who has had the chief controller's job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons .
He need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked alert .
Now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets .
They are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages .
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an `` internal authenticator '' , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing .
As Wisman put it , `` They have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie .
Why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? ?
All three must compare notes and agree to `` go '' .
They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow .
Occasionally , for no reason that I could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot .
They ran for three hours .

He knows that the economy of life in the `` outback '' is awful .
`` Damned right '' , he said .

Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .
They were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man , his lubra , and two children .
The Australian and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine .
There were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent .
There was also a boomerang , elaborately carved .
Everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless .
The two children , both boys , wandered around the Australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work .
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .
They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it .
The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city .
In time Isfahan came to be known as `` half the world '' , Isfahan nisf-i-jahan .
the capital went elsewhere ; ;
Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight .
It takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square .
And of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar .
a cigarette would taste particularly good .
For one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed ; ;
The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .
These are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed .
On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge .
All kinds come to walk in the promenade : merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal ; ;
students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns .
Nonetheless , they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks .
It is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .
That , at any rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge .
These songs ( practically all Persian music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves .
The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra , William Steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life .
As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent .
Because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes , he composed his own studies .
Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .
His professional career began when he was twenty ; ;
he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor .
Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera , after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky , teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold .
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and De Falla's La Vida Breve .
The Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber , and the world premiere of Schonberg's Von heute auf morgen .
Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930's , Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community .
Where in Europe was he going now ? ?
Since it is not far from Viareggio , he will visit Puccini's house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme , which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces .
He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia Di Santa Cecilia , as well as concerts in Munich and Cologne .
I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today '' .
Like his late colleague , Mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle .
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature .
One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .
The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears .
Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .
Their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that `` with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved '' .
Certainly no other seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years .
John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts , negotiated , with Franklin and Jay , the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice President and our second President .
He served as president of the Continental Congress .
The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service .
In taking account of seventeen years of law practice , Adams concluded that `` no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did '' and `` for so little profit '' .
Hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet .
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends .
`` If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars '' , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury .
Hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle .
This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee , Peter Van Schaack .
Those writers known collectively as the `` Southern school '' have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ; ;
The effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force .
Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money .
but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type .
Presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; ;
Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .
but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .
As John T. Westbrook says in his article , `` Twilight Of Southern Regionalism '' ( Southwest Review , Winter 1957 ) : `` The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with '' .
On this trip to the South he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight '' .
He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably .
Faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County , the gradual changes which seep into the South , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way .
An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process of projective verse : `` one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception '' .
He is still concerned , however , with a personal event .
But in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work .
He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .
Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .
It may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground .
This became a dance called Prelude To Flight .
Events occur without apparent reason .
Then the choreographer must arbitrate .
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee .
Writing to Speed on August 24 , 1855 , Lincoln made the latter point clear .
Dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the Articles of Confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy .
It made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches .
The Constitution of the Southern `` Confederation '' differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects : It openly , defiantly , recognized slavery -- an institution which the Southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution .
`` we the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common Defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America '' .
`` We the people of the Confederate States , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God -- do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America '' .
He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union .
On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the `` brave men , living and dead , who fought here '' .
Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ? ?

We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .
In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .
Apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .
In agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster .
There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .
Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .
He seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face .
We walked down the Rue De L'Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church .

He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .
The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most `` mature '' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture .

The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation .
This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these `` religious '' heights .

These my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending .
More potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .
even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a vine-embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle , or when Rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire , even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside .
In the heat of the summer , the garden solitudes were ours alone ; ;
If a child watched its progress he whispered , `` Hay , hay , load of hay -- make a wish and turn away '' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses' feet returned no more .
No one seemed to hear him , no one heeded .
It became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness .
they were like this fifty-odd years ago , and yesterday .
It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story , because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious , riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann's work .
The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` birdlike brain '' .
The music which Lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' .
But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art '' .
a modulation described as `` almost a stroke of genius '' .
It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and , simultaneously , his wife's infidelity .
By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; ;
the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; ;
Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's heroes .
it is particularly the artist ( Tonio Kroger , Aschenbach , Leverkuhn ) who suffers from it .
That this abandonment takes place on a stage , during an ' artistic ' performance , is enough to associate Jacoby with art , and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ; ;
In a certain perfectly definite way , the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same .
Piepsam tries to stop him by force , receives a push in the chest from `` Life '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage , while a crowd begins to gather .
This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .
This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .
as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : `` His justice is not of this world '' .
Piepsam calls the cyclist `` cur '' and `` puppy '' among other things , and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face .
The cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , `` blithe and carefree '' .
But he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist .
in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled , according to gossip , upon the painter's mistress .
On the street outside , Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world , such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence , and prophetically he issues his curse : `` Gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter '' .
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another .
As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images .
When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds , when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves , compelling the observer into an attitude of attention , all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance .
Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed .
In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers .
The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; ;
As long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data , most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity , becomes an invention of consciousness , and the result is a philosophical scepticism .
After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though `` in a slight degree '' , to be sure .
It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on .
It's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .
People talk about `` the law of the land '' .
Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead letter .
Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ? ?
Calhoun dealt with this question in his `` Disquisition On Government '' .
The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything .
It would be interesting to know how much `` integration '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England .
that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution which professes to be `` national '' .
Being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier's `` Massachusetts To Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown '' .
Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .
It is something which most of us try to get out from under .
Like the cowboy in Stephen Crane's `` Blue Hotel '' , we run around crying , `` Well , I didn't do anything , did I '' ? ?
A man must be able to say , `` Father , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him .
Emerson -- Platonist , idealist , doctrinaire -- sounded a high Transcendental note in his `` Boston Hymn '' , delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause : `` Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim .
New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : ``
A Yale historian , writing a few years ago in The Yale Review , said : `` We in New England have long since segregated our children '' .
He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .
One is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children .
Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present .
Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .
`` I scanned the world through printed symbol swart , And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man .
On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .
The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .
Not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .
The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` Thoughts in Loneliness '' is , as Professor Book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .
His next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .
He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory .
Heidenstam's conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past .
About one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .
Hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; ;
Somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature .
The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .
Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers .
Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .
He finds it in utter misery and desolation .
But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died .
He had become king at fifteen .
Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory .
Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries .
Whatever his original assignment , the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime , usually a murder .
He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; ;
In the mystery story , as in The Wealth of Nations , individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin .
As capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival , the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma .
If he is good , he may not be legal ; ;
he is very close to being a mental case .
he is a recluse , an incredible egotist , a confirmed misogynist .
but the society which he serves bores him to tears .
Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the detective , so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both .
In the modern English `` whodunnit '' , this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared .
Sam Spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; ;
but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake .
For Sam Spade , neither crime nor virtue pays ; ;
The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care .
If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .
As a word of caution , we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types , question , command , statement , or exclamation .
This , and other qualifications , make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up .
Thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness .
In spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group , the Af incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if N exceeds about six .
In Figure 2 , the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number .
The numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors .
Since the hazards of poor communication are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes , a mine , or a sugar maple camp .
Military organizations .
Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making , network structure seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network has value .
On the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in Figure 3 .
No questions , statements , or explanations are permitted -- only commands .
The commands are specified by the military regulations ; ;
This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop .
The number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55,987 men .
This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent .
A further regulation is that commands always go down , unaccompanied by statements , and statements always go up , unaccompanied by commands .
Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach .
This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss , for example , in precision machinery and mathematics , or the Finns in geochemistry .
Some fourteen or fifteen years ago , in an essay I called The Leader Follows -- Where ? ?
The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier .
We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations .
The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .
And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : `` in essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism '' .
I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism .
Others invoked technology and common sense .
But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent .
Noting such evidence is the first step ; ;
We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .
Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .
best growth .
corporations now outmoded
But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; ;
and our loss of `` prestige '' abroad is the direct result .
The biggest loss , of course , was the individual's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .
In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .
Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; ;
Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot .
corporations , being more amorphous , cannot .
To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti-democratic .
Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .
Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .
If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? ?
Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition .
During the last years of Woodrow Wilson's administration , a red scare developed in our country .
Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts , credit ideas with high potency .
they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ; ;
The writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St. Joseph , Missouri .
He tells of his `` Jewish heart '' -- not a Shylockian heart ; ;
but a Jewish heart .
There is no justification for such misrepresentation .
The Leopard's Spots came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law .
If a child had a single drop of Negro blood , he would revert to the ancestral line which , except as slaves under a superior race , had not made one step of progress in 3,000 years .
Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity ? ?
Children , conditioned by this mistaken notion , have feared stepmothers , while adults , by their antagonistic attitudes , have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one .
Will mere debate on that proposition , even though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross and leave a residue of refined gold ? ?
Research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one .
For a time the President received hundreds of them every day , most of them worthless .
We are reminded , however , that freedom of thought and discussion , the unfettered exchange of ideas , is basic under our form of government .
If he had been `` liquidated '' in some way , he would have become a martyr , a rallying point for people who shared his ideas .
Debate rid us of McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive .
By no means would we discourage the production of ideas : they provide raw materials with which to work ; ;
The President's personality would have opened that office to him .
And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance .
And if Howard Rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession , his article in the Atlantic Monthly accomplished a good deal more .
Because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President , rather than with his doctors , nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure .
He commented -- thoughtfully , a reporter told us -- that it was `` not too important for the individual how he ends up '' .
Only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death .
And we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us .
`` I may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age '' , the President had said on February 29th of the election year , ignoring the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term .
Only infrequently did the situation color his thinking .
Yet with a mind less shallow , if less sharp , than some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him , he feels what he cannot formulate ; ;
What is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the laws of human probability , whether or not it is later confirmed , has become by September of the election year `` a firm conviction '' .
Thinking had stopped ; ;
He chooses to subordinate one to the other , sometimes reluctantly , accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed .
The division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change .
The first involves a simple shift of interests in the society .
The ontological status of society thus is constituted by the psychological status of society's members .
The content of that psychological status determines , ultimately , the content of civilization .
Further , change is a form of motion , it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change .
Now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness of the fading form .
Within the individual the reaction has been called various names , all , however , pointing to the same basic experience .
Within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed responses to the experience of civilizational crisis , two basic organizations of response are observable : reaction and ideological progressivism .
Moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order , once the activation of change has reached visible proportions .
In its dynamic form , it visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force -- the race , for instance , which unfolds in history .
Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history .
I am suggesting that a case-history approach to the Oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller .
If I now risk some comparisons with Sons And Lovers let it be clear that I am not comparing the two works or judging their merits ; ;
`` The Rocking Horse Winner '' is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the reader -- but we do not know why .
It was , of course , a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal .
How does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader ? ?
The rocking is actually felt in the story , a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy .
Ortega's hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled .
He has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character .
Thomas Mann wrote The Holy Sinner in 1951 .

As Helion's work showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature , the pure abstractionists expressed some disapproval ; ;
His canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be `` Figures In Space '' , or `` Blue Figure '' , or `` Pink Figure '' ; ;
Abstract art was still the right path for him ; ;
But he was `` afraid of the future -- he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration , a functional art of some kind '' .
But whereas the postwar American abstractionists seem to Helion to be determined to `` escape '' from the real world , or simply to rebel against it , the ordered abstractions which he and his associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the hope of `` improving '' things .
`` I arrived in the United States with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions '' .
In New York he was well received by what was then only a small brave band of non-figurative artists , including Alexander Calder , George K. L. Morris , De Kooning , Holty and a few others .
After a year in a studio on Sheridan Square , having married an American girl who was a native of Virginia , Helion moved to a village in the Blue Ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases .
`` Fear possessed me , and the certainty of war '' , he has related .
In June , 1940 , Sergeant Helion , with a company of reserve troops waiting to go into battle , was sketching the hills south of the Loire River , when the war suddenly rolled in upon him .
In the Stalag , Helion came to know and love his comrades , most of them plain folk , who , in their extremity , showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other .
At this moment the volley-ball hit the ground .
I left behind me brave men , whom captivity had robbed of all hope .
After that , he declared , `` to return to freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and adore it '' .
In prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life , his guards , his companions in misery .
Arp protested : `` But it is impossible ! !
It was very widely read , too ; ;
They reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920's .
These new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most , hence associated with the sense of lost freedom : the cafe at the corner , the newspaper kiosk , the girls in doorways and windows along the street , the golden-crusted French bread they lacked , the cigarettes denied them .
Important as was Mr. O'Donnell's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has .
Faulkner's total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when Mr. O'Donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the South .
If the barn-burner's family produces a Flem Snopes , who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the Compson family produces a Jason Compson 4 .
The young William Faulkner in New Orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist Hamilton Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so .
Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have Stark Young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society .
William Gilmore Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him .
It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to Faulkner's time .
Such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality in the South and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent .
Such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; ;
Each man , that is , is both one and many .
He is a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the circumstances of today .
He is a Craig's wife who agonizes about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the local university have come to call .
Mr. Lyford continues : ``
We would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries .
The Introduction continues : ``
These institutions which Mr. Lyford names `` agreeable autocracies '' -- where did they come from ? ?
But however we come , finally , to explain and account for the present , the truth we are trying to expose , right now , is that the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises .
This life has its own currents and rhythms , its own multiple cycles and adaptations .
Moreover , the sun's path over earth described a segment of a great circle ; ;
this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon .
Why , for example , should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation of the heavens to be elliptical ? ?
Or angular ? ?
Now what is perfect motion ? ?
It must , apparently , be motion without termini .
It is never motion towards something .
Thus , circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect celestial existence .
This gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements .
Pure fire ( the stars ) is in the heavens .
But the natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest , nor rectilinear motion .
Copernicus' achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy .
The Almagest and The Hypotheses outline Ptolemy's conception of his own task as the provision of computational tables , independent calculating devices for the prediction of future planetary perturbations .
Another contrast stressed when discussing Ptolemaic vs. Copernican astronomy , turns on the idea of simplicity .
This , of course , results from the non-systematic , ' cellular ' character of Ptolemaic theory .
There are in The Almagest no rules for determining in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with abberations in lunar , solar , or planetary behavior .
De Revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques .
In what does the dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist ? ?
Copernicus required a systematically integrated , physically intelligible astronomy .
His objective was , essentially , to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends .
The latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies .
Without abandoning too much , Copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable .
One who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger .

In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew theology to Johns Hopkins students , and this brought to the Szold house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained by Henrietta and Rachel , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on Sunday evenings .
Joseph Jastrow , the younger son of the distinguished rabbi , Marcus Jastrow , was a friendly , round-faced fellow with a little mustache , whose field was psychology , and who was also a punster and a jolly tease .
And when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do , Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and Papa did .
and `` Marmee '' March , like Sophie Szold , was the competent manager of her brood of girls , of whom the Marches had only four to the Szolds' five .
Neither was Henrietta hoydenish like Jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like Henrietta's , was the feminine form of a boy's name .
Bertha Szold was more like Meg , the eldest March girl , who `` learned that a woman's happiest kingdom is home , her highest honor the art of ruling it , not as a queen , but a wise wife and mother '' .
A Comedy In Three Acts '' , in which , under `` Personages '' , Henrietta appeared as `` A Schoolmarm '' , and Bertha , who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than Henrietta had been , appeared as `` Dummkopf '' .
And just as `` Laurie '' Lawrence was first attracted to bright Jo March , who found him immature by her high standards , and then had to content himself with her younger sister Amy , so Joe Jastrow , who had also been writing Henrietta before he came to Johns Hopkins , had to content himself with her younger sister , pretty Rachel .
Olgivanna -- in her country the nickname was a respectful form of address -- was not only attractive but shrewd , durable , sensible , and smart .
No wonder Wright was enchanted -- no two better suited people ever met .
but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying , both for Wright and his Montenegrin lady .
It must be granted that the flouting of convention , no matter how well intentioned one may be , is sure to lead to trouble , or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval .
Flocks of writs , attachments , and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air .
The distracted Miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative , then change her mind and make another attack on Wright as a person .
A troop of reporters brought up the rear .
Miriam was stopped at the Taliesin gate , and William Weston , now the estate foreman , came out to parley .
Then , with staring eyes and lips drawn thin , Miriam said to the young woman , `` You are ugly -- uglier than you used to be , and you were always very ugly .
As if to make certain that Wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all , Miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him ; ;
Then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , `` I will never leave Mr. Wright '' .
But surely Michigan Avenue was handsome ? ?
`` Take a gigantic knife and sweep it over the Loop '' , Wright said .
Little enough joy was afforded Wright in the spring of 1925 , when another destructive fire broke out at Taliesin .
A series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time ; ;
Billy Koch , who had once worked for Wright as a chauffeur , gave a deposition for Miriam's use that he had seen Olgivanna living at Taliesin .
This exhausted Wright's patience , and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite .
Although his tender nights were not the ones I dreamed of , nor was it for yachts , sports cars , tall drinks , and swimming pools , nor yet for money or what money buys that I burned , I too was burning and watching myself burn .
It was symbolized ( at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image ) by that self-consuming , elegiac candle of Edna St. Vincent Millay's , that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a beacon to us , but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral taper to last even the evening , let alone the night .
Perhaps the mere fact that by plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us , temporarily anyway , the sleeping poet , and in poets can discover their immortality , is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can attest ? ?
Whether you experienced the passion of desire I have , of course , no way of knowing , nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment of a wish to know , for the fact that one constitutes by one's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest , more scandalizing , more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a stranger .
I recoil from the very thought .
You probably would not remember , since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as I , much less their intensity , one sunny midday on Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the Farm .
I can see us now .
We had stopped before a shop window to assess its autumnal display , when you suddenly turned to me , looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats , and with your nervous `` ahem '' ! !
Said : `` There are things I must tell you about this man you are marrying which he does not know himself '' .
While my memory holds with relentless tenacity , as I cannot too often stress , to my wrongs , when it comes to my shames , it gestures and jokes and toys with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from them .
But the time came when I was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless .
Helpless in that sense I can never be again .
However , I confess my hope that I will be innocent again , not with a pristine , accidental innocence , but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone .
For innocence , of all the graces of the spirit , is I believe the one most to be prayed for .
To innocence , a word given is a word that will be kept .
A lady , you made clear to me both by precept and example , never raised her voice or slumped in her chair , never failed in social tact ( in heaven , for instance , would not mention St. John the Baptist's head ) , never pouted or withdrew or scandalized in company , never reminded others of her physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture , never indulged in public scenes or private confidences , never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering , never gossiped or maligned , never stressed but always minimized the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself .
He rummaged , found composers and arrangers , collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization with musicians , ballad singers , and musicologists .
First , Carl respects his audience and prepares his speeches carefully .
Even when he is called upon for impromptu remarks , he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes .
He has his own system of shorthand , devised by abbreviations : `` humility '' will be `` humly '' , `` with '' will be `` w '' , and `` that '' will be `` tt '' .
Segovia has written about Carl :
`` His fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help in disciplining them .
I found that this precocious , grown-up boy of 74 deserved to be taught .
I am certain that Carl Sandburg will not fall into the same sad philosophy .
Mr. Rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one .
They went to the pawnshop of Joseph Miller of 1162 Sixth Avenue .
He walked home at night for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley .
One fame is precious and luminous ; ;
Her clothes , her hair , everything about her is both graceful and simple .
But neither was Lilian her baptismal name .
Her parents , pious Roman Catholics , christened her Mary Anne Elizabeth Magdalene Steichen .

She was pious , too , once kneeling through the night from Holy Thursday to Good Friday , despite the protest of the nuns that this was too much for a young girl .
Carl was still Charles A. Sandburg .

Certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation ; ;
The international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the early postwar years .
But the enmities it will incur , the isolation into which it will descend , and the internal moral and spiritual softness that will be engendered , will , in the long term , bring it to economic and political disaster .
America did not become great through softness and self-indulgence .
To us and to every nation of the Free World , rich or poor , these qualities are necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater security , prosperity and peace .
Respecting their need , one of the major focal points of our concern is the South-Asian region .
Free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom .
Until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions .
But I once again assure all peoples and all nations that the United States , except in defense , will never turn loose this destructive power .
During the past year , our long-range striking power , unmatched today in manned bombers , has taken on new strength as the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory .
Such performance is a great tribute to American scientists and engineers , who in the past five years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles , where America had none before .
The continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process .
This is necessary for a sounder collective defense system .
satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the globe ; ;
and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the data we seek .
The accomplishment of the many tasks I have alluded to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual , intellectual , and economic sinews of American life .
Among current problems that require solutions , participated in by citizens as well as government , are :
He knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence .
The Gross group had been formed for the express purpose of advising the Secretary General .
Hammarskjold's supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross is illusion , at best .
But by the time the papers were finally disposed of , the group had informed the world of its purpose , its recommendations , and its belief that Paul Bang-Jensen was not of sound mind .
''
Gross had received Marshall courteously and they were discussing the case .
Supposing you or I were being accused in this manner , and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work .
Gross bristled .
For an instant he glared speechless at Marshall .
It was getting so that we , the Committee , were being tried .
`` The reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list .
As far as I'm concerned , it was a separate matter from the general Committee study of Bang-Jensen's conduct .
Gross paused and repeated himself .
`` The entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list , since many in the press were querying the U.N. about it .
He could have been blackmailed , or his family might have been threatened .
`` Mr. Gross , concerning the formation of your Committee , there's the fact that you have been a legal adviser to the U.N. in the past ; ;
`` Why , Mick Shann went over and over the report with Alsing Andersen , trying to check them out .
Gross pointed to the Manley story .
He probably didn't mean to write it this way , or maybe he did .
There wasn't any ' violent argument ' between Bang-Jensen and Shann , as the Tribune puts it .
That implies that Shann was on the enemy side .
So once again Shann had to argue with him about this .
Don't forget , I am an old member of the club , a former delegate .
It appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the Hungarian situation .
Ernest Gross replied the next day , putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest .
It wished to pursue , in the course of this review , questions arising from the body of material already in its possession .
`` We were requested by the Secretary General , as I understand it , to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant , and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the Secretariat .
In spite of Pickering Dodge's explicit instructions regarding variation of meals , the food did not seem the same as at home .
Finally , tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise , they decided to dance instead .
The weather turned warmer and with it came better appetites , although Harriet was still a little off-color .
Sometimes a ship would be sighted and the Caravan pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck .
At this time Harriet wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in India was sent to her mother :
I can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming , oh , what a luxury .
I have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel , and the almost intolerable smell after the rain , that I have done little more than lounge on the bed for several days .
Born a Congregationalist , he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops of water sprinkled on his head , yet nowhere in the whole of the New Testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized by sprinkling .
What would happen if Adoniram `` changed horses in midstream '' ? ?
but I hear the thunder roll ; ;
and the waves threatening to swallow up the vessel ; ;
`` On each side of the Hoogli , where we are now sailing , are the Hindoo cottages , as thick together as the houses in our seaports .
The grass and fields of rice are perfectly green , and herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river , and the natives are scattered about differently employed .
Some are fishing , some driving the team , and many are sitting indolently on the banks of the river .
This is the most delightful trial I have ever had '' , she decided .
The Indians who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly , even if she was suitably shocked , according to the customs of the society in which she had been reared , to find them `` naked , except a piece of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle '' .
Six
The first act of Adoniram and Samuel on reaching Calcutta was to report at the police station , a necessity when landing in East India Company territory .
All Captain Gibault took back to Salem were a few items for the town's East India Museum .
After that Salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly Burma .
They despised foreigners .
`` Go back to America or any other place '' , well-meaning friends of Captain Heard advised them , `` but put thoughts of going to Burma out of your heads '' .
When he discovered they had received from the Company's Court of Directors no permission to live in India , coupled with the fact that they were Americans who had been sent to Asia to convert `` the heathen '' , he became more belligerent than ever .
She describes , first , the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by this `` unseasonable exultation '' ; ;
Swift , in the Dublin edition of A Preface to the Bishop of Sarum's Introduction , indicated his feelings by including Molesworth , along with Toland , Tindal , and Collins , in the group of those who , like Burnet , are engaged in attacking all Convocations of the clergy .
The preliminaries ended with the publication of Steele's Crisis on January 19 , and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace .
By this time , as we shall see , the Tories were already planning to `` punish '' Steele for his political writing by expelling him from the House of Commons .
To this end , the first and longest section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the Revolution to defend England against the `` Arbitrary Power of a Popish Prince '' .
Anne was furious , and Bolingbroke advised that the request be refused .
As notable examples of this abuse , he quotes passages from the Examiner , `` that Destroyer of all things '' , and The Character of Richard Steele , which he here attributes to Swift .
It purports to be a letter from Steele to a friend at court , who , in Miss Blanchard's opinion , could only be meant as Swift .
Then he launches into an attack on the Tory ministers , whom he calls the `` New Converts '' ; ;
The Tory leaders , he insinuates , are cynically using the Church as a political `` By-word '' to increase party friction and keep themselves in power .
If `` Jack the Courtier '' is really to be taken as Swift , the following remark is obviously Steele's comment on Swift's change of parties and its effect on their friendship : `` I assure you , dear Jack , when I first found out such an Allay in you , as makes you of so malleable a Constitution , that you may be worked into any Form an Artificer pleases , I foresaw I should not enjoy your Favour much longer '' .
When Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer , begun some years before .
Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs , Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work on .
He was born in Savannah , Georgia , in 1909 .
His second wife , Lillian , was the mother of John H. Mercer .
The mother inquired , `` Where's Johnny , and why did you leave him '' ? ?
When he was fifteen John H. Mercer turned out his first song , a jazzy little thing he called `` Sister Susie , Strut Your Stuff '' .
There they stayed '' .
The check had been mailed from Chicago , the envelope bore no return address , and the check was not signed .
When the troupe traveled to New York to participate in a one-act-play competition -- and won -- Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New York .
While with the Whiteman band Mercer met Jerry Arlen .
Mercer's Whiteman association brought him into contact with Hoagy Carmichael , whose `` Snowball '' Mercer relyriced as `` Lazybones '' , in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of Mercer's song-writing career .
The countrywide success of `` Lazybones '' and `` And The Angels Sing '' could only lead to Hollywood , where , besides Harold Arlen , Mercer collaborated with Harry Warren , Jimmy Van Heusen , Richard Whiting , Walter Donaldson , Jerome Kern , and Arthur Schwartz .
He may be the only song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U. S. Treasury ; ;
Though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with the best of them , Mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit .
After we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked out , we'd get together for an hour or so every day .
After I would finish playing the songs , he'd just go away without a comment .
Arlen is one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer Mercer has been able to work with so closely , for they held their meetings in Arlen's study .
he often uses very odd rhythms , which makes it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric writer '' .
Besides doing a single song , `` When The Sun Comes Out '' , they worked on the ambitious American-Negro Suite , for voices and piano , as well as songs for films .
The American-Negro Suite is in a sense an extension of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection of Negro songs , not for a night club , but for the concert stage .
By September 1940 the Suite had developed into a collection of six songs , `` four spirituals , a dream , and a lullaby '' .
Thoroughly modern in treatment , they are at the same time , full of simple sincerity which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music and are by no means to be confused with the average ' Broadway Spirituals ' which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the ' Amen Corner ' , ' judgement Day , ' Gabriel's Horn , and a frustrated devil -- with a few random hallelujahs thrown in for good measure .
It had a single porcelain stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards .
He seemed timid ( at first , ) wore nose glasses from which a black ribbon dangled , and was no bigger than a jockey .
Robinson asked Herford to escort him to the club's lavatory before they sat down for a highball and a game of cards .
Without any regard for rest-room protocol , the hulking stranger almost knocked Herford off his pins .
The artist-author said nothing , but stood to one side .
Indeed , he looked more like a well-fleshed lay brother of the Hospice of St. Bernard .
He had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the bodies were buried .
He supported his mother and his brother , who afterwards committed suicide .
Watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother , blossoms bought with Vic's allowance to him .
' And would you believe it ' , Vic added , ' she likes him better than she does me .
Mr. Baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the Friars .
I thought it expedient to take off my derby , my glasses , and the beard ; ;
I managed to do this by the time the great A.B. returned to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist .
He exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters , Nat Ferber and Carl Helm .
In the conduct of these and many other campaigns , the Hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed .
It seems to me now , in a long backward glance , that many of the Hetman's conceits and odd actions -- together with his grim posture when brandishing the hatchet in the name of Mr. Hearst -- were keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day .
The unfinished note , written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope , and addressed to the coroner , makes one wonder about many things : `` God forgive me for everything .
Much to Damon Runyon's amazement , as well as my own , I got along splendidly with the Hetman ; ;
Not long after Colonel Van Hamm had foisted me on the Watson staff I received a salary raise and a contract on the Hetman's recommendation .
Dr. Menas S. Gregory was another .
I used to go with Watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment , to sit among the doctor's excellent collection of statues , paintings , and books and drink Oriental coffee while Watson seemed to thaw out and become almost affable .
The President was even more generous with the First Lady than he had been before the tragedy .
He got her dozens of them .
The Coolidges' life , after the death of their son , was quieter than ever .
Now and then , the President would call for `` Little Jack , Master of the Hounds '' , which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the White House since Teddy Roosevelt's administration , and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals .
That was Rob Roy , who posed with Mrs. Coolidge for the portrait by Howard Chandler Christy .
It is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the Smithsonian .
There is a long train flowing from the shoulders .
Mrs. Coolidge gave Mama this dress for me , and I wore it many times .
The last two were a red and a black chow .
But she was afraid the First Lady would not understand , because Rob Roy was a perfect angel with the First Family .
He would not make a sound until the President had wakened and left for the office ; ;
All the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the President and go to the dining room .
Mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the First Family returned .
It was a high mark for Mama .
They seemed to be at the White House half the time .
A new bill had been passed under Harding that designated the Government , rather than the President , as the tab-lifter for official meals .
He knew exactly how to be colorful ! !
Another good friend of the Coolidges' was George B. Harvey , who was the Ambassador to Great Britain from 1921 to 1923 .
She was not an overnight guest in the White House , but Mr. Ike Hoover , the chief usher , had Mama check her fur coat when she came in , and take care of her needs .
Mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen .
She wore grey every day , and white every evening .
On the social side , the chore Mama had at the formal receptions at the White House thrilled her the most .
It was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs , and , just as the First Lady stepped off the last tread , Mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the Blue Room to greet her guests with the President .
Mama stooped down to fix the train , but there was no train there ! !
But the two do not invariably or even typically coincide .
The working test of `` the facts '' must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation to relevant situations .
Granted , such `` functional '' images are subject to human error ; ;
if so , he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future .
To some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments .
The tasks are briefly indicated by these questions : What are my goals in Gentile-Jewish relations ? ?
What are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized ? ?
What policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values ? ?
The discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy .
When decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion .
for instance , imagine the situation if Israel ever joins an enemy coalition .
By the same test predispositions destructive of human personality exercise their most sinister impact , with the result that men of good will are often trapped and nullified .
Among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near the limit of self-control .
A truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best .
For this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary ; ;
In essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others , rather than in one's own values and experience .
Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important .
And find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species .
One would need to test this proposition carefully ; ;
Literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose , dedication , mission , significance .
Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation .
A fourth view is the transformation of emotion , as in Housman's fine phrase on the arts : they `` transform and beautify our inner nature '' .
It is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea .
F.S.C. Northrop , in his discussion of The `` Functions And Future Of Poetry '' , suggests this : `` One of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of common-sense objects .
But there is one in particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention .
In the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate .
Something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem , the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like `` expressions '' of these emotions , without aiming at their incitement or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement '' .
Along these lines , the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than I have seen .
In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Personal Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject , with one possible exception ; ;
Solomon Asch shows the transcultural stability of metaphors based on sensation ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc. ) dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events .
I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs , a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling .
We are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue , or even Shakespeare and Titian .
but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place .
The natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art , to despise and dislike the art of the recent past , and wholly to ignore everything else '' .
There results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary .
It is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight .
also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man .
On the other hand , Arnold's `` The unplumbed , salt , estranging sea '' , taken in its context , certainly does so .
Our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries .
Accordingly we may speak of the Platonism peculiar to Shelley's poems or the type of Stoicism present in Henley's `` Invictus '' , and we may find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise .
We may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts .
Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread .
Hegel's profound admiration for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy .
This was not before the House but before the Judiciary Committee , where he asked for action on one of his pet bills , that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly .
Six of the railroads carrying coal to Tidewater from the Pennsylvania fields , Hearst said , not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines .
They had watered their stock at immense profit , then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton , netting themselves another $20,000,000 in annual profit .
`` The Attorney General has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months '' , Hearst said .
There can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in Washington , overt or implied , to block anything Hearst wanted , even if it was something good .
He might get votes from his constituents , but he would never get a helping hand in Congress .
There was a host of dark horses .
A Bay State supporter said , `` Mr. Hearst's fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of his paper in Boston '' .
In a story headed , `` Hearst Offers Cash '' , the Republican New York Tribune spread the money rumor , quoting an unnamed `` Hearst supporter '' as saying :
The alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds , and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a Democratic victory absolutely fruitless .
In his own state of New York , the two Democratic bellwethers , State Leader Hill and Tammany Boss Murphy , were saying nothing openly against Hearst but industriously boosting their own favorites , Murphy being for Cleveland and Hill for Parker .
More splenetic was Senator Edward Carmack of Tennessee , a Parker man .
If he's going to the St. Louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it .
Our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents and retainers .
As for the paid Hessians from other states , we are here to instruct the Indiana Democracy in their duty , I have nothing but contempt .
Every letter answers itself in a couple of weeks '' .
I supported Cleveland three times and Bryan twice .
This was historic in its way , for it marked the first time an American Presidential aspirant had advertised his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land .
The three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic of Trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous through his later works -- a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority .
The outstanding example was in Garibaldi And The Thousand , where he made use of unpublished papers of Lord John Russell and English consular materials to reveal the motives which led the British government to permit Garibaldi to cross the Straits of Messina .
Trevelyan accepts Italian nationalism with little analysis , he is unduly critical of papal and French policy , and he is more than generous in assessing British policy .
But fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification of Italy , a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at the time of publication .
Already Trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century Italian studies with several works on English figures of the same period .
Yet he is right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man , his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength .
It is a Whig history of the `` Tory reaction '' which preceded the Reform Bill of 1832 , and it uses the figure of Grey to give some unity to the narrative .
For once his touch deserted him .
By what one reader called a `` series of dissolving views '' , he merges one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth .
These lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of English development which took form afterward as A History Of England .
In short order , the general history became his most popular work and has remained , aside from his later Social history , the work most widely favored by the public .
That was all they needed .
As I got off the trolley at Kehl bridge the next morning , I was met by what looked like 5,000 students , some of whom were carrying sticks apparently for the coming `` battle '' with the police .
`` I thank you most heartily for being here .
These principles , however , will not be served by violence in any form .
If they are right , they will prevail of and by themselves .
Now , let's go '' .
I took one step eastward .
`` I must then be standing on the line between France and Germany '' .
I mean ''
`` No line '' ? ?
Now I learn I cannot enter Germany .
Finally they went off to file their stories , after the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil .
Some students from the University returned around six with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week .
No matter how large the fire , I couldn't seem to shake off the chill that day .
`` Oh , Mr. Davis , are you there '' ? ?
`` Who is it '' ? ?
I wouldn't hear of it because it meant giving up the `` line '' , though I realized I was in poor shape physically .
`` But of course , with pleasure '' , he replied .
Esther looked at me .
`` What is your name '' ? ?
I asked him .
`` Jean Babel '' .
`` Shake '' , I said .
`` I am so happy .
Six climactic minutes in an individual's life left no memory .
Eight hundred and sixty-five Rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day .
The measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice .
Hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors .
In the midst of this gloom , at 10:05 P.M. on September 2 , Slocum's telegram to Stanton , `` General Sherman has taken Atlanta '' , shattered the talk of a negotiated peace and boosted Lincoln into the White House .
Halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war .
Sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from Lovejoy's to Atlanta .
He would ship by rail five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country .
First , it could locate the enemy infantry , learn what they were doing , and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over .
It could reach key tactical points faster than infantry and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot soldier .
Merited recommendations from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees from civil life .
Luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not I '' .
Katherine was staying at a convent , and her mother felt that , as Thompson himself seems to have suggested , she might eventually stay there .
But if you are able & care to come , you know how glad I shall be .
It is strange ; ;
In `` My Song's Young Virgin Date '' , for example , Thompson wrote : `` Yea , she that had my song's young virgin date Not now , alas , that noble singular she , I nobler hold , though marred from her once state , Than others in their best integrity .
Reid simply states , without offering any supporting evidence , that `` after he returned to London , he resumed his draughts of laudanum , and continued this right up to his death '' .
He simply found more work for him to do , and the articles and reviews continued without an evident break .
It was , of course , in this drawing of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire to do full justice to an author .
Poetry , he said , must be `` dogmatic '' : it must not stoop to argue like a `` K.C. in cloth-of-gold '' .
At General Headquarters the newcomer in turn got to know others .
Representing the Emperor were the Prince De Ligne , still as impetuous as a youth of twenty ; ;
and General the Count Pallavicini , founder of the Austrian branch of that celebrated Italian house , a courtier Littlepage could have met at Madrid in December , 1780 .
and the artillerist , Colonel Prevost , whom the Count De Segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills to Nassau .
From America were the Messrs. Littlepage and Jones .
An entire theater had been set up for his diversion , with a 200-man Italian orchestra under the well-known Sarti .
At dinner the courses were carried in by tall cuirassiers in red capes and black fur caps topped with tufts of feathers , marching in pairs like guards from a stage tragedy .
Among the visitors arriving every now and then there were , of course , women .
As Littlepage noted : `` A complete picture of Prince Potemkin may be had in his 1788 operations .
Alexander Vasilievitch Suvorov , now in his fifty-ninth year ( ten years Potemkin's senior ) , was a thin , worn-faced person of less than medium height who looked like a professor of botany .
He had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side , a large flat nose , and penetrating blue eyes .
Kind by nature , he never refused charity to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it ( as Lewis would one day discover ) .
Age ? ?
Suvorov's contempt for don't-know's was proverbial ; ;
Despising luxuries of any sort for a soldier , he slept on a pile of hay with his cloak as blanket .
His breakfast was tea ; ;
his dinner fell anywhere from nine to noon ; ;
Underneath , he remained one of the best-educated Russians of his day .
He looked disapprovingly at an ash tray piled high with cigarette stubs , shook his head , and moved his hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture .
At this moment Mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem was solved and all Norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers .
After luncheon we took advantage of the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our dear friend Deppy had written .
The wear and tear of life have taught me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers , but I planned on being the soul of tact , of giving them plenty of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already running over without us .
The curving benches are broken , chipped , tumbled , but still in place , as are the marble chairs , the seats of honor for the legislators .
Will it live up to its reputation ? ?
The weight of fame and history is formidable , and dreary steel engravings in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination .
Don't worry about the Acropolis .
In 1687 the Turks , who had been in control of the city since the fifteenth century , with a truly shattering lack of prudence used the Parthenon as a powder magazine .
My other nugget of art and architectural knowledge -- besides remembering that it was Ghiberti who designed the doors of the baptistery in Florence -- is the three styles of Greek columns .
The Acropolis was unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flooded by moonlight wasn't enough for both natives and tourists , then they were quite simply barbarians and the hell with them .
Office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during the siesta period , which , during the summer , lasts from two until five in the afternoon , when shops and offices are again open for business .
The sand is fine and pleasant , the cabanas are clean , and the parasols , green , raspberry , and butter yellow , are very gay .
One is Greece is not yet suffering from overpopulation .
Later they would be hoisted into place .
To enter it , you go down five or six steps from the road .
-- But let him be ready to invent whatever falsehood -- to assail whatever character -- and to prostitute his paper to whatever ends -- and they hug him to their heart .
he accused Pike of continuing his sticky-fingered career in Arkansas with the theft of some otter skins in Van Buren .
The charges caught Pike off balance , coming as they did from an unexpected quarter .
Without further inquiry , Pike jumped to the conclusion that Robinson was guilty , and , following the honorable route that would eventually lead to the dueling ground , sent a message to Robinson through his friends , demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity .
In the next few months of comparative silence , Pike waited patiently until conditions were perfect for a new attack , and then , displaying a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting , gained from his first bout with Woodruff , he used these changed conditions to excellent advantage .
Besides being political allies , they were also friends .
Woodruff was furious .
As summer cooled into fall and winter , even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow colder by the day , and by December of 1834 it was icy .
If Woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation , the governor insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in The Advocate .
Very angry at Woodruff , the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract withdrawn from The Gazette and awarded to the lowest bidder , which , by a strange coincidence , happened to be Pike's Advocate .
A biographer called him `` the premature John the Baptist of New England Transcendentalism '' .
Edward Rawson , secretary of the colony of Massachusetts Bay , described him as `` a man whose spirit was stark drunk with blasphemies and insolence , a corrupter of the truth , a disturber of the peace wherever he comes '' .
Samuel Gorton was born at Gorton , England , near the present city of Manchester , about 1592 .
The report was : ``
When , in March , 1640 , the two towns were united under Coddington , Gorton claimed the union was irregular and illegally constituted and that it had never been sanctioned by the majority of freeholders .
The next week , forty soldiers were sent to get the miscreants .
Gorton and ten of his friends were thrown in jail .
The prisoners agreed , provided they might speak after the sermon , which was permitted .
What he means when he saith , wee worship the starre of our God Remphan , Chion , Moloch '' ? ?
All of the elders except three voted for death , but a majority of the deputies refused to sanction the sentence .
The convicts were put in chains , paraded before the congregation at the Reverend Cotton's lecture as an example , and sent to prisons in various towns , where they languished all winter , chains included .
The hemorrhage was in the prostate region ; ;
Dr. Glenn saw at once what had happened .
The doctor agreed , but explained that it would be necessary first to check Fred's blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type as Papa's .
That was in the days before blood banks , of course , and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to patient .
by now it was perhaps two days or longer after Papa had begun hemorrhaging .
The burial was out in Riverside Cemetery .
The bills were principally for hospitalization and doctors' fees during the last years of his life , and when he died he owed in the main only current doctor's bills .
After they had paid all his debts and the funeral costs , Ralph and Fred had some fourteen thousand dollars , as I remember , with which to pay the bequests .
So what Fred and Ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking into account what each of the five had received , if anything , from the estate before Papa's death .
So , because he had received less than Tom , it was felt proper that Fred should receive the few hundred dollars that remained .
For years Papa and Mama had been large taxpayers .
35 .
In the spring of his second year at Harvard , Tom had been offered a job at Northwestern University as an instructor in the English Department .
And that's what he did .
That third year he wrote plays with a fury .
I think I'm right in that figure .
In this play there were so many characters and so much detail .
And he threatened someday to write a play `` with fifty , eighty , a hundred people -- a whole town , a whole race , a whole epoch '' .
On returning to New York he had a job for several weeks ; ;
The Graham Memorial would be the campus student union honoring the late and much beloved Edward Kidder Graham , who had been president when Tom entered the university .
This man , Tom said , had the play shut up in his desk , I believe , and when Tom sat down , he pulled it out and apologetically told Tom that they wouldn't be able to use it .
Tom was not willing to revise the play according to the plan the man suggested .
It was not until we had returned to the city to live , while I was still at Brown and Sharpe's , that I felt the full impact of evangelical Christianity .
The spirit of this group was that we were -- and are -- living in a world doomed to eternal punishment , but that God through Jesus Christ has provided a way of escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation .
There are millions who accept this doctrine , but few indeed are those who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on their souls night and day .
Much of this lacked the active support of the pastor .
This doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense .
and the doctrine of original sin is compounded of injustice .
They have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years which since have passed .
I do not claim to be free from sin , or from the need for repentance and forgiveness .
If obeyed , the law brings order and satisfaction .
Their basis seems deeper than mere authority .
They are not true because scientists or prophets say they are true .
In his book Civilization And Ethics Albert Schweitzer faces the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business life , for example .
His Ethics defines `` possessions as the property of the community , of which the individual is sovereign steward .
One serves society by conducting a business from which a certain number of employees draw their means of subsistence ; ;
This viewpoint I find interesting , but it has never weighed on my soul .
So far as `` sacredness '' inheres in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality , whether in Lambarene , Africa , or in Washington , D.C. .
yet here was a depth of sensibility which is lacking in a considerable portion of the beneficiaries of our civilization .
This intellectual approach to spiritual life suited me well , because I was never content to lead a divided life .
As I have said , words from Tennyson remain ever in my memory : `` That mind and soul , according well , May make one music as before '' .
Let us now give some thought to the soul .
When the young biologist , Dr. Ballard , began to show interest in our daughter Elizabeth , this induced a corresponding interest , on our part , in him .
One such is Abraham Meyer , the writer of a recent book , Speaking Of Man .
I have chosen five contrasting pairs , ten men in all , and they are arranged in roughly chronological order .
Altogether , the list will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones , for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider art above ethics , all the way from Plato to Poe .
Plato and Aristotle
In short , he is constantly concerned with the ethical effects .
Plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something of an enigma , because he is so completely sensitive to its charm .
A tragedy , by his definition , is an imitation of an action that is serious , of a certain magnitude , and complete in itself .
Any tragedy , he maintains , has six elements : plot , character , and thought ( the objects of imitation ) , diction and melody ( the means of imitation ) , and spectacle ( the manner of imitation ) .
For one thing , Aristotle mentions that plays may corrupt the audience .
In his study Samuel Johnson , Joseph Wood Krutch takes this line when he says that what Aristotle really means by his theory of catharsis is that our evil passions may be so purged by the dramatic ritual that it is `` less likely that we shall indulge them through our own acts '' .
And we can add that Krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to Plato's fear that poetry will encourage our passions .
According to William Ringler's study , Stephen Gosson , the theater business in London had become a thriving enterprise by 1577 , and , in the opinion of many , a thoroughly bad business .
But his opposition hardened and by 1579 , in The School Of Abuse , he was ready to banish all `` players '' .
He advises women to beware `` of those places which in sorrows cheere you and beguile you in mirth '' .
Fortunately , it is possible to be somewhat more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in education .
In the latter research program , information is available for 2,758 Cornell students surveyed in 1950 and for 1,571 students surveyed in 1952 .
We find , in the first place , that the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education , positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing , do not accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the public prints , and , on the whole , approve of the way their university deals with value-problems and value inculcation .
The selective and directional qualities of basic value-orientations are clearly evident in these data : the `` success-oriented '' students choose vocational preparation , the `` other-directed '' choose goals of social adjustment ( `` getting along with people '' ) , the `` intellectuals '' choose a liberal arts emphasis .
Our students want occupations that permit them to use their talents and training , to be creative and original , to work with and to help other people .
Within the fixed frame of these aspirations , they can afford to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power , prestige , and wealth .
For there is also the `` face of reality '' in the form of the individual's perceptions of his own abilities and interests , of the objective possibilities open to him , of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed .
Furthermore , many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands , or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity , or of ability and performance .
In their views on dating , courtship , sex , and family life , our students prefer what they are expected to prefer .
Avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as to be a curiosity .
At the same time , a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means of personal adjustment , an anchor for family life , a source of emotional security .
after all , feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions of youth .
A few days later it was learned that General Howe was planning an attack upon the American camp .
But the Maryland militia had likewise fled , all too typical of this type of soldier during the Revolution , an experience which gave Morgan little confidence in militia in general , as he watched other instances of their breaking in hot engagements .
After complimenting Morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to Congress , too , the ardent Frenchman added he felt that Congress should make some financial restitution to the widow and family of Morris , but that he knew Morgan realized how long such action usually required , if it was done at all .
But you could ( as from yourself ) tell her that you had friends who , being with the army , don't know what to do with their money and would willingly let her have one or many thousand dollars '' .
Such a situation regarding the Board of War could hardly have helped Morgan's chances for promotion when that matter came before the group later on .
The position of the new camp was admirably selected and well fortified , its easily defensible nature being one good reason why Howe did not attack it .
Also , he was now forty-three years old .
`` The reason for this '' , the orders said , `` is that the enemy may think to take advantage of the celebration of this day .
But Morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence much more important to his commanding general .
It is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures on the pope .
When the negotiations began , his quarrel with the king of France was temporarily in abeyance , and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there was hope that French money would come to pay the troops who , under Charles of Valois , the papal vicar of Tuscany , were so valuable in the crusade against the Colonna cardinals and their Sicilian allies .
Boniface was later to explain to the English that Robert of Burgundy and Guy De St.-Pol were easy enough to do business with ; ;
And yet he made no pretense about it ; ;
These shifts in alliance and allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the English embassy as a whole , but also directly involved the two Savoyards , Amadee and Othon .
But all the reports of this first embassy show that the two Savoyards were the heads of it , for they were the only ones who were empowered to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably absent .
In the eyes of those who still cared for such things , it was a reflection on his honor , and it gave further grounds for complaint to his overtaxed subjects , who were already grumbling -- although probably not in Latin -- `` Non est lex sana Quod regi sit mea lana '' .
A northern ambassador , willing to keep his mouth shut and his ears open , could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead at the Curia .
My father would have done it if it hadn't been for my mother , who had a fear of being in debt to anyone -- even Alfred Alpert .
Everything was all very friendly , except when it came to Harry , the youngest brother .
From that day on he never spoke to Harry or to Lew , or to Lew's two boys , Mort and Jimmy .
The six miles between the towns became an ocean and the Alperts became a family of strangers .
And when Alfred was forced into his bed , Tessie left the front porch of the store and sat at home , rocking in her rocker in the living room , staring out the window -- the rose still in her hair .
I remember him pointing out of the window and saying that he wished he could live to see another spring but that he wouldn't .
My father , a wise man , asked him not to .
He knew Alfred liked me ; ;
The day Alfred left his home and Fleischmanns he gave up the convictions of a lifetime .
Then Meltzer's voice , quiet , calm , strong , started the Kaddish , the prayer for the dead .
There was a finality in the rhythm of the prayer -- it was the end of a life , the end of hope , and the wondering if there would ever be another beginning .
Meltzer stayed with Alfred , and when the door opened they both came out .
Alfred nodded a little nod and went out through the door .
Alfred looked straight ahead .
The car began to move and Harry ran after it crying , `` Alfred ! !
Alfred ! !
They lived in the same house and it didn't seem to be such a hard thing to do , but the sad realities of Lilly's life and the fact that Meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful thinking .
Banks the Butcher was a hard master and a hard father , a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade .
He treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt ; ;
perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung silently from his hooks .
I helped Lilly in the store .
I wanted to help so that we could find time to play .
The road past the butcher shop took us along the side of a stream .
It ran north , away from the town and the people , through woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard .
I would have liked the town and the busyness of its people but I always followed Lilly into the peace of the silent and unstaring road .
When we went for our walks Lilly's brother would come along every once in a while .
This huge hulk played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream .
The song , he said , was called `` The Stream's Lullaby '' , and when he sang , `` Gute ruh , Gute ruh , Mach't die augen zu , '' there was such longing and such simple sadness that it frightened me .
I felt very flattered to be included in the protection of their company even though I had nothing to be protected from .
What was true for archaeology was also true of place-name studies .
Even in the nineteenth century such accomplished philologists as Kemble and Guest were led into what now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical philological development .
Even before the century was out the tide of reaction had set in .
It was Plummer , in fact , who coined the much quoted remark : `` Mr. Green indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the Saxons and had watched every step of their subsequent progress '' .
Nevertheless , in another way modern historians still labor in the vineyard of the Oxford school .
) of Celtic art forms and a considerable proportion of the Celtic population , reject any institutional legacy from pre-Anglo-Saxon Britain .
Now omitting for a moment some recent developments we can say the Saxon Shore hypothesis of Lappenberg and Kemble has undergone virtual eclipse in this century .
The few scholars who have adopted the `` shore occupied by '' interpretation , Howorth , Shore , and Wade-Evans , have all been Celtic survivalists .
The problem , in other words , is strictly a chronological one .
It might be well to consider the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer to one important question ; ;
Before the Draft Act was passed Baker had confidentially briefed governors , sheriffs , and prospective draft board members on the administration of the measure -- and the confidence was kept so well that only one newspaper learned what was going on .
Democratic Speaker Champ Clark saw little difference between a conscript and a convict .
In spite of powerful opposition the Draft Act finally passed Congress on May 17 , 1917 .
The total operation was a construction project comparable in magnitude with the Panama Canal , but in 1917 time was in short supply ; ;
It was the first American war in which the death rate from disease was lower than that from battle , due to the provision of trained medical personnel ( of the 200,000 officers , 42,000 were physicians ) , compulsory vaccination , rigorous camp sanitation , and adequate hospital facilities .
To the middle of September 1918 , there had been fewer than 10,000 deaths from disease in the new army .
In spite of this catastrophe the final mortality figure from disease in the American Army during World War 1 , was 15 per 1,000 per year , contrasted with 110 per 1,000 per year in the Mexican War , and 65 in the American Civil War .
six days after war was declared he appointed Raymond Fosdick chairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities ( the CTCA ) .
His assignment was not a new one because Baker had sent him to the Mexican border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack of discipline , drunkenness , and venereal disease in American military camps .
The problem involved military necessity as much as morality , for in pre-penicillin days venereal disease was a crippling disability .
There was no time in the short Mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the area provided a proving ground for new departures in the near future .
New Orleans had a notorious red-light district extending over twenty-eight city blocks , and the business-minded mayor of the city journeyed to Washington to present the case for `` the God-given right of men to be men '' .
Under Fosdick the first executive officer of the CTCA was Richard Byrd , whose name in later years was to become synonymous with activities at the polar antipodes .
The CTCA program of activities was profuse : William Farnum and Mary Pickford on the screen , Elsie Janis and Harry Lauder on the stage , books provided by the American Library Association , full equipment for games and sports -- except that no `` bones '' were furnished for the all-time favorite pastime played on any floor and known as `` African golf '' .
The sense of relationship overreaches the historical truth that Shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual works of Aeschylus , Sophocles , and Euripides .
We cannot conceive of Oedipus without a Sphinx , nor of Hamlet without a Ghost .
Agamemnon , Creon , and Medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes of the polis .
They are enacted at the heart of the body politic .
Greek and Elizabethan life and , to a certain extent , the life of Versailles shared this character of intense `` publicity '' .
I refer to the notion that the structure of society is a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history conforms to patterns of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality play set in motion by the gods for our instruction .
The dream of achieving a synthesis between the Sophoclean and the Shakespearean genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time of Shelley and Victor Hugo to that of Bayreuth .
The dream of a descent into the gardens of the south always drew German ambitions toward Rome and Sicily .
Bridges , a son by his second wife , was christened at Pebworth in 1607 , but Thomas the younger was living at Packwood two years later and sold Broad Marston manor in 1622 .
He had been in London for several weeks when he wrote to Shakespeare on October 25 .
Allso that if monei might be had for 30 or 40 a lease & might be procured '' .
Sturley quoted Quiney as having written on November 1 that if he had `` more monei presente much might be done to obtaine our Charter enlargd , ij faires more , with tole of corne , bestes , and sheepe , and a matter of more valewe then all that '' .
Sturley's allusion probably explains why Greville took out the patent in the names of Best and Wells , for Sir Anthony Ashley described Best as `` a scrivener within Temple Bar , that deals in many matters for my L. Essex '' through Sir Gelly Merrick , especially in `` causes that he would not be known of '' .
This seems to refer , not to the loan Richard had asked for , but to a proposed bargain with Shakespeare .
& 20 more Mr. Peeter Rowswell tooke order with his master to paie for mee '' .
and I was six days going thither and coming homewards ; ;
The corporation proposed Chief Justice Anderson for an arbiter , sending him a gift of sack and claret .
Adams firmly contended that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical environment on history .
However , as a practicing historian , he , himself , has left few clues to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing history .
A credulousness , a distaste for documentation , an uncritical reliance on contemporary accounts , and a proneness to assume a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all evidences of his failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public .
Much criticism has been leveled at this rather forced analogy , but what is equally significant is Adams' complete acceptance of the Biblical record as `` good and trustworthy history '' .
A similar amateurish characteristic is revealed in Adams' failure to check the accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources .
Such manipulations are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression of the monasteries during the English reformation .
What is exposited by this observation is not the inherent prejudices of Englishmen but the Anglophobia of Brooks Adams .
On matters of race he was similarly inflexible : `` Most of the modern Latin races seem to have inherited the rigidity of the Roman mind '' .
For Adams had made up his mind before all the facts were available .
All critics of Adams and his methods have observed this particular deficiency .
Moreover , he believed that most professional historians lacked some of the essential instruments for a proper study of history .
and , since the historian should only be interested in strictly terrestrial activity , his research should eliminate the supernatural .
In fact , he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in the forest of Ecuador .
Moreover , he had spent six months on the Galapagos islands , among the great turtles that Captain Cook had found there , and now and then he would disappear into some small island of the West Indies .
Never hearing from him again , I remembered the little boy of whom I had had such doubts when he was ten years old .
Finally we got them out of the house , after the boy had run away four times looking for other Nazis , threatening to murder village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next Fuhrer .
It reminded me of my other professor , Edward Kennard Rand , of whom I had been so fond when I was at Harvard , the great mediaevalist and classical scholar who had asked me to call him `` Ken '' , saying , `` Age counts for nothing among those who have learned to know life sub specie aeternitatis '' .
He had written to me about a dinner he had had with the Benedictine monks at St. Anselm's Priory in Washington .
There were several men of ninety or more whom I knew first or last , all of whom were still productive and most of whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the apex of their lives .
I never met John Dewey , whose style was a sort of verbal fog and who had written asking me to go to Mexico with him when he was investigating the cause of Trotsky ; ;
Sedgwick had chosen to follow the philosophy of Epicurus whom , with his followers , Dante put in hell ; ;
`` Did you ever know a man with greater zest for information ? ?
Later , rising ninety , he was beset by publishers for the story of his life and miracles , as he put it , but , calling himself the Needy Knife-grinder , he had spent his time writing short articles and long letters and could not get even a small popular book done .
Then , all but blind , he said there was nothing in Back to Methuselah -- , -- `` G.B.S. ought to have known that '' , -- and `` I look at my bookshelves despairingly , knowing that I can have nothing more to do with them '' .
Many years later I went to see S.K. in England , where he was living at Whiteleaf , near Aylesbury , and he showed me beside his cottage there the remains of the road on which Boadicea is supposed to have travelled .
He was convinced that George Orwell's 1984 was nearly all wrong as it applied to England , which was `` driving forward into uncharted waters '' , with the danger of a new tyranny ahead .
He looked at her as she spoke , then got up as she was speaking still , and , simply and wordlessly , walked out .
And that was the end .
He did not neglect his wife in Cromwell Hall , but telephoned her and wrote her with assurances of his continuing interest and of his wish to `` stand behind '' her in their separation and of his hope that there would be no bitterness between them .
He was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go abroad when the Gantry galleys were finished .
As they stood at the first-class rail , waving down to his wife and Casanova below , Lewis said , `` Earl , there is Gracie's future husband '' .
To the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life , about his wish to be a newspaperman once more , about the prevalence of American slang in British speech , about the loquacity of the English and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage , about his plans to wander for two years `` unless stopped and made to write another book '' .
The New York Times editorialist wondered just who would stop Mr. Lewis and make him write a book .
These rumors of permanent separation started up a whole crop of stories about her .
It was a dinner party , Lewis had been drinking during the afternoon , and long before the party really got under way , he was quite drunk , with the result that the party broke up even before dinner was over .
Lewis , at the head of the table , would leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks that , when not highly offensive , were at least highly inappropriate , and then presently he collapsed and was put to bed .
`` And from now on , for the rest of this trip , I will only drink what you agree that I should drink '' .
He suggested that they call on these brothers , who received them pleasantly .
He said , `` We had a good time tonight , didn't we , Earl '' ? ?
Then he kept Blackman awake for more than an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife and himself in which , discussing the evening , he was continually berated .
There were four from St. John's and four from Christ's , three from Pembroke , and two from each of the colleges , Jesus , Peterhouse , Queens' , and Trinity , with Caius , Clare , King's , Magdalene , and Sidney supplying one each in the ordo senioritatis .
The second name was ( Edward ) Kempe , matriculated from Queens' College at Easter , 1625 .
He was ordained deacon 16 June and priest 22 December 1633 .
Venn gave his B.A. as 1624 , a mistake for 1629 .
Manningham also proceeded M.A. in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year .
Small wonder that Milton later boasted of how well his work had been received there , since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher than that of any other inceptor from Christ's of that year .
The Gog Magog Hills to the southeast afforded him and all other students a vantage point from which to view the town and university of their dwelling .
but anyone who would put much trust in any phase of Prolusion 6 , except its illusive allusiveness deserves whatever fate may be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously stilted banter .
Aubrey's mention of it ( 2:67 , and Bodleian MS Aubr. 8 , F. 63 ) comes from this prolusion , through Christopher Milton or Edward Phillips .
The entire exercise , Latin and English , is most suggestive of the kind of person Milton had become at Christ's during his undergraduate career ; ;
From an exercise involving merely raucous , rough-and-tumble comedy , in his hands the performance turned into a revel of wit and word play , indecent at times , but always learned , pointed , and carefully aimed at some individuals present , and at the whole assembly .
On the other hand , the bright vision of the future has been directly stated in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies -- science fiction , of course , is related , if sometimes distantly , to that utopian literature optimistic about science , literature whose period of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward and H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia .
Both abolition of war and new techniques of production , particularly robot factories , greatly increase the world's wealth , a situation described in the following passage , which has the true utopian ring : `` Everything was so cheap that the necessities of life were free , provided as a public service by the community , as roads , water , street lighting and drainage had once been .
James Blish's A Case Of Conscience ( 1958 ) describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction in underground shelters ; ;
Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 ( 1954 ) presents a book-burning society in which wall television and hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds ; ;
There is , of course , nothing new about dystopias , for they belong to a literary tradition which , including also the closely related satiric utopias , stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century and Swift's Gulliver's Travels to the twentieth century and Zamiatin's We , Capek's War With The Newts , Huxley's Brave New World , E. M. Forster's `` The Machine Stops '' , C. S. Lewis's That Hideous Strength , and Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four , and which in science fiction is represented before the present deluge as early as Wells's trilogy , The Time Machine , `` A Story Of The Days To Come '' , and When The Sleeper Wakes , and as recently as Jack Williamson's `` With Folded Hands '' ( 1947 ) , the classic story of men replaced by their own robots .
In addition , there are many areas of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which are examined , for science-fiction dystopias often extrapolate political , social , economic tendencies only indirectly related to science and technology .
and the atmosphere is so befouled that no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs .
While The Space Merchants indicates , as Kingsley Amis has correctly observed , some of the `` impending consequences of the growth of industrial and commercial power '' and satirizes `` existing habits in the advertising profession '' , its warning and analysis penetrate much deeper .
What is wrong with advertising is not only that it is an `` outrage , an assault on people's mental privacy '' or that it is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains a coercive tendency ( which is closer to the point ) .
Rather what Kornbluth and Pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent in perfecting `` a science of man and his motives '' .
Thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet , the person `` capable of putting together words that stir and move and sing '' .
As Courtenay explains , `` Here in this profession we reach into the souls of men and women .
Now the basic question to be asked in this situation is what motivates the manipulators , that is , what are their values ? ?
But there is , nevertheless , always a subtle difference in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held .
No good can come of contemplating the sad , inevitable fact that once youth has passed `` a worse and worse time still succeeds the former '' .
But there are at least two reasons for contemplating one's mind in even a cracked mirror .
Even to be `` from hope and fear set free '' is at least better than to have lost the first without having got rid of the second .
One may be exasperatingly aware that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of one's own age .
But at least the question has been raised .
Many readers of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately , even if they have never actually been told , what my age is .
At least I should like them to know that I know these discounts are being made .
I have known some men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember seem utter strangers to them now ; ;
Never once during the trying thirties did I come so close to succumbing to the private climate of opinion as to grant Russian communism even that most weasel-worded of encomiums `` an interesting experiment '' .
Blasphemous ? ?
Despite these facts the question `` : :
The work as it stands is not the entire book that Malraux wrote at that time -- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called La Lutte avec l'Ange ; ;
Even in its present form , however , the first part of Malraux's unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of mid-twentieth century literature ; ;
This magnificent but greatly underestimated book , which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time as no other comparable creation , has suffered severely from having been written about an historical event -- the Spanish Civil War -- that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political feuds .
These lines never cease to haunt the book amidst all the exaltations of combat , and to make an appeal for a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal necessities of war .
Malraux , to be sure , does not abandon the world of violence , combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as a creative artist , and which is the only world , apparently , in which his imagination can flame into life .
Here I am face to face with the primeval stuff '' .
The intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of the text ; ;
`` For six years my father had had to do too much commanding and convincing , '' writes the narrator , `` not to understand that man begins with ' the other ' '' .
And when Vincent Berger returns to Europe , this first result of his encounters with mankind is considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation .
In a pessimistic assessment of the cold war , Eden declared : `` There must be much closer unity within the West before there can be effective negotiation with the East '' .
Thus far the advances made have been almost entirely along functional lines .
The problem of NATO is not one of machinery , of which there is an abundance , but of the will to use it .
The NATO Council is available as an executive agency , the Standing Group as a high military authority .
Conceived as an organ of economic cooperation , there is no reason why O.E.C.D. cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members so desire .
For centuries the North Atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other .
A realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization on the one hand , and our capacity to achieve them on the other , must be approached through the concept of `` community '' .
Such proposals look to an apocalyptic act , a kind of Lockian `` social contract '' on a world-wide scale .
A working concept of the organic evolution of community must lead us in a different direction .
A realistic `` concert of free nations '' might be expected to consist of an `` inner community '' of the North Atlantic nations and an `` outer community '' embracing much or all of the non-Communist world .
Even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry .
Patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles , and Patchen himself has remained outside the San Francisco poetry group , maintaining a self-imposed isolation , even though his conversion to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first appear .
His first book , Before The Brave ( 1936 ) , is a collection of poems that are almost all Communistic , but after publication of this book he rejected Communism , and advocated a pacifistic anarchy , though retaining his revolutionary idiom .
He spoke for a `` proletariat '' that included `` all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth '' .
Beauty as well as love is redemptive , and Patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation .
In Patchen's eyes , organized churches are as odious as organized governments , and Christian symbols , having been taken over by the moneyed classes , are now agents of corruption .
The private detective must rely , as the Youngest Son or Trickster Hero does in primitive myth , on his wits .
The differentiation between the East Coast and West Coast schools of jazz , the differences between the `` hard bop '' school of Rollins , and the `` cerebral '' experiments of Tristano , Konitz and Marsh , the general differences in the mores of white and Negro musicians , all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public .
He is forced to play for little money , and must often take another job to live .
His revolutionary anger is apparent in most of his early poems .
Angry because I was that very one somebody was supposed To be fighting for '' .
'' Patchen is still the rebel , but he writes in a doleful , mournful tone .
Perhaps Patchen was once involved in a train accident , and this passage from First Will And Testament may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he first saw it -- if he did : ``
He spent one year at the University of North Carolina because Thomas Wolfe went there .
he displays what outlanders call the New York mind , a state that the subject is necessarily unable to perceive in himself .
The New York mind is two parts abstraction and one part misinformation about the rest of the country and in fact the world .
Closely related to his illusions about his typicality is Krim's complicated feeling about his Jewishness .
their reading and thinking gave an extension to their normal blushes about appearing ' Jewish ' in subway , bus , racetrack , movie house , any of the public places that used to make the Jew of my generation self-conscious ( heavy thinkers walking across Seventh Avenue without their glasses on , willing to dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the ikey-kikey caricature of the Yiddish intellectual ) .
Krim says , in short , that he is a suffering Jew .
The only possible answer to that is , I am a suffering Franco-Irishman .
This is not to deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos , but only to assert that these horrors have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience them , that among the various side effects is the local hysteria of Jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion , which they call oppression and pain .
Some of us have imagination and sensibility too .
'' Partisan has failed , Krim says , for being `` snob-clannish , overcerebral , Europeanish , aristocratically alienated '' from the U.S. .
What Krim ignores , in his contempt for history and for accuracy , is that these magazines , Partisan foremost , brought about a genuine revolution in the American mind from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950 .
Without the good magazines , without their book reviews , their hospitality to European writers , without above all their awareness of literary standards , we might very well have had a generation of Krim's heroes -- Wolfes , Farrells , Dreisers , and I might add , Sandburgs and Frosts and MacLeishes in verse -- and then where would we be ? ?
Literary movements are the '' , creation of pimps who live off writers .
No one was ever educated through bull-sessions in anything other than , to quote him again , `` perfumed bullshit .
The most appalling aspect of Krim's piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic .
He mentions the beats only once '' , when he refers to their having revived through mere power and abandonment and the unwillingness to , commit death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression and actual experience , , but the entire narrative , is written in the tiresome vocabulary `` of '' that lost `` and '' dying cause , `` and in the '' `` sprung syntax that is supposed to supplant , our mother , tongue .
There had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and defacing of the bust of Lauro Di Bosis near the Villa Lante and in the Gianicolo .
Something was happening all right , slowly it is true , but you could feel it .
At least they hadn't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated , flat , dialect mispronunciation of Mussolini's home district -- Dogumenti , per favore .
We saw Giuseppe Berto at a party once in a while , tall , lean , nervous and handsome , and , in our opinion , the best novelist of them all except Pavese , and Pavese is dead .
Now he was married to a beautiful girl , had a small son , and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies .
He was interested in Italo Svevo .
He was thinking his way into a new novel , a big one , one that people had been waiting for .
It was going to be hard going all the way because he hadn't written seriously for a while , except for a few stories , was tired of the old method of realismo he had so successfully used in The Sky Is Red .
He knew all about it and had put it down in journal form in The War In A Black Shirt , a wonderful book not , for some strange reason , published in the U.S. .
Our companion was a huge , plain-spoken American sculptor who had been a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across France in 1944 .
`` Oh , it would be butchery all right '' , the European said .
I thought : Who is older now ? ?
They went up against an SS unit of comparable size , over a little rise of ground , over an open field .
`` Excuse me '' , the European said .
Like everything else in Rome , ruins and monuments alike , that house is lived in .
She had her reasons for this .
) And then there were ecclesiastical matters , the matter of Garibaldi's anti-clericalism .
Some of the marble busts in the park are of young Englishmen who fought and died for Garibaldi .
It is hard for me to know how I feel about Lauro Di Bosis .
His bust shows an intense , mustached , fine-featured face .
And there is something so wonderfully romantic about it all .
It is remembered and has been commemorated by a bust in a park and a square in the city which was renamed Piazzo Lauro Di Bosis after the war .
Most Romans , even some postmen , know it by the old name .
Faced with a gesture like Di Bosis' , I find usually that my sentiments are closer to those of my sculptor friend .
She showed us what had happened to her .
The English lady was pleased and enthusiastic .
Maybe twenty , thirty , fifty .

Advice is given also on problems of plant location and plant space .
Under this program , property sales specialists in the Small Business Administration regional offices help small business concerns to locate Federal property for sale and insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for surplus personal and real property and certain natural resources , including timber from the national forests .
SBA works closely with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those types of property that small business concerns are most likely to be interested in purchasing .
Each SBA regional office also maintains a `` want '' list of surplus property , principally machinery and equipment , desired by small business concerns in its area .

Only a very few of the more advanced ones , such as India and Pakistan , have developed systematic techniques of programing .
surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy , such as transport , agriculture , communication , industry , and power ; ;
and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established .
The application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot , of course , be mechanical .
At the other end of the spectrum , where the more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program , we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support , in cooperation with other developed countries , of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program .
A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help .
Aid advice is not interference
2 .
It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed .
Otherwise , development will not lead to longrun stability .
Yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if dishonesty , corruption , and favoritism are widespread .
This is not a short-run goal .
Dams , river development schemes , transportation networks , educational systems require years to construct .
More importantly , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence .
Providing an incentive
The extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources , to set targets toward which they should be working , to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention , and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves , all on a realistic long-term basis , will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them .
So , I say , Mr. Speaker , God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the United States of America and the free world .
In my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle .
For what Sam Rayburn's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district .
He will be considered not only great among his contemporaries , but as great among all the Americans who have played a part in the country's history since the beginning .
I pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn , stalwart Texan and great American , not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than twice as long as Henry Clay , but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress .
No one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has Sam Rayburn .
He is the recognized `` father '' of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security and Exchange Commission .
Mr. Monagan .
of his championship of many of the progressive social measures which adorn our statute books today , and of his cooperation in times of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today's stormy international seas .
A review of these policies indicates : ( 1 )
Actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles on state business at the rate of $.07 per mile .
The average of states' rates is $.076 per mile .
Rhode Island's rate of $.07 per mile is considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a $.09 per mile average .
Travel allowances are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control .
Origin of state automobile practices
Few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940 .
The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917 .
Once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly .
It does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy .
Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical .
Prior to 1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned .
In 1942 , however , the nation was at war .
Gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities .
It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation .
One indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 , while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% , the total maintenance cost increased only 11% .
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation .
In 1959-60 , vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile .
Purchasing practices .
Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made .
Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders .
Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the dealers .
In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool , cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier .
There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well .
Notwithstanding state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax .
This is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored .
Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) situs , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value .
Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated .
The location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged .
In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft .
This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably justifiably .
The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property .
A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units '' .
The replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case .
Boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats .
The need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies .
It is known that at least five towns ( Barrington , Bristol , Narragansett , Newport and Westerly ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes .
No one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be .
The assessors' association , meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem .
a new post-World War 2 , record .
What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs .
Of the major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R. I. Industrial Building Authority's 100% guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer Wire , Leesona Corporation , and American Tube & Controls .
Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc. Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W. R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company .
Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries , small business is also afforded considerable attention .
Our media advertising continued , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stressed such specifics as 100% financing , plant availabilities , and location advantages .
We also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here .
The direct mail campaign consisted of 3 intra-state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics , plastics , pharmaceutical , and business machine manufacturers , and to publishers .
164 from media and 75 from direct mail .
Industrial promotion
An important operation in soliciting industrial locations involves what we term `` Missionary calls '' by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists .
Out of a total of 603 calls , 452 contacts were established with top executive personnel .
We received 76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigating Rhode Island's industrial advantages , and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits .
Morning sessions included addresses by Ward Miller , Jr. of the U. S. Dept. of Commerce .
Devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island , it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division .
The Industrial Division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial brochure , `` Rhode Island -- Right For Industry '' , and prepared copy for a new edition of the Directory Of Manufacturers ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space catalogue .
Additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation Turnkey , the new automated post office , and a conference with representatives of Brown University , Providence College , and University of Rhode Island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel .
Stated in its simplest terms , the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island .

Long-range state planning
The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 .
Analysis
Special districts in Rhode island .
It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island .
However , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government .
There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County Water Authority ) .
Unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits .
In eleven states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 ( Arkansas , Colorado , Indiana , Kansas , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Ohio , South Dakota , Utah , Washington , and Wisconsin ) .

Of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes .
Borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times .
It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap ; ;
Little can be done about the changing of dates .
It usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time .
What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them .
These municipalities include : Barrington , Lincoln , Middletown , Newport , North Kingstown , and South Kingstown .
However , neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year .
Assuming an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3 .
it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques .
In addition , no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition .
These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ;
Suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds .

Of these exhibits , 154 were newly constructed .
Nine veterinary lantern slide teaching sets were developed and distributed , and lantern slide teaching sets on 21 pathology subjects were added to the loan library of the Medical Illustration Service .
Sixteen lantern slide sets were loaned to the Government of India and eight sets were forwarded to the U.S. Embassy , Managua , Nicaragua for the Educational Exchange Program .
These registries are sponsored by 18 national medical , dental , and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural history of various diseases of military-medical importance .
These were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes .
In this same period , six new fascicles of the Atlas Of Tumor Pathology were published and distributed to medical centers world-wide .
A three-dimensional exhibit depicting `` A Century Of Naval Medicine '' was formally presented to The Director by George S. Squibb , great-grandson of the founder of E. R. Squibb and Sons , for permanent display in the Museum .
In addition , their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin .

Occasional features were published on historical medicine , special reports , bibliography , and `` Collector's Items '' .
Using Edgerton's method , the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires .
The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera .
During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera .
Laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra .
To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started .
Results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas ; ;
Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 Af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium .
A hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium .
However , the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface .
Pressure transducer for pvt measurements .
A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested .
Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one millimeter of mercury .
A 6-year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed .
The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000 to 10,000 Af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from Af to Af times normal density .
These thermometers have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory .
During the last week of march 1961 , Columbus , Ohio was the site of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature , Its Measurement And Control In Science And Industry .
Dr. A. V. Astin , NBS Director , opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the Washington and Boulder Laboratories .
The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation .

We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter -- the two-way B. & O. - C. & O. merger , or the three-way New York Central - B. & O. - C. & O. merger .
Which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public ? ?
Mr. Oakes succeeds Charles Merz , editor since 1938 , who now becomes editor emeritus .
The people of the 17th District of New York , and I as their Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world .
Yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News & World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages .
But the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board .
You can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; ;
We simply can't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba .
The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba .
Three requirements go with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; ;
the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; ;
Once these conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk .
Plenty , say the experts .
Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia .
Recent changes .
Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act .
The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act .
( See Source of Data , below , for per capita income data to be used in this step .
Determine the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U. S. ( Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above .
By law this is 75% for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico .
Square each State's allotment percentage .
) 11 .
( Each State's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year , which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23,000,000 , must be reduced by the amount of the excess .

Funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine .

When the roof blocks are all in place , the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position .
Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection .

Aboveground double-wall shelter
( See fig. 9 , double-wall shelter .
The walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built .
These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface .
A contractor probably would be required to help build it .
His charges would be added to the cost of materials .
The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection .
Plans for the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are shown on pages 26 and 27 .
It would add about $500 to the total cost of the home .
The entrance must have at least one right-angle turn .
The rest continues in a straight line .
Basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 .
But the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous .
How soon you may go outdoors ; ;
Records such as diaries can be kept .
A record should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of broadcast .
There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement .
Water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully .
Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided .
A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level .
In general , such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space .
The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest .
353 U. S. , at 605 .
Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies .
that General Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial ; ;
The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition .
International Salt Co. v. United States , 332 U. S. 392 , 400-401 '' .
Counsel for the Government invited Du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days .
Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty & Investment Company , major stockholders in Du Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten-year period , of Du Pont's General Motors stock allocable to them , as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright .
It argued , inter alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; ;
The decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in August of 1958 .
Both plans also prohibited common directors , officers , or employees between Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on the one hand , and General Motors on the other .
It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship .
While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage .
By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U.S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection .
and his conviction is sustained .
Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board .
Daniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United States .
Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment .
We have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale of Gonzales v. United States , 348 U.S. 407 ( 1955 ) , and United States v. Nugent , 346 U.S. 1 ( 1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment .
He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; ;
The appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation .
The appeal board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department's recommendation .
Upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so .
Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching .
But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file .
This he failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file .
As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact .
But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult .
Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed .
We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context .
Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad .
It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense .
Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy .
Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer .
The problems of a policy officer
I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces .
Whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine .
The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility .
But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy , well-established precedents , the commitments of the United States under international charters and treaties , basic statutes , and well-understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers accumulated in the Department .
He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance .
Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice ? ?
If action is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem ? ?
Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body ? ?
What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? ?
If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership .
I doubt , for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals .
And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels .
The Peace Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family , unless the wife is also accepted for full-time Peace Corps work on the same project .
There should be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service .
Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid .
Wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts .
The idea of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people .
Support for it cuts across party , regional , ethnic and other lines .
How and when should the Peace Corps be launched ? ?
The Peace Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost .
If launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks , the Peace Corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall .
The need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest .
There would , however , be a variety of other skills -- medical , agricultural , engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects .
A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters .
The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership .
Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year .
These could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad .
It can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country .
The letters home , the talks later given by returning members of the Peace Corps , the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world .
The Peace Corps thus can add a new dimension to America's world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting .
This organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work .

This work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment , and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly hazardous debris concentration , felling snags on 350,000 acres of high lightning-occurrence areas , prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres , removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres , and clearing and maintaining 11,000 miles of firebreaks .
Protection from other damage
Rodent control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of the most serious infestations of harmful rodents , such as porcupines and mice , on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands .
The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions .
It is estimated that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests .
These roads are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests .
( E )
Within the units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular .
In some units , National Forest ownership is well blocked together .
In many others , the previous patenting of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership .
The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands .
The change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other .
Our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war .
Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve .
Retired pay costs are increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel .
On the other hand , the new authority of $3,825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $581 million higher than for 1960 .
The Department of Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items .
Considering the high cost of the F-108 system -- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project .
Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program .
As a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed .
The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier-based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles .
The Minuteman solid-fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid-1963 .
It is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing .
I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52H with the new turbofan engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case .
In the coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas , Titan , and Polaris missiles also will be procured .

In carrying out this Agreement , the two Governments will seek to assure , to the extent practicable , conditions of commerce permitting private traders to function effectively and will use their best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural commodities .
I have the honor to refer to the Agricultural Commodities Agreement signed today between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of India ( hereinafter referred to as the Agreement ) and , with regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2 , of the Agreement , to state that the understanding of the Government of the United States of America is as follows : 1 .
The Government of India will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent of $4 million ( up to a maximum of $1 million per year ) accruing under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes into currencies other than United States dollars on request of the Government of the United States of America .

Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies , each interferes to some extent with reception of the other .
By this standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A's signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B's signal at that point .
During the period of about 4 hours around sunset , skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail ; ;
during the same period around sunrise , skywave transmission is declining , until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance .
With respect to nighttime assignments , the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves ( figs. 1 and 2 of sec. 3.190 of the rules ) giving average skywave values .
Allocation policies
As mentioned , the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations .
( 3 )
Accordingly , the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations .
class 1 , -- B stations are protected at night to their 0.5-mv./m. 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference .

Their locations in all parts of the United States , and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees' minds .
During the biennium reviewed in this Report , our Board of Trustees named able men , younger than the rest of us , to the Board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class administration of the Foundation's affairs :
Dr. James Brown Fisk , physicist , President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , was elected to the Board of Trustees .
He is a member both of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society ; ;
and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions .
Dr. Gordon N. Ray , Provost , Vice-President and Professor of English in the University of Illinois , was appointed Associate Secretary General .
He is a historian , with the great merit of a historian's long view .
and lawyers -- with the great virtues that they are trained to read `` the fine print '' carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are indispensable even in a foundation office .
The present Secretary General has been the Foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago .

That is , to put it realistically , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected .
And the reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity .

As heretofore , our Fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts .
Thus , we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the humanities , the creative arts .

Much of his genius , of course , sprang from his familiarity with clock movements .
During these early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young man's occupation .
Mr. Sharpe's arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most coveted -- time for `` tinkering '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time .
Curious as to what made it work , he built a crude model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread , enabling the crude machine to take stitches .
Mr. Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret , by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock , and reversible tap and die holders .
At that time , during the Civil War , Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files .
As soon as the time came for re-sharpening , the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made .
Although Mr. Brown was not himself its inventor ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use .
The final achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine .
Between that year and the buying out of Mr. Darling's interest in 1892 , a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling , Brown & Sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark .
Also important on the Brown & Sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was Mr. Richmond Viall , Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910 .
In the grinding machine field , expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders , surface grinders , and a wide variety of special and semi-special models .
The company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts .
In the Cutting Tool Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters , end mills and saws .
In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 .
Such a depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries , thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange .
Fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved `` wash and wear '' dresses and blouses made from these fabrics .
Uniconer
This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year .
it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted .
Take-up machines
This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute .
It is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time .
The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee , Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation , has been important in this work .
Construction is well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year .
Operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962 .
In addition , land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future .
We will then occupy the new plant under lease , with an option to purchase .
In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant , we have invested approximately $1,961,000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt , Limited .

Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion , compared to $1.7 billion in 1959 .
Auto set production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959 .
Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 .
In sum , I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally .
Mr. Devey will be responsible for the commercial expansion of VecTrol's line of electronic and electrical power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers , working closely with Walter J. Brown , President and Director of Engineering of the recently acquired Sprague subsidiary .
During World War 2 , , he was a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy .
Mr. Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923 .
He is a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers .
Between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters .
Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course .
He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration .
Letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole , an area that would benefit by more faculty attention .
He can , for example , present significant university-wide issues to the senate .
He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty ; ;
A busy president , conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is .
The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance .
The quality of a president's leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty .
An alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs , plans for the future , qualifications of those on the job , and bright prospects elsewhere .
No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their specialties is quite different .
Recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals .
More than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts .
Funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others .
No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators , budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents .
In the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses in all branches .

The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) .
When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon .
Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface .
The study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25-cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) .
This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25-cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) .
and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-1/2 days after Full Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at Full Moon .
In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 Aj .
Recent interferometer measurements ( Radhakrishnan and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the 960-mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk .
The radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise .
In the observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959 ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6'.7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases .
Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .
This result is plotted along with the 8.6-mm observations of Gibson ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , A .
In the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component .
It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the total arc energy .
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount .
In free-burning electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Af as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere .
The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) .
The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; ;
however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux .
The anode material was porous graphite .
Thus , direct comparisons can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( Ref. 3 ) .
The cathode consisted of a 1/4'' '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper tube .
This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode .
It was exposed to a high velocity gas jet .
In addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation .
The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders .
Transpiration cooled anode with carbon anode holder
The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made .
The size of this hot region was estimated by eye .
The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was Af .
Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 .
The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry .
The temperature dependent value of **ye was taken from Ref. 7 .
There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed .
A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks .
The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described .
Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types .
The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand .
They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures .
The elasticity is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials .
Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at present .
Although the Af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects .
If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar .
If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation .
If A is the major axis of an ellipsoid and B and C are the other two axes , the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis Af , and the difference in pressure along the A and B axes is Af .
It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation .
In other words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink .
The theory predicts a linear dependence of Af on Af , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant .
The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the Af bond in Af .
Here the Af distance is 2.44 Aj .
A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric Af bonds .
Douglass has studied the crystal structure of Af by x-ray diffraction .
There is , then , the possibility that this Af bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data .
X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of Af .
Af .
Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af .
The O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms .
The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds .
Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence .
500 ml of 1M aqueous Af with 1 Af added are heated in a bomb at 170-degrees-C for 48 hours .
The expected weight loss for Af going to Af and Af is 10.6% .
For exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would be 3.10 .
The x-ray data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater .
The value derived was 16 microseconds .
Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77 - 294-degrees-K .
One sample , which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375-degrees-C , showed the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt ) ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared , due to broadening , at low temperature .
The data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375-degrees-C which contain no adsorbed water .
These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate .
Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity .
Harris has indicated that two devices , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics .
Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use .
In this way , numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatches before and after washing .
Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones .
In addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else .
4 .
Obviously , if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced .
Likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge .
Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; ;
The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils .
( 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present .
From the equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge .
Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil .
It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe .
and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active .
The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Af .
Introduction
Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data .
We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride .
-- Matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a tube of resublimed Af into an evacuated Pyrex system where it was condensed with liquid air .
-- The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5 mm. i.d. and about 15 cm. long .
Two types of light source were used , a thousand watt projection lamp and an AH6 high pressure mercury arc .
Results
Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings .
By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging from 11 to 18 Af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases .
-- Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate .
In series 1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm. .
Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth .
If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth .
Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material .
5.3 direct measurements of micrometeorite flux
There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment .
The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth .
these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space probes .
The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; ;
and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than Af ( Nazarova , 1960 ) .
This `` ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy .
They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater .
Of course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here .
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites .
At the fifteenth magnitude , Af , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , Af .
Indirect indications of micrometeorite flux
It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems .
Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon .
This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence .
Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics .
For example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air .
There are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne .
The smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out .
The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense .
Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated .
The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism .
The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source .
Botulinal toxin , for example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os .
In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult .
Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category .
It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent .
It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains .
All of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management .
No epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy .
A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned .
Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators .
Abelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose .
Speer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Aj .
Fahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated **yg-globulin samples .
One contained complete antibody and had a titer of 1 : 512 in saline .
This serum exhibited titers of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect Coombs test .
In several instances group O cells were also used as controls .
All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods .
Homozygous and heterozygous Af cells , Af and homozygous and heterozygous Af cells were used to test each sample ; ;
however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous Af and homozygous Af cells will be presented here .
These cells were thawed at 37-degrees-C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2% ) .
Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed .
During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2-degrees-C by surrounding the apparatus with ice .
When paper electrophoresis was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run/chamber under the conditions described above .
When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone-sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P. J. and R. S. , Fig. 1 and E. M. , Fig. 2 ) .
A sample of Fraction Af from group O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer , dialyzed against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 .
The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity .
Apart from the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor .
Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .
Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers .
It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , black-tipped little scale .
I will deal with these later on .
As we have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange .
Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them Bombus .
If we manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep .
Then , a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed .
males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season .
Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo-bumblebee '' as it is called in some European countries .
The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host .
When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment .
Thus , the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread .
After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated .
Its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species .
After all , social life in the group of the bees is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature .
The life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer , and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage .
The best chance , of course , is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth .
Felix Kopstein states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity .
It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves .
If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet .
Oliver , in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers , which I shall consider separately .
cottonmouth ( Ancistrodon ) , two years .
Carpenter's study showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two .
Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions .
every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer .
the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical South America might be responsible .
the mere piling up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop snakes , joint snakes , or ghosts .
rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; ;
R. R. Mole and F. W. Urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the Orinoco estuaries .
A difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size .
It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate .
In 1948 , Afranio Do Amaral , the noted Brazilian herpetologist , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes .
He concluded that the anaconda's maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet ( 14 meters is slightly less than 46 feet ) .
However , as a field measurement , it is open to question .
It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area .
When some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected .
The pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) .
The pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) .
Air-drifts from one area to another are , therefore , conceivable .
Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type 1 ( ( fig. 24 ) .
Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface .
This was accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery .
Also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; ;
It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made .
For example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 , and 3 .
The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries .
The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear .
In criticism of the latter's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level .
'49 ) found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats .
Ellis , Grindlay and Edwards ( '52 ) also were unable to find them in rats .
Finally , it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species .
The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented .
type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; ;
Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 .
Thus , a child's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve .
First , the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting of those from Hand , Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , and Foot .
Third , the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion .
The differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows .
The direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset .
When the `` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification used in this paper is `` Same schedule '' .
The difference between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in Figures 3 and 4 .
Thus , the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center's ability to `` catch up '' in ossification is demonstrated .
One growth center in a short bone -- distal phalanx of the second finger -- was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage .
The mean onset age was 25.3 months ( Table 1 ) , and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months .
Interestingly enough , the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 ) .
The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood .
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems .
In addition , the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine .
On chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Af and then to Af as the active iodinating species .
The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine analogues ( Pitt-Rivers and James , 1958 ) .
Secretion
A microsomal de-iodinase with a pH optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity , has been identified in the thyroid ( Stanbury , 1957 ) .
The thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream .
Antithyroid drugs are of two general types .
The most conclusively identified is L-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone , which was isolated from rutabaga ( Greer , 1950 ) .
F .
Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis .
Brown ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject .
In the last few years , the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification ( Bates and Condliffe , 1960 ; ;
Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood .
The importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 ) .
We should like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units .
For the most part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard .
In February , 1958 , the patient suffered a myocardial infarction complicated by pulmonary edema .
Additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans , and cholelithiasis .
the hemoglobin was 10.6 gm. .
Serial serum potassium levels remained normal ; ;
Extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of D8 was found .
Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied and had large , irregular , basophilic nuclei .
Macrophages laden with brown pigment were seen in some of the alveoli , and the intima of some of the small arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue .
Microscopically , the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive cytolysis and contained large numbers of Gram-negative bacterial rods .
The submucosa was focally infiltrated with neutrophils .
Microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius , pectoralis major , transversus abdominis , biceps brachii , and diaphragm showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers .
Such swollen fibers were deeply eosinophilic , contained a few pyknotic nuclei , and showed loss of cross-striations , obliteration of myofibrils , and prominent vacuolization .
Inflammatory cells were strikingly absent .
( 2 ) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems .
The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 ) .
The sections were then thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 30 minutes ; ;
until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks .
After blotting out most of the saline around the sections , a drop of Af was layered over each of the sections , allowed to react for 30 minutes , and then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes .
After blotting out most of the liquid around the sections , the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine ( 7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of PBS ) .
This specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive sections stained with 1 : 10 dilution of NS and Af or with Af alone .
When 1 ml of conjugate was passed through a column ( Af ) , the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments , and very little in others .
Direct method .
Af was first conjugated with 50 mg of FITC per gram of globulin .
Frequently a few isolated thick-walled cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the xylem region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cells , ray cells , or pith .
Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm .
A study of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm .
Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges .
Furthermore , conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed .
These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes .
Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible .
He took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established .
The feeding-pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho- and ergotropic systems .

Concluding remarks
The theorem which we prove is more general than what we have described , since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the primes which enter are all of first degree .
( primary decomposition theorem ) .
Let T be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F .
Conversely , let G be any polynomial such that Af .
Then Af .
Theorem 13 .
Now suppose that we also have Af where D' is diagonalizable , N' is nilpotent , and Af .
for , using the fact that N and N' commute Af and so when R is sufficiently large every term in this expression for Af will be 0 .
Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field F , e.g. , the field of complex numbers .
From these results , one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators .
It is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter .
In concluding this section , we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem .
Let us now regard D as a linear operator on the subspace V .
Then Af .
We now write Af where Af are distinct complex numbers .
that is , one must know something about D other than the fact that it is a linear operator .
Thus F satisfies Af if and only if F has the form Af .
In repeated sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary .
Inheritance in mice .
In litters of eight mice from similar parents , the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8 .
General binomial problem .
Fortunately , a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind .
In the marksmanship example , a trial consists of `` one round shot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's-eye ( success ) or none ( failure ) .
Mathematically , we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times .
We also give , for each property , an example where the property is absent .
Experiment without a fixed number of trials .
2 .
Binomial trials .
Each of the N trials is either a success or a failure .
Experimentally , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another .
When this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials , one for each member of the family , the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent .
Each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize .
In repetitions of the experiment from couple to couple , the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply , because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors .
Therefore , under independent voting , Af or 0.36 of the couples would cast two votes for picture A , and Af or 0.16 would cast two votes for picture B .
( For instance , see Example 2 of Section 5-5 , on red cards in hands of 5 .
that is , we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its departures from the binomial model .
We shall find a formula for the probability of exactly X successes for given values of P and N .
The choice of P and N determines the binomial distribution uniquely , and different choices always produce different distributions ( except when Af ; ;
Binomial distributions were treated by James Bernoulli about 1700 , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called Bernoulli trials .
The several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable X , the total number of successes , which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials .
Consider a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Af .
The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Af there are families of such cubes .
The set of intersections of Af , the rotated curve , with the original curve C consists of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at Af , plus the vertex itself .
The graph , as a set , may have a finite number of components .
The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve .
This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals .
A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another .
In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval .
The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af .
We suppose not .
But this is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every T .
There must be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components .
Introduction .
Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Af and Af , and let **zg be a Af curve of order K on Q .
Clearly , the transformation is involutorial .
We observe first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q .
Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj .
The invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of **zg , since each of these meets Q in two points which are invariant .
The order of this congruence is Af , since Af secants of a curve of symbol ( B ) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point .
Moreover , if Af and Af are two planes intersecting in a line l , tangent to Q at a point P , the two free intersections of the image curves Af and Af must coincide at P' , the image of P , and at this point Af and Af must have a common tangent l' .
This curve is of symbol Af since it meets **yl , and hence every line of Af in the Af invariant points on **yl and since it obviously meets every line of Af in a single point .
The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af .
In other words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all .
Clearly , any line , l , of any bundle having one of these points of tangency , T , as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of L and Q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of Af which is tangent to **zg at T .
By ( 1 ) , the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order Af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , C , of order Af .
Moreover , if Af , no two of the multiple secants can intersect .
These societies can expect to face difficult times .
As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; ;
Transitional societies
The civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; ;
Efforts such as the Community Development Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development .
as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance .
Land reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture .
Actively modernizing societies
they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; ;
Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning .
For one thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects ; ;
There are also more basic problems .
Nevertheless , impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices .
Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead more rigid and inflexible in their policies .
It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies .
Foreign policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection .
American and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition ; ;
It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark .
Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences .
Man is first religious ; ;
The chief experience is the sensing of communion , and in the higher religions , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power .
he has endless being .
Under the religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , men have joy in living ; ;
He is confronted with the recurrent crises , such as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life -- marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old age , the certainty of death .
The two have never been separable .
Even in the United States , with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values .
It places certain values at least beyond questioning and tampering .
This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends ; ;
Finally , it gives meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life .
Religion integrates and unifies .
Without a system of values there can be no society .
the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firmer the group .
The common codes , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together .
Durkheim noted long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things unites into one single moral community all those who adhere to them '' .
His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit .
The unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized .
It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones .
for example , the Crusades , mission efforts , just wars .
Religion provides the most attractive rewards , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide by its norms , but who engage in good works .
Inability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short tempers reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation .
Simultaneously , a variety of environmental supports -- a calm but not too motherly homemaker , referral for temporary economic aid , intelligent use of nursing care , accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins' feeding problem -- combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms .
The lack of awareness usually springs from deep but disguised anxiety , often assuming the superficial guise of `` not knowing '' or `` not caring '' .
Over a relatively short period of time , usually about four to twelve weeks , the worker must be able to shift the focus , back and forth , between immediate external stressful exigencies ( `` precipitating stress '' ) and the key , emotionally relevant issues ( `` underlying problem '' ) which are , often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough , reactivated by the crisis situation , and hence once again amenable to resolution .
While expensive in time and involving a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker ( in terms of his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into the client's life ) , techniques of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives .
Having outlined an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework , we now address ourselves to our final question : What place should brief , crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services ? ?
Similarities to the approach which I have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship , quick appraisal of key issues , and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses .
My aim in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy '' but rather to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess , and to use them with greater confidence , precision , and professional pride .
Ideally , brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance .
Increased experimentation with multipurpose agencies , especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare services , holds rich promise for the future .
Tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling .
The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating .
Status-roles .
Interviews with members of the Brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the ranking of the various families in the population .
A cursory survey of available material indicates a high rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous relationship .
Subsystems
The comprehensive or master processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems .
In the study of marriage patterns for this group , consanguinity produces the structural system -- a system of affinities -- which , in turn , maintains the system of consanguinity .
Each family line can be considered a substructure .
There seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group .
The present study relates to the theory of functional systems .
In order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension , the high fertility rate provides more group members for mate selection , and the clustering of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls .
Integration `` has to do with the inter-relation of parts '' .
The problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values .
Socialization
Institutionalization Though undoubtedly all six processes are operative within the whole social system and its subsystems , two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be singled out for particular emphasis .
Communication may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger community .
Although the Brandywine population is still predominantly rural , `` there are indications of a consistent and a statistically significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities .
In the urban area , in other words , they , unlike some urban ethnic groups , do not concentrate in ghetto colonies .
There is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society .
Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 .
Tribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials .
Each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned , including his or her date of birth ( or age at a specified time ) , spouses , and children .
So a quick count could be made at any time , even by an illiterate clerk , of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes .
Personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments , inoculations , periods of employment , and changes of residence are recorded .
Similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females .
Each adult is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand .
In addition , demographic inquiries , supposedly involving field investigations , were conducted in selected minor divisions ( circonscriptions ) containing about 3 percent of the total population .
So the results are subject to considerable confusion .
Before considering more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of demography in Belgian Africa .
L'Institut pour La Recherche Scientifique En Afrique Centrale ( IRSAC ) has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has cooperated closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development of its official statistics .
The radical nature of the innovation in the Congo was not emphasized in the official announcements .
These are as follows : ( 1 ) field work procedures .
( 2 ) nature of the sample .
( 4 ) questions and definitions .
It is still used in making current population estimates in post-census years , though the value of these estimates is open to question .
In their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time .
( 1 ) The regular sections do not allow freshmen ; ;
By permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it .
One might digress at this point and speculate that if it is `` wise '' to create special sections for special status , then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage , and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children , and so on .
He made it clear from the beginning that this was the students' opportunity , and that the future destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one .
The writer , being cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students , did insist on there being included some `` hindsight '' material .
Or `` How do we enrich our already fine marriage '' ? ?
They began to meet in the evenings and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class .
In addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles , there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read .
In short , it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy .
These were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them .
Guilford-Martin ; ;
Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects .
Only Co differentiated between the two groups at less than the 5% level ( Af ) .
individual differences
Only 27% ( 11 subjects ) gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon .
They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors .
She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial , but had consciously prevented it from so doing .
but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation .
She then described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she relinquished control .
Aniseikonic illusion
Yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be .
For purposes of sample selection only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade population in each school system .
Over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system .
Reliability and validation work with the Children's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda , et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale .
The issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later .
The relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact ( in this case , Af ) ; ;
The criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement .
It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I.Q. .
Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable .
As predicted , the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( Af ) than those in the structured schools .
Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting .
For example : a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying .
In place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires , checking their references , interviewing them , asking them to be tried out , he told them he would prefer to test them .
The batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three .
From the point of view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated -- and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances .
Another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work .
Analysis
The engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard worker , was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a `` comer '' .
Entirely concerned with efficiency , he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes , condemning them to too great an extent .
He did not really listen to others , had little interest in their ideas , and wanted to have his own way -- which was the only right way .
The engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life -- and refused to change it .
In any case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made over .
In a course for supermarket operators , a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager , found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time .
On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior -- he answered : `` I have to make decisions .
How this was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem .
They were asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; ;
While roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure .
Eventually such incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny '' ? ?
What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like .
Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor sufferer again on the morrow .
This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on the one hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others , and on the other hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair -- in short , behaving as if I owned her room .
More than anything , it is the therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck of cards , on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together .
To a much less full extent , the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; ;
Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic-sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene .
Recently , for example , a paranoid woman's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid-twentieth-century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was .
We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem .
Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists of three steps .
The formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form .
Thus , when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form .
similarly , as many cells are added as are required .
The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time .
The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe .
The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms .
This leaves the ordering of entries variable .
( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it .
The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage .
Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context .
Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form .
in who's a linguist ? it will generally be on the complement a linguist .
Dominant stress is on her luggage both in that's her luggage , where her luggage is the complement , and in there's her luggage , where it is the subject .
Adverbial second complements , however , are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences .
They are likely to lose dominant stress .
What is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not .
but if George has just been mentioned prominently ( and the trip to be made has been under discussion ) , what is said is probably I'll go with him , and dominant stress is probably on the preposition with .
the personal pronoun has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously .
In there aren't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious .
Dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here .
Thus in his friends are stranger than his sisters' strong stresses are normal for his and sisters' , but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters .
Thus in Mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on Mary marks Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip , strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of Mary's concerned with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have made speeches , for example ) , and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which Mary wrote accounts .
The stress on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper , is quite strong .
In Mack's the leader at camp , but Jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents is the leader and therefore has stress .
In of all the suggestions that were made , his was the silliest the possessive his represents his suggestion and is stressed .
In to tell him , of course , to is normally unstressed .
In the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language ; ;
It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels .
Actually , none of these papers says much directly about field techniques .
This can only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general .
Welmers has suggested one explanation .
This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable .
However , any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded .
Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way ; ;
But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages .
In the `` typical tone language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics .
The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater .
There has been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance .
Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs .
His objective is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 ) .
His orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other .
He concludes that some changes can be made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes .
But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology .
On the whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter .
This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early A Short Description Of Item-Categories In Iraqw .
What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body parts and products , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 terms out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come out with nearly even ratios ; ;
( 2 ) Nature ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ;
Hoijer's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly , big-large , long-far , many-much , die-dead , say-speak ) .
and Af stems .
which , divided by Af gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart .
In 1960 , David D. Thomas published Basic Vocabulary In some Mon-Khmer Languages ( AL 2 , No. 3 , pp. 7 - 11 ) , which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( Af ) in place of original ( Af ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards Greater Accuracy ( IJAL 21 : :
121 - 137 ) .
Thomas' findings are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; ;
These findings , and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry .
Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller .
It is evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items .
Why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list ? ?
And why that insistence ? ?
and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities .
That is his privilege .
of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; ;
of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in Athabascan , in Yokuts , in Uto-Aztecan in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them .
This involves step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry .
If of the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve .
`` You would drive us into shame '' , he declared .
However , there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong Poland , both industrially and agriculturally , and one unplagued by large minorities of Germans or Russians .
Of more importance to the West than Poland's boundaries was the character of her government .
It is in Russia's interest that Poland should be strong and powerful , in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force .
In doing so Marshall and Byrnes were `` asking for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international life '' .
First is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion .
All political interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination .
The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time .
In January , 1958 , the Minister of the Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer .
The choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections .
Although the elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates .
The Istiqlal-sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union Marocaine Des Commercants , Industrialistes et Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union National Des Forces Populaires ) in nearly all urban centers .
The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years .
Apart from some areas of recurring trouble , like Bani Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process .
There were three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates .
Voter registration began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960 .
The government was most anxious that there be a respectable response .
There were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking .
Some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities .
Current programs
Annual authorizations of $15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians .
Throughout the history of the program , state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all together have spent more than either Federal or state governments .
National defense considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades .
No comparable measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training .
Vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers , but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills .
Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts .
but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted .
They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas .
Few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry .
Local focus of programs
Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys .
The U. S. Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys .
No effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained .
There simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable .
Proposals
State and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities .
Again , one major difficulty is the local focus .
His aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training .
But briefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences .
They are both trend-following methods .
Of course , many more things are charted besides prices .
And the public minus the `` public '' leaves the so-called `` sophisticated '' element -- the element on the other end of the `` public's '' transactions .
They are able to sit more patiently with what they have bought .
The usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis as well , declines in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use .
Diametric opposition must persist as to the future course of prices , if there is to persist a market at all .
And the few must win what the many lose , for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all , and is , in fact , unimaginable .
Mr. John Magee , whose work has been discussed in this chapter , was quoted in a New Yorker Magazine profile as saying : `` Of course , you have to remember it's a good thing for us chartists that there aren't more of us .
The method would become self-defeating '' .
Thus while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed , it is commonplace for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed .
the hoaxes
The tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident .
At this time , however , there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction .
The recovery will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit , as well as by an expansion of Government spending , well sustained consumer spending , and some rebuilding of business inventories .
However , the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow of gold , as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy , which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle .
The principle of `` bills only '' , or `` bills preferably '' , seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term Government securities .
By the end of the spring of 1961 , assuming that a general business recovery gets under way , interest rates should begin to edge upward again , depending upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to restrain credit availability .
Moreover , it is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country , to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs , will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education , housing , medical aid , and the like .
According to the latest projections of the Bureau of the Census , the annual rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years .
The average annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1,525,000 in the three-year period from April 1947 to March 1950 .

With the expansion of family formation in the Sixties , a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated .
This is an area in which there is still a large backlog of demand .

The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries .
For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages .
A .
The form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of Aj .
The extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase .
D .
Union policies and collective bargaining issues
The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here .
We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate .
Changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices .
In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise .
The presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously .
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow .
Thus , theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere .
Of course it had always been of European origin in fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory .
It reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes .
In the international community this reduced law to Jellinek's auto-limitation .
Government itself was based upon contract ; ;
Serious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process .
This saved for state adjudication , in the first instance , the two major areas where federal injunctions had been most obnoxious , but other areas remained vulnerable .
In Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern Ry. Co. , the commission had refused to permit abandonment of certain `` uneconomic '' train facilities .
this in the name of equitable discretion .
The Taft-Hartley Act gave the federal courts jurisdiction over `` suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce '' .
On its face this merely provides a federal forum ; ;
In short , congressional power to grant federal-question authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need not create , or specify , the right to be enforced .
The Lincoln Mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal `` common law '' which , as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in dissent , leads to one of the following `` incongruities '' : `` ( ( 1 ) conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining agreements ; ;
With a few exceptions , the lawmakers seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved -- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges .
To avoid these constitutional difficulties , Mr. Justice Frankfurter was prepared to read the Taft-Hartley provision as concerned with diversity , rather than federal question , jurisdiction .
This would satisfy what presumably was Congress' major purpose -- the suability of unions .
The same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in the FELA certiorari cases , in the administrative law area , and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review .
We consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial federal-state relationship .
A similar canon applies to those who press state claims in federal tribunals , e.g. , in diversity cases .
In other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the pleader by state law .
But the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the State exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it , so long as a requirement does not add to , or diminish , the right as defined by Federal law , nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities of litigation '' .
How else can one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381(c)(9) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ;
or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381(c)(6) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ;
Exceptions are often classified as transfers by `` operation of law '' .
Proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be filed .
The Ruling would not , however , apply to an acquisition of assets for cash .
In these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote .
In the rare case where a corporation's only substantial asset , or its most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps its transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock .
Section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis for property transferred , and section 1223 provides for tacking on the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee .
Since this type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was enacted in 1954 , one cannot say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have .
Information for classifying respondents ( Part A of the questionnaire ) 2 .
Respondents' opinions regarding negotiated bidding ( Part F of the questionnaire ) 7 .
It is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves .
C .
This test resulted in further revisions of the questionnaire .
Twenty-eight returns in all were received .
Where possible , the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address .
The remaining names were then checked against the Thomas Register list ( see below ) and duplicate names were removed from the AIA lists .
It was compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the Aerospace Industries Association were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs .
3 .
The control sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical listing of manufacturers in the Thomas Register .
If the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified , the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted .
Mailing the questionnaire
Each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm .
The methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in Appendix Aj .
By virtue of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces .
We have consoled ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding .
They were inadequately financed , without experienced leadership , and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole .
This past year the pattern has been different : The organizing program had the full support of the AFL-CIO , which supplied staff and money to the AWOC , as well as moral support .
Primarily , we became involved in these disputes because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program .
Most of us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser Act in its historical sense , as a major milestone in the development of public placement services .
However , when labor disputes arise , its provisions come clearly into play .
We found that a labor dispute existed , and that the workers had left their jobs , which were then vacant because of the dispute .
Accordingly , under clause ( 1 ) of the Secretary's Regulation , we suspended referrals to the employer .
First , let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved .
Thus far , the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike -- condition ( 1 ) in the Regulation of the Secretary .
Because of the uncertainty of this definition , I solicited the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor .

more effective solutions include explanations , the example of another child , or conditioning by associating the feared object , place , or person with something pleasant .
Although no national norms exist for the social development of children , the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels .
The following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children ; ;
such factors as sex , intelligence , and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time .
During early childhood boys tease and bully , on the average , more than girls ; ;
girls , who are more mature than boys , frown upon the youthful antics of boys of their own age .
7 .
after the fourth year it begins to decline .
The child in the primary grades can play harmoniously with one companion , but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger ; ;
In the middle grades , however , he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader , helping to make plans and carry on group activities , and setting up rules governing the enterprise .
Much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children , yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program .
others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom .
One study , which involved 1,524 pupils in grades one to six , found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity .
Teaching methods , learning materials , and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to maladjustments for some children .
Successful teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment .
These records , when systematically maintained , provide much information about the children , which the teacher can use in guidance , instruction , grouping , and reporting to parents .
The Middle-South Region , as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials ( NAIRO ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia .
The states and the Nation's Capital all have some desegregation , in fact some dating back to 1954 ; ;
thus , county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation .
Desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by Negro plaintiffs against school boards in Newport News , Fairfax County , Arlington County , and Norfolk .
Knowledge that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow .
In fact , short of fleeing to Warrenton , Virginia , or Rockville , Maryland , white people may have to live with Negroes .
Second , as we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves , how can we achieve this action through school board action ? ?
Correlatively , can we reduce the role of the district courts , so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court ? ?
Third , how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools ? ?
Issue no. 1 .
Pupil assignment .
On the other hand , looking at the larger picture , is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off , blocked , or reduced school desegregation to a `` trickle '' ? ?
We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation .
Withholding of funds to schools that deny children on account of race .
Is public education in this American democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education ? ?
If the above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens , Issue No. 6 may be moot .
Nearly half the children still receive no education .
On the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way .
There have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy .
Do they make class-biased decisions ? ?
The answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's own social-class position and also upon his social history , as well as upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator .
Their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers .
But another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social advancement .
They generally vote so as to serve their own constituency , and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class , they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests in education .
Generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society , as they conceive it .
Thus , the Commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education .
Finally there are the parent organizations and the laymen's organizations such as the National Association of Parents and Teachers , and the Citizens Committee on Public Schools .
But there is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education .
They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society .
Both of these purposes exist side by side without much overt conflict under present conditions .
It is probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade , because the scholarship programs mainly aided the students with the best academic records ( who were usually middle-class ) , and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges .
The double-step type
But in any event , full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ;
2 .
It might be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases .
Here no attempt is made , first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs `` reasonably distributed '' residues of total costs .
For a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output ( or consumption ) of energy .
The simplest division , and the one most frequently used ( with subdivisions ) in gas and electric rate cases , is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' , `` energy '' or `` volumetric costs '' , and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs .
per kilowatt-hour , and a $2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 per kilowatt -- a total bill of $8 for that month .
Let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn , recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes ; ;
This push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word `` mass '' to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied .
For if the small group notion involves the implicit claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic or subatomic proportions , the philosopher needs to know the extent to which such entities are valid .
The mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation .
This involves a sifting of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement .
Horowitz 1957b .
Science is mocked for wishing to know nothing of Nothing , in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense of men .
In the new situation , philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences , a reservoir of logical relations that can be used in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value .
Likewise , Kant formulated the nebular hypothesis , according to which the solar system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas , nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by Laplace in his Systeme Du Monde .
This does not mean that philosophy resolves the problems it generates , any more so than Riemann's geometry settled the physical status of the space-time continuum .
For some forms of philosophy , this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter .
( cf. McGlynn : 1958 .
Philosophic systems , by the very nature of their completeness , are overthrown by rival systems .
In addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysics , they differ in that science is essentially descriptive , while philosophy in its inherited forms , tends to be goal-oriented , teleological and prescriptive .
I think it must be said that , contrary to metaphysical insistence , these are questions so framed as to defy either empirical exploration or rational solutions .
As Simmel ( 1908 ) and Dilthey ( 1922 ) indicated , questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions , but assertions of faith made to appear as legitimate questions .
An operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty , since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either replaces or reshapes .
Uncertainty overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise information about the world .
I hold , on the contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it was bad -- bad when and as it occurred .
For what I express in my remark is something going on in me at the time , and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene .
Indeed , we should say , on the contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal's pain , that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not .
It ideally removes the past event , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds it should not .
If we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred ? ?
So far as I can see , there is only one way out for the positivist .
He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval .
This way of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so far as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it .
the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling .
and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is , as we say , quite dead .
It is as empty as the word `` Hurrah '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it .
We should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it was the same point we were making .
In his novel The House Of The Dead , Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison camp .
Whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today , Dostoevsky's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined .
Would condemnation be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn ? ?
In such a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point .
If goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line .
To greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; ;
it would bring goodness into the world .
This circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever .
( 1 ) What allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed ? ?
( 2 ) What evidence is there that he was psychically blind ? ?
First of all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged ? ?
And he could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; ;
As one would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference .
Dice , for example , he inferred from black dots on a white surface .
If the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations , at least in regard to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors .
The authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned away from the object concerned ) .
a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century .
The ninth century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated .
The Aegean in 800 B.C.
Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times -- granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside -- are correct ; ;
but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first millennium .
The same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages .
To interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; ;
Chapter 5 the early eighth century
Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; ;
Since writing was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful .
the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress .
The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie in the Aegean past .
The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; ;
Ripe Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited .
Painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; ;
While talking with Julian M. Beall , Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away .
Finding him dead , Cook caught Russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins .
The posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive .
When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer , taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside , square against the muzzle of a Winchester .
The 1946 town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center , Depot , and Way's Lane .
The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report .
The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities .
In 1846 Matthew B. Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' .
In 1879 the same Clark Wait , with H. H. Holley of South Dorset , formed the `` American Telegraph Line '' , extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and South Dorset to Dorset .
Besides being most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners '' .
Telegraphers at the Depot at this time were Aaron C. Burr and Mark Manley of `` Burr and Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry goods .

In 1914 when the town was chosen for the U. S. Amateur Golf tournament , a representative hurried here from the Boston manager's office .
During summers , business was so brisk that Mrs. Wilcox had two assistants and a messenger .
After being located for some years in the Village at the Equinox Pharmacy under the supervision of Mrs. Harry Mercier , it is presently located in the Hill and Dale Shop , Manchester Center .
A small single switchboard was installed in the Village over Woodcock's hardware store ( later E. H. Hemenway's ) .
Anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the Manchester Journal .
This was working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service .
First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' .
we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; ;
But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials .
Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite .
Utopian communism applies to all Utopians .
Finally , the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time , although it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the Middle Ages .
When we give the necessities of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs .
In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role .
New , indeed , is Luther's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at .
Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; ;
During the Brown trial , however , the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments .
The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states '' .
The two major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history .
On November 7 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal reprinted a letter sent to John Brown from `` E. B. '' , a Quaker lady in Newport .
During the latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution , it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in `` E. B.'s '' suggestion .
A week later the Daily Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution .
Seated on the platform were Amos C. Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; ;
Thomas Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; ;
The first speaker was Amos C. Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting .
Woodbury's remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing .
The fourth and last speaker was Thomas Davis .
He said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments .
that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface .
Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas .
It is true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque's , which would confirm the date he assigns it .
When we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each .
But here again , the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim .
And the surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast .
In the upper center of Braque's first collage , Fruit Dish ( in Douglas Cooper's collection ) , a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane .
And the same thing , more or less , can be said of the contents of Picasso's first collage .
In later collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of .
The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a painted-in form -- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth .
All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it .
Flatness may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself -- at least an optical if not , properly speaking , a pictorial illusion .
they had also had to generalize it -- to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself .
( This provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality '' .
But they deny the values of the city -- the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting pot '' which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities .
In most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated .
No suburban shopping-center branch -- not even Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit -- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store .

Suburbs and Negroes
Constantino Brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure .
It was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks , and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older artists' preparation , with a mortar , one part slaked lime , three parts sand , to be put on in two layers .
When it was all arranged to fit , and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze , the cartoons were tried in place .
Some of the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us ; ;
Lime white , hard and brilliant , has a tendency to `` jump '' away from the other colors in drying , and also by its capacity to set , to preclude the use of ready-made gradations , so useful in decorative work .
We were forced , as they were , to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark areas .
Whosever fault , it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his `` histories '' and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of California gold .
In painting a fresco , the handling of wet mortar compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right , not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering .
The photograph , Figure 1 of the completed frieze , shows how , having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years , he has now been given a hand , and by juxtaposition ( and the permission of the Committee ) , given a new job , to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 .
One man sprayed , with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting .
The painting `` a fresco '' stood up superbly ; ;
The greatest source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings above , soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime , very conspicuous even after cleaning , particularly in the `` Landing of Columbus '' , `` Oglethorpe and the Indians '' , and `` Yorktown '' .
This letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful .
It is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the Union of Soviet Artists .
Nevertheless I consider it reasonable , because of my commitment as an artist , to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific geo-political interests .
That which I found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction .
Apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen objectively , or at least dispassionately , to individual impressions of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments .
Artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends of humanity ; ;
The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit .
This kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to .
Instead , we became involved in a series of friendly , but overly formal , welcoming addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind .
She did not go so far as to say , as was done on other occasions , that Abstraction as well as Impressionism were a Russian invention that had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the U.S.S.R.
Our presence here should also be considered further , sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer , peaceful ties among all people .
Its scope is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society ? ?
It is a simple matter , for one so disposed , to take a work like The Sane Society and shred it into odds and ends .
It would come down to saying that Fromm paints with a broad brush , and that , after all , is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the outset .
There are more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account of capitalist civilization .
Almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation .
The idea has received much attention in philosophy , in literature , and in a few works of general social criticism , such as The Sane Society .
Until such evidence appears , we must make do with the evidence we have .
Fromm seems unaware of these developments .
Another example is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topics : he cites such survey-type findings just three times .
Eric Hoffer , for example , once said that America was a paradise -- the only one in the history of the world -- for workingmen and small children .
and today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view .
`` Are people happy , are they as satisfied , unconsciously , as they believe themselves to be ? ?
Sometimes he uses it as a subjective , descriptive term , and sometimes as an objective , diagnostic one .
Of course , the list also excludes all writers who are fairly `` optimistic '' about the modern situation ; ;
Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections .
Even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities , defined with economical precision .
His calmness offers contrast to Grigori's youthful excitement .
A quiet but sturdy theme , somewhat folklike in character , appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life :
Varlaam is loud , rowdy , uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same .
a clever naturalistic touch is Varlaam's labored reading of the warrant .
in spite of the Italian name , he sounds French .
Curiously , this scene is a close parallel to one that Verdi was writing at the same time , the scene between Amonasro and Aida .
As if in a trance , she repeats his words -- then realizes , with a shock , her own audacity .
Now Rangoni comes to the point , and we hear , for the first time , a long , downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power .
Her pride is as much at stake as her virtue ; ;
Indignantly she denounces Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her .
With another sudden change of mood , he is again calm and protective , exhorting her to trust and obey him as God's spokesman -- and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction .
We have a brief glimpse of the Tsar's public personality , the `` official Boris '' , but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd -- a significant contrast with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene , its bitter resentment and fury in the final act .
Even in its most conventional appearance , the guests' song of praise to Marina , there are a few female dissenters criticizing the princess for her coldness .
The opening scene shows this method at its most individual .
They echo the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who `` trembles and begs for mercy -- and there is no mercy '' .
They bring the news that the Pretender has been excommunicated ; ;
These dates are virtually the only clues we have to the chronology of the poems , since the separate volumes are neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other .
Satires Of Circumstance and Moments Of Vision , coming during his most productive decade , are relatively self-contained ; ;
but resumed it later '' ) .
and on Christmas Day , 1890 , Hardy wrote : `` While thinking of resuming ' the viewless Wings Of Poesy before dawn this morning , new horizons seemed to open , and worrying pettinesses to disappear '' ( Early Life , p. 302 ) .
Almost anyone could have written it ; ;
it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form , but it is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike Hardy .
The poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic sources of diction , yet it is obviously not ordinary speech -- only Hardy would say `` a grin of bitterness swept thereby ; ;
In the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world ; ;
they compose a painful elegy to what might have been , to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness , and ended in long years of suffering and hatred .
The poems are , the epigraph tells us , the `` traces of an ancient flame '' ; ;
Both of them were my friends .
Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end .
As artists , they were very similar .
Neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture at his own creativity .
I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value .
I think all this could apply to Parker just as well , although , because of the nature of music , it is not demonstrable -- at least not conclusively .
This is true of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody -- Benny Carter , Johnny Hodges .
The metaphysical conceits , which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still dominant in backwater American colleges , were embroideries .
The immediate theme , if it exists , is incidental , and his main theme -- the terror of birth -- is simply reiterated .
Partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication .
It is much more a personal difference .
I want to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts .
There is just more to Tiepolo .
Yet certain aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without a pause .
Even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition .
This observation too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry .
To the extent that a language is formulaic , its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other cliches .
If the master of scops who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional , he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements .
Time-servers , though the periphrastic expressions are , they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous .
in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus , and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation .
Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem ; ;
no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of Heorot or the palace of Priam .
In Coriolanus the agnomen of Marcius is used deliberately and pointedly , but the Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the hearer `` a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent '' .
If Cynewulf was literate , the Beowulf poet may have been also , and so may the final redactor of The Iliad and The Odyssey .
In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative .
Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in Great Expectations , as in no other of Dickens' novels , hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme -- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them .
later he flees in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which he has brought to Gargery's forge for mending .
It is the similarity between Estella's hands and Molly's ( `` The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting '' ) that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of Satis House .
But only in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , revenge , and retribution .
Since a gentleman must , if possible , avoid sullying them by work , his hands , as importantly as his accent , become the index of social status .
When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give me your blackened hand '' ! !
In both cases the finger-post represents Pip's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms .
Pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self-aggrandizement .

It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume .
For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1 .
The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate .
Initially , the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period .
A single 24-hr. composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical .
The BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision .
The BOD in the effluent averaged 58 mg/l , a 76-per-cent reduction over the 24-hr. period .
Examination of the data in Table 1 , shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent Aj .
It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system .
The flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1 .
The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6 days , averaging 6.4 days .
A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids .
It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active microbial solids with the heavier , less active solids settling out .
Oxygen transfer
One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator .
The data given in Table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator .
The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961 .
The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0-mg. / l. dissolved oxygen concentration and 10-degrees-C for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3 .
The organic loading on the pond was slightly under 60 lb. BOD / day / acre .
Surface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations , air to furnish area surveillance , and mines for protection of limited areas .
The submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas .
Consequently , air , surface , and submarine elements overshadow the mine , fixed installations , and intelligence .
Each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others .
It would allow presentation to the public of a unified approach .
The result can only be confusion in the public mind .
Therefore , a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for co-ordination of the Navy's efforts , for a logical presentation to the public , for industry's guidance , and as a basis for a program to the Congress .
Principles involved in an over-all concept
The Communists are adept at utilizing hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage .
The submarine has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since World War 2 .
Therefore , the plan's fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of all elements in combination .
The world is constantly changing ; ;
Supporting elements in asw operations
Since effective area coverage appears fairly remote , the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements : air , surface , sub-surface , fixed installations , mines , and intelligence .
These are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result .
In submarine defense these must have maximum stress .
Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets .
they are difficult to counter , cost little to maintain until required , and can be put into place quickly .
For example , effective mine barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the Yucatan Channel from Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense , inshore patrol , convoy escort , shipping control , and mine defense for the entire Gulf of Mexico .
Such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically .
No general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined .
The submarine has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system .
It operates in its target's environment , and any advantage gained therefrom by the target is shared by the attacker .
Fragment A has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt and free base .

trace elements in tektites , meteorites , and related materials
The silicate fractions of stony meteorites show gallium / germanium ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone melting at some point in their histories .
Libyan Desert silica-glass , another natural glass , is composed of nearly pure silica and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area .
No meteorites have ever been recovered from paleoexplosion craters , and recent craters containing impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception of Aouelloul crater , Adrar , Western Sahara Desert .

Recent work with radiocarbon and deuterated alcohols as solvents , however , has given evidence that metal-hydrido and carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction with alcohol in some of these systems .
While ATP appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction , its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction .
The predictability of the molecular weights was found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared , with Af ratios less than 1.1 .

However , the proposed correlation of the many interrelated properties of crystals will reveal discrepancies in the recorded data and suggest areas for reinvestigation .
In this way a degree of unification of nomenclature , symbols , and units will be realized .
In earlier years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival .
Food treated in this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration .
The process of `` pasteurization '' involves milder and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction of most , but not all , of the microorganisms .
The radiation doses required for the preservation of foods are in the following ranges : 1 .
3 .
For destruction of insects -- about 25,000 Aj .
A number of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and palatability , however , at dosages substantially less than sterilization levels .
Radiation sources
Selection of a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate , load factor , throughput , convenience , safety , and most important , costs .
Such projections , however , appear highly speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond those foreseen for food-preservation facilities .
Present status of irradiation preservation of foods
Thus , food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability .
When lamb and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses , the meat becomes dehydrated , the fat becomes chalky , and , again , unnatural changes in color occur .
Ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration , and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities .
The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal .
Since the removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness .
At low thicknesses a cutting ( or shearing ) phenomenon is often encountered .
The molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface .
What then , are the factors that contribute to these phenomena ? ?
It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure .
Consequently , both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process .
If the cutting force , Af , is plotted against film thickness , a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope Af .
Blunt knife
One of these is the fact that the knife employed , no matter how well sharpened , will have a slightly rounded cutting edge .
Chipping mechanism of cohesive failure
By studying high speed movies made of this type of failure , the sequence of relationships as schematically illustrated in Fig. 9 could be observed .
The cracking mechanism
Most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets .
Furniture upholstery , as just one example , can easily take millions of pounds ; ;
foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer ; ;
and use of the foam for garment interlining is only now getting off the ground , with volume potential in the offing .
These are still in wide use today , particularly in semi-rigid formulations , for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural panels , foamed-in-place insulation , automotive safety padding , arm rests , etc. .
The polyether glycols are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which is much desired in cushioning .
This latter figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average of 5.5 lb. / cu. ft. in commercial grades .
Graph in Fig. 1 , p. 392 , indicates how the ratio of compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or decreased .
In temperature resistance , this quality is usually related to specific properties , e.g. , flexural , tensile strengths , etc. .
Thermal conductivity is directly traceable to the material's porous , air-cell construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which form its composition .
These air or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal barriers .
Note that flexural strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density , nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another .
Tensile strength :
) Exceptional tensile strength is another of urethane foam's strong features .
The convoluted sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically .
Molding
Only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market .
Satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether foams were never fully achieved .
When all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs .
These tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate dimensional changes after repeated launderings .
Table 1 , summarizes all of the various washing , drying , and restoration procedures available .
For example Test 3 , E 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed by procedure `` 3 ( '' ( at 160-degrees-F ) for a total of 60 minutes in the machine , has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure `` E '' and has been subjected to restorative forces on the Tension Presser by procedure `` 1 '' .
Apparatus and materials
wash wheel -- cylindrical wash wheel of the reversing type .
A domestic automatic washer that will give equivalent results may be used .
Screen drying racks -- 16-mesh screening ( Saran or Velon ) .
Test specimens
Specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with a standard atmosphere of Af and Af and then laid out without tension on a flat , polished surface , care being taken that the fabric is free from wrinkles or creases .
Usually , the greater the original distances marked , the greater will be the accuracy of the test .
Woven fabrics to be dried by procedure b ( flat-bed pressed ) or restored by procedure 3 ( hand ironing ) :
Measure and record .
The washing procedures are summarized in Table 2 .
Refill the machine to a level of Af inches with water at 100 - 109-degrees-F ( ( 38 - 43*0 C. ) and start the machine .
Drain off the soap solution of the suds cycle at such a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of soap and water at the end of the time shown in Column A of Table 2 , , measured from the time the wash wheel was started .
When this water level has been reached , inject steam until the temperature is that shown in Column Aj .
Channel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ;
However , the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain .
However , electrostatic focus , important for many applications , has not been realized for these devices .
These tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members .
Therefore , we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes .
Measured performance characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed .
Af is standard visibility function .
packing efficiency ( F.R. ) .
As the index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces of the SbCs-type lies around 2 , the Fresnel losses at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent and the Af factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95 .
It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further .
For circular fibers in a closely packed hexagonal array , the packing efficiency is given by : Af where Af , and 0.906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the circumscribed hexagon .
The cladding thickness is about 0.5 M , hence , Af and Af .
It must be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a ( mica ) membrane , in addition to an optical output lens system .
Neglecting absorption , the end losses of the coupling membrane and the output window Af would be 6 percent and 8 percent .
Gain of fiber coupled image intensifiers
Furthermore , the chromatic aberrations depend on the chosen high voltage .
The luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from Eq. ( 6 ) for the 16 possible combinations of S-11 and S-20 photocathodes and P-11 and P-20 phosphor screens , for night light and P-20 light input .
An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product .
( 3 )
then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order Af ( where a is some number not unreasonably large ) .
this number will be of the order of Af .
But Af is vastly larger than R .
It appears in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital computer .
These will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream , so that stage R is the T stage from the end .
We write this Af .
This transformation is uniquely determined by Af and we therefore speak of the process as deterministic .
In practical situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions , and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set S .
The objective function , which is to be maximized , is some function , usually piecewise continuous , of the product state .
An optimal policy is an admissible policy Af which maximizes the objective function P .
Let Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af .
When it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af .
Then Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af and the integration over the whole of stage space .
The type of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here , except that now the fourth column is redundant .
If the polarities are correct , the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero .
A mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in Fig. 7-2 .
Finally , the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by Af .
With these factors included , an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations .
It must be noticed in Fig. 7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration .
Practical leveling considerations .
The system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits .
If high accuracy is required in preflight leveling , it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs ( this also minimizes the noise problem ) .
Platform heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator .
With the gyro-stabilized platform leveled , it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques .
Before the accelerometers are mounted on the platform , the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined .
The platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers .

His parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University Hospital -- Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family -- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty much as he chose -- provided , of course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating .
His teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that , if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term .

Scotty looked at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull .
Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere .
He ate what he felt like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow , dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral .
His energy was gone .
He would sit , slim-waisted and spare , on the edge of Scotty's bed , his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor .
He could now but the weakness is very definite ; ;

Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line .

But it had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived -- servants and laborers huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime .
It had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town , black and white , knew of it .
It spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion .
It sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor .
It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting .
The audience did not think much of the new pastor , and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say .
She soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository .
Meanwhile , the city itself should be talked to .
the other exclusively Negro .
Wilson inquired about it .
But nevertheless it looked respectable .
He was glad to have it there .
In fact , he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here -- to make a larger contribution of dollar money .
But he told Wilson to `` go ahead and try '' .
It did seem impossible .
Hope to see you again '' .
And he dismissed the colored pastor .
Good wages , patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes .
The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr. Verdi .
Like the bell at Mass , the doorbell was pitched too high .
Young Frederick Seward held out his hand .
`` I will go '' .
He was merely clearing a way to what he had to do .
Payne hacked at their arms .
There was a lady there , in a nightdress .
When the knife went into his chest , he went down at once .
The clammy air revived him .
Herold , he saw , had fled .
He unhitched his horse , walked it away , mounted , and spurred it on .
He rode on and on .
After some time he came to an open field .
On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual .
That was one of the high spots of the play .
It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience , as that they had been stunned already .
Said Trenchard , otherwise Hawk .
His speech faltered .
Mrs. Lincoln screamed .
It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do .
Mrs. Lincoln screamed again .
In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water .
Someone opened the corridor door from the inside , and called for a doctor .
With incredible ferocity , he brought his fists together and struck .
He could feel his own feet , iron-shod , striking repeatedly until the body was limp .
He heard himself chortling .
`` Stevie ! !
He was safe in his Mama's arms .
Houses winked as the cars rolled beside a little depot .
The trainman called .
He put his head out .
There was the slate roof of the church ; ;
The clock which had struck presented an innocent face .
The spire seemed to hold up the sky .
The veterans , idling on their benches in the Square , beneath the soldiers' monument , got to their feet when Papa approached : `` Morning , Reverend '' ! !
His being and His will -- Stevie could not divide God from his Papa -- illumined every parish face , turned the choir into a band of angels , and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven .
When Papa went out to do God's work , Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy , which was drawn by Violet , the new black mare .
Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse -- `` Afternoon , Reverend '' ! !
Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing youth : `` Idle recreation '' ! !
He was torn between the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging northward on the Monticello Branch .
Stevie was constantly slipping into the church .
He pulled with all his strength at the heavy , brass-bound door , and shuffled along the wainscoted wall .
Perhaps one day He will choose you as He chose me , long ago .
Stevie had heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble .
For he feared the Lake of Fire .
He would hear the Call and would run to tell Papa .
Probably , as in Scriptures , a still , small voice would whisper .
Lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner ! !
He clenched his fists and faced the terror .
He would save her .
Drenched and shaking , he stood near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle .
The pointed shadow had nearly touched him .
Ludie did as he pleased .
Ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot at crows .
That Ludie ! !
He , too , cocked his cap at a jaunty angle , jingled marbles in his pocket , and swaggered down Main Street .
A Newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size .
If the crummy bastard could write ! !
What I have to put up with ! !
Sonuvabitch , I can't figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for .
One of his favorites : `` Guitar Boogie '' .
He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a POW began .
Before him , mutilated , bleeding to death , they lay .
It was as if it had been done .
But it didn't .
And he took heart ; ;
Now he heard it , fully ; ;
His old self .
The music arrived , taking him its rhythm .
Damn good .
Jesus , the guy says he is trying .
Jesus ! !
Top dog , sleeping and eating right there with the Staff .
`` Boy , you're stirrin early '' , a sleepy voice said .
All he does is to bullshit with his squad , and they are the stupidest bastards around .
Plenty of room there now .
All those dumb 8-Balls croaked .
Anything .
See , he's already snapping it up , the dumb jerk .
There was a hell of a noise this time of morning .
The whole fucken sky's caved in ! !
How ? ?
C'mon -- 'mon ! !
But he was not .
Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ? ?
Why should he be concerned ? ?
When finally the two bedraggled men reach their friend's home , Voltaire's fears are once again aroused .
Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it , Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera .
`` Nonsense '' , he said .
`` This is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away '' ! !
Well , yes , perhaps in literature , since you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself .
He couldn't appear as a composer now .
The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded .
The ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him .
That would certainly be paradoxical .
But Duclos thought he saw a way out .
And thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks .
`` I refused '' , Duclos said .
`` What else could I do ? ?
Monsieur De Cury was incensed , of course .
But I said I would first have to get the author's permission .
And of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends .
Seeing him in that condition , and about to enter the hall where the King , the Queen , the whole royal family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present , Grimm and the Abbe Raynal and others tried to stop him .
Jean Jacques asked .
`` But here you are in the palace .
`` If they are here , then surely I have the right to be here '' , Rousseau said .
`` But in such a slovenly condition '' .
But of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold at all .
And even deeper than that : his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself .
Could he walk out in the midst of his piece ? ?
Before the King ? ?
It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began .
`` They're a-coming ! !
I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance .
The last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall , and this dashing rider made us feel a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation .
It was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; ;
In the very front rank , two men were wounded and staggered along , trailing blood behind them .
They marched with bayonets fixed , and as fixed on their faces was anger , fear , and torment .
One moment , the road was filled with disciplined troops , marching four by four with a purpose as implacable as death ; ;
and then I came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin Simmons by far .
Wherever you looked , you saw Committeemen running across the meadows , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; ;
and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty Militia were making their way in our direction .
`` It makes sense .
I went off with Cousin Simmons , who maintained that if he didn't see to me , he didn't know who would .
`` Good heavens , Adam '' , he said , `` I thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place '' .
Three men were around him .
Philibert Berthelier , the son of the famous patriot , disagreed .
John closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs .
The blue-draped Virgin was still there , but no one knelt before her now .
As he neared the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black cape whisked by .
John leaned upon the stone balustrade .
Sleep was difficult these days .
Severe headaches were frequent .
Geneva , instead of becoming the City of God , as John had dreamed , had in the two years since he had been there , continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished .
Dice rolled , prostitutes plied their trade , thieves stole , murderers stabbed , and the ungodly blasphemed .
Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by .
Eli Corault ! !
John stood above him , his face ashen .
What now ? ?
`` What will be the subject '' ? ?
He asked to be appointed a preacher .
`` What was your reply to that '' ? ?
The following morning , as John entered the Place Molard on his way to visit a sick refugee , he had a premonition of danger .
Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward .
One , more horrible than the rest , lunged , growling deep in his throat , his hair bristling .
Standing in the shelter of the tent -- a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no longer drumming -- Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beer barrels .
A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardines , or the bitters , or the condensed milk , or the stationery , or the needles -- what could it mean ? ?
Now the face was his own .
In that moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying : I must not hate him , I must not hate him or I shall die .
Now , Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choking the air .
He saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street , with an armful of wood .
Adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho .
With enormous interest , Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him .
The feet wore army shoes , in obvious disrepair .
The figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the drop clinging there .
Then the figure moved on .
They called her Mollie the Mutton , and laughed .
He could not make out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose .
Mollie the Mutton was scratching her nose .
The pattern would not stop .
It came again and again .
Far off , in the dusk , he heard voices singing , muffled but strong .
He thought of the old man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier .
He thought : Only in my heart can I make the world hang together .
`` Yeah '' , Mose murmured , `` yeah .
And look what he done give us '' .
She was a child too much a part of her environment , too eager to grow and learn and experience .
Laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away .
The infant , in white terry-cloth bathrobe , her face intense and purposeful , had essayed a few wobbly steps toward her father .
The comfort was short-lived , yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion .
She envied him .
Southern California gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell , drier , more enervating , more laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer past .
she was one of Eliot Sparling's neutralized minorities , adopting the rolling R's and constricted vowels of Los Angeles .
`` I'm awful sorry about what's happened '' , Selena said .
She charged off to the bedrooms .
He asked .
Kidnaper spurns ransom ; ;
The bulk of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt's conference .
However , the litter remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers .
Inside , as soon as Mr. Skopas had disclosed -- in a hoarse whisper -- the detective's errand , his family gathered in a huddle , forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of a baroque fireplace .
Studying them , McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple .
They possessed no outer fortifications , no hard shells of confidence ; ;
The door was answered by a slender man in his sixties -- straight-backed , somewhat clerical in manner , wearing rimless glasses .
`` Finally , all I needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life '' .
Stirring , he said : `` I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today '' .
Harold indicated the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in .
They passed the marmalade , the bread , the black-market butter , back and forth .
Eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown , and on his large feet he wore yellow Turkish slippers that turned up at the toes .
Professor Cestre , could it be ? ?
One of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas , which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet .
Though , taken individually , the big rooms were , or seemed to be , square , the apartment as a whole formed a triangle .
Locked .
He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said : `` Now what do we do '' ? ?
`` Call the Vouillemont , I guess '' .
They looked , even so .
Barbara bought some cotton aprons , and Harold bought shoestrings .
They had lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad , busy , unpicturesque streets , and coming home they got lost in the Metro ; ;
it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed , in order to take the line that went to the Place Redoute .
He was wearing sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt , and in his hand he carried a little black bag .
Barbara asked , as they heard the front door close .
They had Vermouth , sitting in front of a cafe .
He went down the hall to Eugene's bathroom , to turn on the hot-water heater , and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming trunks .
He looked around the room and then called out : `` Come here , quick '' ? ?
That boat in the river , maybe '' .
`` What boat '' ? ?
`` I know '' , he said , reading her mind .
`` I don't know what I'm going to do with you '' .
`` All because I didn't feel like dancing '' .
And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be .
They took Jesus's body , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; ;
Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses .
Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; ;
Since his Christ was to be life size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly ? ?
He started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper .
When the cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made .
He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation .
I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew .
I cannot accomplish this if you will not help me '' .
I'm sure he would approve '' .
And sensitivity '' .
Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber .
His first model arrived at dusk .
He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes .
But at the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother roughed in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends .
Though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry .
He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches .
Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; ;
10 .
The arrangement with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice .
water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal .
It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him .
Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi .
The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons .
They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot .
God would not do that , Kate thought stubbornly .
Joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom .
She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse's room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby's death .
Juanita drooped about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to `` Miss Juanita Fitzroy '' , bearing a Grafton postmark .
Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school .
What it was Kate could not fathom .
`` Hush '' , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , `` or I'll give you another black eye '' .
These would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately .
Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it ; ;
of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the B & O Railroad .
`` Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did ! !
I think I've taken it about fifty times already '' ! !
Winking at Joel's look of shock .
Maj. Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the U.S. Army .
In spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral , John Hunt Morgan is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen factory '' ! !
In the next few days they had cause to rejoice .
The week after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window .
She remembered McClellan's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs .
`` I stopped to say goodbye , Mrs. Lattimer , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby .
`` When are you to leave '' ? ?
`` Tomorrow .
Would you permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs. Lattimer '' ? ?
Kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations .
She sought Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling .
`` I could go with him .
But I am a slave ! !
It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky .
There were times now , like this , when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations .
Or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck .
A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace .
Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads .
He drove on , wary and shaken .
It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor .
Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; ;
He scratched his mosquito-plagued neck .
David finished shaving , washed his face clean of lather , and combed and retied his hair .
In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .
Warsaw is my city , not Tel Aviv '' .
He saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief , Roman , and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him .
Warsaw ! !
Warsaw ! !
He guessed by their appearance that they were Rumanians .
The Bathyrans were all gone .
The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian administrators .
Lublin was the seed of action for the `` final solution '' of the Jewish problem .
A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several million Jews A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of Madagascar Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names .
Lublin was their heart .
In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin .
Was there another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected ? ?
Not a bad girl .
I did exactly as instructed .
I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in exile in London '' .
`` Not everyone , Styka '' .
`` What good will it really do '' ? ?
Hell , sir .
`` But we are neither blind nor insane .
I've lost faith , Styka .
Andrei demanded .
Grabski looked at the pair of them .
His broad flat fingers , petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying , snatched the bills clumsily .
`` This ain't enough '' .
`` You get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek '' .
`` I ain't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business '' .
Andrei and Styka were silent .
`` Nothing's free in the whole goddam world '' , was all I could think of to say .
Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me .
I was crazy about her all over again .
`` You know I don't like my men to have other women .
I hate it '' .
The place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use .
Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic .
`` Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom .
`` Well I object .
I'm not a plaster saint .
Never in my life have I felt so remorseful about anything I've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife .
She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot .
I stiffened .
I wrote her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express .
You wouldn't have me throw the poor boy out on the street '' , Eileen said when I needled her about it .
I'd thought him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be .
Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet .
`` Connections '' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions .
Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything .
They weren't as well paid as they should have been .
There I was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement .
There was one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny .
It was only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions .
He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too .
His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days .
His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse .
Without exception Hino's brothers turned to either one or both of their father's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller .
The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission .
`` Oh '' ? ?
He was about to hang up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation open .
`` Arigato gosaimasu '' .
For the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter .
`` Why '' ? ?
`` I would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon '' , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission .
He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner .
Fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested .
He beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside .
`` No , only fourteen .
The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits , but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident .
`` I think I've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for a long time '' , he said .
Konishi can help you .
When everything had been done , Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock .
The fish took the bait .
He replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned .
She had never sung better .
`` Tomorrow will be a new experience -- I have never before made love to a nightingale .
The fire in the sitting room was lighted .
`` Tell me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you '' .
`` Although it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said Shelley as he closed the book , `` it is still poetry of a high order '' .
`` The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte '' , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness .
William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at once Shelley's pensioner and his most bitter detractor .
Alastor was published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored .
There are some even now .
What about that dear , clever Mr. Thynne ? ?
`` Poor Mr. Thynne , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement '' .
`` There are other Mr. Thynnes .
But the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing .
He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor , claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes .
Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel .
He would remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task .
-- Beckworth .
There's a lot of waste going on here .
It's got to stop .
-- Yes , sir .
Beckworth left the tent .
A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor .
The place smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine .
The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson's boots .
There was no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams .
An officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank .
The officer had told him that both lists must be checked .
The officer , surprised , said he would have to see .
He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him .
-- Yes , sir .
He tried to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy .
He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift .
He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion .
Hillman had written it all out , hadn't he ? ?
Wasn't the report official enough ? ?
The figure in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption .
Exactly ! !
The soldier's voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin .
They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats .
He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound .
Watson watched the creeping figure .
Would the man make it or not ? ?
If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud .
The figure halted , and Watson gasped .
They spun and flung their rifles up .
Watson gesticulated wildly .
Watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily .
The man wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson's neck .
He promised to take me .
-- hush .
We're almost there .
He stood with his back to the skiff .
He was angry , sickened .
No , nor later .
He was grimly satisfied .
I can see it from this window where I write .
It bulks under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and I think Mrs. Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning .
These trumps were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare .
Let's throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who's boss '' .
One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it .
It was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis .
It was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks .
Mrs. Ten Eyke did mental health .
Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer .
Mrs. Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her .
`` I got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund '' , she said excitedly when he walked in .
I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning -- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner '' ? ?
`` But I don't know the Flannagans '' , Charlie Pastern said .
He was tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day .
The name encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish .
Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight .
`` I've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible .
The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness .
`` I've never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey .
`` She told me he was in Germany '' .
He thought first of his son and daughter , away at college .
It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known .
She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray .
`` Please come down as soon as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen , `` I have an important matter to discuss with you '' .
There's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family .
What hope lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name ? ?
But the boy the boy had been alive yesterday .
He ran on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire .
What bad grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown .
I feel kind of bad about it '' .
The air took on a special strength now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind .
`` Remember the Starbird ? ?
Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them .
Oh he'd not care about the Pedersen kid .
I was leaning too far over .
`` Get the hell out of here '' .
He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear .
He was bitter when he missed .
He's got him in the kitchen '' .
`` No , Pa .
`` You don't understand , Pa .
Pa had his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he'd grown a mustache once .
That cock .
And don't come back .
They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt .
Then he threw things .
Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister .
I heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs .
`` What about your pa '' ? ?
Did you ask him about the whisky '' ? ?
`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans '' .
Well , get your pa and get that whisky '' .
He don't care about anybody .
Now Hans had given Ma something of his -- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa -- something valuable ; ;
Ma had found one of Pa's hiding places .
She'd found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found , saying nothing .
But he didn't figure Ma for much .
You ought to know that '' .
Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin .
I took him by the shoulders .
He'll choke '' .
Put your arms around him '' .
I put my arm carefully around him .
Hans had his fingers in the kid's mouth .
Just hold him like I told you '' .
He was in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing .
His files , desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos .
It all seemed -- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows -- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's work .
He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him .
Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .
He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once .
Once more and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked .
She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life .
but they might as well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on .
When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs , she would go to the Big House .
The women , keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room , sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night .
The children had to play away from the house ( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper quietness .
`` About the same , John , about the same '' .
`` We were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming , `` and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home .
There was the suggestion of ice water , and -- in spite of the protest `` We're not really thirsty '' -- Linda Kay , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices , hurried to the kitchen .
`` And who is this '' ? ?
He asked , when she passed him a glass .
This joke was not funny to Linda Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; ;
`` He makes me uncomfortable '' .
Bobby Joe was thinking about something else .
There never was a season before , but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth '' .
Linda Kay asked .
`` Howard '' .
`` Hell , I don't know .
When he was a kid I wasn't around '' .
`` You lucky kids '' , he said .
Then he told Linda Kay about himself .
`` Oh , you could .
Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting , and Uncle Bill Farnworth ( from Mama Albright's side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then .
Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; ;
but she had never been so aware of anyone's flesh before .
Still she was not sorry he sat by her , but in fact was flattered .
He had become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell .
Alex asked .
Inside , carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; ;
He placed it on Alex's lap .
That first entry there is the Vermont Flumenophobe , the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties -- great big scapulars and hardly any primaries at all .
Couldn't take them near a river , though , or they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before Thanksgiving '' .
The ledger was full of most precise information : date of laying , length of incubation period , number of chick reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster's wattles and so on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen .
The purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set up , nestling in the doctor's arms .
Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled .
Alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him , attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind Alex's arm and back .
With that he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze .
Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again .
`` Have you got our keys handy '' ? ?
`` All right .
the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door .
A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside ; ;
The doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied .
But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure .
Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool .
She looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper .
Sighing , Leona dropped the paper and stood up .
`` Here '' .
`` What room is there going to be in an apartment for any child '' ? ?
I mean our children '' .
`` Four years '' ! !
`` How many times have I told you '' -- he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off -- `` Too many times '' ! !
Too many times was the truth of it , Winston thought .
`` How you going to work with a child hanging on you '' ? ?
He sat for a while with his hands on his knees , watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things -- a comb , a bottle of aspirin -- to take upstairs and pack .
it was something to do with her back , the thinness of it , and the quick , jerky way she bent .
Winston hurried through the swinging door .
`` I've been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr. Jack complained .
He was standing in front of the mirror , tightening his tie .
`` I don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes '' , he said .
`` This coat looks like a rag heap '' .
Winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work .
`` Hey '' ! !
Winston had been surprised at her for that .
Still , he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress -- citron yellow , if he remembered .
`` Winston '' , she said , `` get the basket for the breakables '' .
Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall .
Frowning , Miss Ada studied the list .
Neither of them trusted the movers .
`` Picture ! !
You mean picture of me '' ? ?
Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown .
After a minute he went on , `` People must think the curse is on me , seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray '' .
All I want is a picture -- with a few lines .
In final separation from them , in the railroad terminal across the river from New York , I would nearly cry .
Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after-school class I was enrolled .
They caused my love for Jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again .
It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it .
All this was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year ! !
When in one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New Year's Eve , I knew for a moment an immense relief ; ;
Her optimism gave me heart .
Times Square , when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming with celebrants , with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey .
Cardboard noisemakers , substitutes for the unavailable tin models , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway , and one's ears were continually serenaded by the horns' rasps and bleats .
How did one join them ? ?
Where were they all walking to ? ?
It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking .
I grew uneasy .
All about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking place , like abrupt , jerky scenes in old silent movies , joyous greetings and beginnings , huggings and kissings , enthusiastic forays into the festive night .
Whole platoons were taking up new positions on the steps , arriving and departing , while I stayed glued , like a signpost , to one spot .
An interne , a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us .
I had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall Field & Co. .
This had worried her .
`` Why do you say that '' ? ?
I don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you .
You don't believe that I'm going back to medical school and finish , do you '' ? ?
It's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover .
I'm the oldest of six children .
They even pay me six dollars a month .
I asked .
I have no one but myself to worry about '' .
`` Tell me more about them '' .
Her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother , aunts and uncles , cousins .
When she had finished I said :
I'll bet he wouldn't be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date -- I mean , after I'm out of the hospital , a month or so from now '' .
`` My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years .
He's a pretty good judge of character , Anderson .
I don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a rumdum in the future '' .
`` What about you ? ?
`` Yes , I'll get one overnight a month '' .
There hadn't been anything really personal in her interest in me .
It was a fantastic story .
The critics literally screamed their indignation .
Then later I had quit my safe , secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play .
`` All right .
I followed him out through the lobby to the street .
The Oldsmobile with the license number JYJ 114 was in stall number five .
`` That's right '' , I told him .
`` Sure '' , I told him .
I put in new batteries so as to be certain I'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully .
One of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street , trying to make himself inconspicuous , keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting .
one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb parking '' .
`` I'm in a rush right now .
I know where the car is .
After a while the signal became a buzz and I knew he was behind me .
I found a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited .
I sat where I could watch the exit and realized I was hungry .
I sat there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee .
My man came out an hour later , drove to the beach , turned right and after half a mile went to the Swim and Tan Motel .
It was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front .
I waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to register .
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't check the license number on the plates against the license number the tenant writes out .
If he does , it's still better than an even chance he won't notice the transposition of the numbers , and if he should notice it , the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake .
I took another sidelong glance at the other registration card , then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car .
I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed .
It's one thing to go without food when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply postponing a meal , but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's bedded down for the night , hunger can be a gnawing torture .
I had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile .
`` Oh , you ! !
'' She announced .
`` Good figures should be kept in hand '' , she said , and walked away with an exaggerated wiggle .
I turned on the device again , half fearful that I might find silence , but the buzzes came in loud and clear .
When I switched on the lights for her to come and get the check , I had the exact change plus a dollar tip .
Roberta glanced up at her husband .
It was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top .
The two men watched as Dave closed the door behind them , watched them cross the sidewalk to their car .
The fat man removed his apron , put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket , and zipped it over his paunch .
Got it '' ? ?
A line of worry formed , a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side .
He said , `` Grosse ? ?
`` -- had enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the parents -- I coulda let her go go '' -- His eyes were lowered , so he couldn't have seen the narrow , pointed face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury ; ;
He spoke soothingly .
`` What am I going to do with her all day ? ?
Just get her where Guardino won't see her and start asking questions '' .
Grosse swore now .
`` I got one question '' .
Impatiently .
`` In a Chicago slum just like you .
It was one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you .
So , he understood her panic .
She felt a lift in spirit .
When she was finished she pushed it back .
Lauren said , `` Please '' ? ?
the unknown was so much worse than -- what dangers lay ahead for her ? ?
Dave said , `` I got the message .
We're going '' .
You go .
I can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner '' .
His eyes were threaded by little filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into them .
Marty recognized the man .
Marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him , looked into their staring eyes .
Perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him .
There was a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers .
Now the dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch , too broad to leap over unless you were an Olympic star .
He was trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car .
That had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road .
When the two cars were equidistant from him , the station wagon started up again and the Ford gathered speed .
For moments he stood in water , shivering and gasping for breath .
He had turned his ankle slightly , and it pained him .
And then the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again .
He would be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time , all the way to Jarrodsville .
He still had three miles to go .
He could not go through the fields .
He had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the rail fence , the section by the farmhouse .
He climbed back to the road , and he felt utterly exhausted .
He lost all sense of dignity .
He had to reach Admassy's place .
And then he heard them .
He did not try to run .
It was the prowl car from the sheriff's office .
There was someone in front with the sheriff .
When it was finally pointed east , he said , `` You should never have come out here alone .
He listened a moment and then said , `` Hold it '' .
`` I hope to Christ .
We've got one other call to make before I meet Alvarez '' .
That is , maybe not too much of a lady .
At least , I want to find out whether she's home yet or not '' .
Shayne said , `` I know it was , Tim '' .
I got a quick look at their faces as we went past .
`` Wait a minute , Mike .
In Painter's office this evening .
`` What are they doing here '' ? ?
They've got no official standing on this side of the Bay .
`` How often do they add up to headlines ? ?
`` Make a couple of punk detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God they'd stayed out of my way this afternoon .
Shayne strode out blithely , and Rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink , getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police .
He walked over to the right-hand door , opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket .
He hoped he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives , but its weight was comforting at his hip .
They were both breathing heavily , out cold , and Shayne didn't think either of them had recognized him or could describe him .
He glanced up in time to see Roberts hurtling down on him from above , literally flying through the air , his bloody face twisted .
Mickey tried to flatten against the banister , gripped it with one hand , but Roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the groin .
When his vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling upward , reaching .
Mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet , which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack .
Mickey backed off again and Roberts hesitated , then came along .
This was going to be it now , any second , and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor , no matter what , even if Roberts should feint with a kick to the groin , the deadly hand was his exclusive concern .
It moved in a silver arc toward his throat , then veered downward .
He hunched his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' forearm with his own , felt the blade slide off his sleeve .
The sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate , sudden-end sound .
After a minute he went to Roberts , looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse .
Roberts appeared to be dead ; ;
He found the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes .
It snowed continuously , but quietly , evenly .
It would be a bad place to die .
There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter .
It wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact .
He climbed down , went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit .
Liz Peabody , he thought , might spend some time grieving for her lost lover , but he doubted that she would launch an investigation .
A woman named Lisa who tells nobody anything about herself .
That courtyard picture with the same initials '' .
`` I'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm .
He checked into a motel and drove downtown .
A clerk in the outer office took him in to Sheriff Carruthers , a big , paunchy man with thick , white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office .
The sheriff's swivel chair tilted back .
Pity we don't know more about him .
It'll be a tedious job , but if you want to try it , the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county supervisor's office '' .
He smiled .
She'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment .
If you find out anything , come on back here and we'll get started on it '' .
She was a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter .
`` Never mind .
`` Have they inherited some money or something '' ? ?
She asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye .
He hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving .
It was , indeed , all here -- almost a century .
The one line on the bride said she was Miss Lisa Carmody from Baton Rouge .
No mention of New Orleans .
The item said Mr. and Mrs. Black had moved to Jackson , his home town -- so the lovely Lisa had been with him a year ago .
He glanced at his watch , saw it was only seven , and decided to indulge his weakness now .
Then he knew it was not sound , but lack of it .
The air conditioner was no longer running .
It clanged shut as he sprang toward it .
He pressed his face against the grille .
`` Hey , come back '' , he shouted .
Then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind .
But why ? ?
Nobody could hear what was going on in this underground vault .
Until now , Lilac Gaylor and Lila Kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing .
Except for those minutes in her room , he had lost touch with her as a reality .
Someone reasonably trustworthy .
And Angie would hear about it .
And Angie knew --
I don't want no trouble , you don't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr. Skyros '' .
Dear heaven , no , thought Mr. Skyros , turning away as another man came in .
Anything to do with an ace o' spades , bad luck '' .
Ace of spades -- a widow , that was what they called a widow , these low-class crooks remembered Mr. Skyros distractedly .
When things got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand -- it seemed to be a general rule .
Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo's regular-featured , almost girlishly good-looking face -- or indeed anything about Angelo .
I stay in business so long because I'm careful .
I can't wait no two weeks '' .
Angelo gave him an affectionate smile .
`` Mr. Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me '' , he said .
You don't need worry , Angelo .
Sure .
A couple decks for me , Mr. Skyros -- and ten-twelve to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash '' .
`` And you know , Angelo , Pretty , he always keeps it a strict cash basis , like they say '' --
`` I do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend .
And , Here , I'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I don't bother with it , see ! !
This kind of place
She'd be through here , just no time at all -- leave this kind of thing 'way behind .
She had it all planned out , how she'd do .
She didn't mind working hard , not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft -- all she wanted was a chance , where she wasn't marked as what she was .
To be Katharine Ross , and work in a nicer shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes , and learn ladies' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up to now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign-sounding names , the ones went to the same church and -- Different place , different job , different people , she'd be all different too .
`` A lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats , it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens -- and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away ! !
I wonder if the Carters would take one .
Oh , well , you can't really blame Lolotte .
She opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you .
Maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start .
`` I forgot .
She had lost a bottle of opium -- but that was on the trip from New Orleans .
Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall .
No .
But -- well , she'd be very careful .
So somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died .
Rev loved Honotassa , it was like a part of his breath and body ; ;
There was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd been .
In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens .
And the fields were green and growing .
Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah's room .
She couldn't see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her .
Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her .
They were all three bent over a shabby riding boot ; ;
`` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly .
Rev looked up and saw her .
He turned to George and Lolotte .
George poised with the tack hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder .
Her words jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in Rev's face .
Glendora gave a gulp .
I didn't think there was any reason to '' .
Try talking to some of the fellows he works with , friends , anyone .
`` Black is Gilborn's best friend '' .
`` I know '' .
`` Will you be coming back soon '' ? ?
`` I don't think anything .
`` Aren't you ever going to go home '' ? ?
Conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench , massaging his right leg .
He wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from Lionel Black .
It was a cold , windy day , the day after Kitti's death , but Stanley Gilborn paid no attention to the blustery October wind .
Mainly of what Conrad had tried to make him believe .
It was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence , in no logical succession .
They made sense and yet they didn't .
It wasn't so because it couldn't be so .
Kitti had come along to justify everything .
The doorman began to nod his head automatically , then remembered who Gilborn was , what had happened to him the night before .
He looked at Gilborn with undisguised curiosity .
There was no evidence that anything was different than it had been .
Without taking off his coat , he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door .
He felt no anger towards Kitti , no sense that she had betrayed him .
Someone had taken her away from him .
Who ? ?
Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with Who ? ?
The figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter .
The dentist last night , for instance .
It was nothing that he said or did , but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him , looking forward to his eventual proposal .
Stanley went along in life , she knew , convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman .
But one day , she expected , he would somehow discover , without her having to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; ;
Kitti could have married a score of men .
Kitti had come into the office , on somebody's recommendation , because she needed help in preparing her income tax return .
After that day , Blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened .
She didn't tell anyone , even her mother , what was wrong .
Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered woman's apartment , we might have had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness .
Just put yourself in Felix's place for a moment .
You still have your paper hat and you're wearing it , but then , it is an extraordinary paper hat and , in addition to anything else you may be , you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back yard .
It's not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr. Average Citizen .
Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness .
Instead of answering you , he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs .
Felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house .
I don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures .
For Felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement .
He was dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's country weekend .
`` The world is full of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene .
`` You live in the present '' ? ?
`` In the present '' , Felix proclaimed .
The happy one could never have looked happier .
I love fingerprints '' .
Gibby called him back .
Nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world '' .
Having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty , he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible .
It was that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house , where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope .
These shapes might have been mad , but there was no telling .
They were all completely shrouded .
Everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman's comfort , convenience and efficiency .
It was still a very big world , despite all the modern cant to the contrary .
He was dozing , perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten .
He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance .
Hub considered .
they had nothing to give to each other .
He had little time to himself , anyway .
Thornburg arrived with the writers .
He asked if there was anything he could do .
`` It's worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy .
Backstage was tomblike by contrast .
Andy's co-workers kept their distance , awed by the tragedy .
It was signed by everyone in the troupe .
Andy couldn't help but be touched .
Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently .
Andy told him , `` Bake , I wish you'd talk to Skolman , see if some kind of p. a. system can be rigged up outside .
Andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying .
My men have been here all afternoon , setting up for this thing '' .
Motion picture cameras had been installed to film the audience , the reservation list was being checked out name by name , and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead .
However , it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside , even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose .
Didn't they tell you what I wanted the p. a. system for '' ? ?
`` No longer than yours .
Or have a sign on his car that says , ' Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper ' '' ? ?
I can hardly wait '' .
Andy's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock .
Bake asked .
`` They're drinking , aren't they '' ? ?
If Rock shows up during the number -- or you hear anything -- give me the signal '' .
He may try to phone us '' .
The act , cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon , had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone .
Here's where luck would normally step in .
the evening was still not beyond salvaging , not as a show but for him as a person .
Ray , if you please -- the ' Cradle Song ' '' .
He sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience .
Nor could he blame them .
''
The money's here , all of it '' .
At this moment , all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo .
`` Did you hear them ? ?
You'll never believe the places I've been today .
We've done our part '' .
The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent ; ;
Just don't tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours '' .
Rossi and Ferguson have been across the street , talking to the kid .
He limps , and the man who hit you and took the cane , he limped .
`` You sound like an old woman .
She smoothed the skirt , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows .
With sudden energy , she went to the phone and rang Holden's office and asked for him .
You can't wander along in the dark , can you ? ?
For a moment he thought of going into Crosson's office to explain that he had to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a pounding in his head , that he decided to let it go .
Let her call Crosson if she wanted to , let Crosson raise the roof or even can him , he didn't care .
Once out in the street , the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken .
It hadn't amounted to anything .
There had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions .
Too monstrous , of course .
She wouldn't be wilfully planning his destruction .
He had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide .
Cooper was beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there morosely ; ;
Why , Holden said to himself , surprised at his own sudden insight , I'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be .
Hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension .
Glad to see you go .
He drove into the paved space before the garage and got out , slamming the car door .
You used them that time you painted the porch at our other house .
Wait a minute .
What do you '' --
`` Green paint , wasn't it ? ?
She took another bite of toast .
Tell them the truth or something before they come here '' .
his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like , liable to break like an icicle at any moment .
A man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said , `` Is this more like it , Mrs. MacReady ? ?
More like this , maybe '' ? ?
he had been at the Dumont for almost a week .
( `` I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been .
The King Arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want -- heaven knew didn't want ! !
-- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and , at odd hours of night , drive from smaller stations to distant homes , probably through rain or , in November , something worse .
( Anyone active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be .
Like , for example , a man carrying a twenty-two rifle , probably with a telescopic sight attached ? ?
There was , of course , no hope it really would be that simple .
The sniper , whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent , would hardly have walked to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder , whistling a marching tune .
Long thin suitcase ? ?
Who measures ? ?
Anything else ? ?
Anything at all ? ?
Weigand tossed this news into the centrifuge .
He would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey .
Willings was , presumably , a better than average shot .
Grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind .
( Call it mentally young ; ;
With the boy , particularly .
`` Right '' ? ?
A man named Blaine Smythe , with `` y '' and `` e '' but pronounced without them , had been fired at Payne's insistence .
Stilts and Shadow , on Pam's bed , appeared to be one cat -- rather large , as Siamese cats go , and , to be sure , having two heads and two tails .
Martha presumably would cope .
After a time , it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble .
That was more like a thought , but not a great deal more .
The poor kid -- the poor , frail kid .
Some people have luck and some have no luck and that , whatever people who prefer order say , is the size of it .
Two martinis for lunch -- that was the trouble .
`` That damn door '' , said the police chief .
Much better to break a cellar window '' .
`` Yeah .
Scrapings from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities .
No other cause of death apparent .
`` That's about it .
No one the Medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about Johnston .
He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers .
Promptly at one-thirty he entered Hohlbein and Garth's elegant suite of offices in Medfield's newest professional building .
She had reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker's death .
Garth hesitated .
`` Mr. Hohlbein and I have noticed some lapses since , though .
Most of them this past year , I'd say .
Madden settled back to read the will .
Very nice for him .
Too bad , Madden thought .
But he didn't play golf , didn't seem to belong to any local clubs -- his work took him away a lot , of course -- which probably accounted for his tendency to keep to himself .
Even so , Madden's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepened .
The inspector knew as he left that this was wishful thinking .
Airy and bright , the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture , rugs , and draperies .
For all her domineering ways , I can't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy '' .
I want the captain in charge .
`` Leigh , get a grip on yourself .
`` Not about me ? ?
Will you call that captain '' ? ?
`` It doesn't matter .
You get back to the captain and tell him this : Somebody's going to take a shot at the prime minister , and Mahzeer is in on the plot .
He turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back .
He finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing .
He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him .
`` Well '' ? ?
it would be just like him .
He asked .
He would have to do something on his own .
the scene looked like a Christmas card .
How was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance ? ?
Would the shot come from a roof ? ?
Hoag crossed the narrow street , squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk .
the room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain .
two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted .
He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule .
He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town house , and its owners were in residence ; ;
The occupants of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few days , and not likely to return on a Friday .
fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open .
He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop .
The safe at Ingleside District Station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to Captain Harris's office ( to the left ) , the lieutenant's office ( farther along and to the left ) and the janitor's supply closet ( straight ahead ) .
Gun went to the connecting door , which was open , and stood at attention while Orville Torrence Killpath , in full uniform , finished combing his hair .
Finally , Orville intoned through his hawk nose , `` We can't have people running in any time they please , Sergeant '' .
Killpath said , `` You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago , Sergeant .
That's not getting all the juice out of the orange , now is it '' ? ?
He smiled thinly , savoring his joke .
`` What if I said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen '' ? ?
`` He let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper .
A car pulled into the driveway outside the window .
But for some fool reason he couldn't remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail .
He stared at the report in Killpath's hand , sure it was written by Accacia -- just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand .
What have you to say to that , Sergeant '' ? ?
`` Morning , Lieutenant Rinker '' .
`` The sergeant is just leaving '' .
Then
A time plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' -- He interrupted himself , smiling .
`` I put her in lamps .
`` She says she has to finish a story '' .
He was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools and a proper university .
Since then he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling .
She glanced at her companion fondly .
None of this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand .
He put the basket down distastefully , muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof .
The important thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket .
`` Casey '' ? ?
When he heard Calenda say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? ?
Even so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly .
`` But I meant what I said , Casey .
He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up .
He kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink .
Only then did he decide he didn't want one .
`` Casey ? ?
You don't know me but I know you .
Slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl , and watched Elaine rapidly spin from one station to another , tune in the null , then draw in a line on the chart .
Poet came in , raising his eyebrows appreciatively as he saw Elaine .
`` Will you drop the anchor '' ? ?
No one had prayed .
She threw back a cushion over one of the seats , unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it , then presently straightened , holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand .
Elaine nodded .
A moment later , moving awkwardly because of the swimming fins , she picked up the gun , handed the knife to Poet , then rolled off the transom of the boat , back first .
Another moment and they were out of sight , leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts .
It was an odd combination a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the Trinidad .
That was a hell of a note , he thought .
A couple couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them .
If the character flying that thing had gone over San Clemente Island yesterday he would have had an eyeful .
Behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small ground-swell , a lone fisherman in the chair aft .
Nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in Southern California were over the La Jolla Deep and the Redondo Deep , two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline .
The fin on his foot caught on the moulding , throwing him off balance .
Turning slowly he saw Poet in a brilliant glare of horror .
Poet ! !
Her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin , her body absolutely motionless .
So did Poet .
Poet was the captured , arms pinioned to his side , and he twisted convulsively trying to escape .
A black , snake-like object swayed eerily in front of him , spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head .
At the same instant , he grabbed the loose , writhing hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece .
Harbor Point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam .
It's a rich village but not much for action -- too many solid residents , not enough tourists or working stiffs .
Chief Bob Moore looked his same hick-self ; ;
You sure climbed fast , Jed .
Took me 19 years to become Chief of our three man police force .
Came to the Harbor as a bride and Don't worry Jed , this one is in the bag .
Never had no trouble with him before , thought he was a hard worker , hustling around to get a full week's work .
No doubt about Tim being the killer -- I have a witness .
`` I'll collar Tim before night '' .
Probably the last of the original Island Indians .
Another fact : Tim's disappeared -- on the run .
Guess you want to see the body -- have her up the street in Doc Abel's office '' .
`` Find any prints '' ? ?
I dropped the sheet , glanced at my watch .
It was almost one and I hadn't had lunch .
Still , I wanted to get this over with , had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office .
I told him , `` I want to go see the Buck house '' .
`` Yeah , it's a real load '' , I told him , looking up the street at my battered Ford .
Years ago when I asked her to put me in Social Security , so's I wouldn't have to be working now , Miss Julia threatened to fire me -- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her '' .
`` Her '' ? ?
I walked into the living room .
`` I'll take you there .
She hadn't seen him since .
He'll get a fair trial .
Chief Moore said , `` If I don't see you when I return , see you for certain at my road block , Inspector '' .
I had a bowl of decent chowder , phoned the Doc and he said he'd leave the death statements with his girl -- in a half hour .
Even now , there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock , an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater .
To the hotel people , you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite '' .
`` That's your headache .
`` The police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a fine-tooth comb .
Ten to one , it's even been redecorated '' ! !
`` I'm betting on that chance .
Interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk .
Try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself -- between eleven p.m. and one a.m. the night you arrive '' .
A sudden thought wiped the smirk from his face .
After all , the murderer is still at large .
At the time of her divorce Forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in lieu of further alimony if she remarried .
So was the gun .
Find a motive for Stacy or an opportunity for Forbes and the case would be solved .
`` That suite is taken '' .
There was a sudden stillness in the lobby .
Two women , who had been chattering like parrots , were struck dumb .
The clerk's eyes flickered .
`` I don't believe it '' .
Show this gentleman to 1105 '' ! !
The room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window .
`` N-no '' .
The boy raised his eyes .
`` Listen , mister .
Then , `` I'm not talking .
He was in a hurry to get out of the room .
There was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on the wall .
When the neon sign flashed on , the shadow was still there .
That meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light -- in this case , the window .
Something hard grazed his knuckles .
He put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be .
The blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room .
On the bare floorboards a man lay face down .
There was a slight bulge under the left armpit -- a shoulder holster .
But he was surprised to meet it here .
He opened his eyes .
`` What are you doing here '' ? ?
The man opened his mouth , but no words came .
The man opened his mouth wider .
Alec leaned forward to look .
And she answered , `` I don't know , but I hope you'll never do such a thing '' .
Without a tremor , `` God forbid '' ! !
He said , and went out and cut his throat in the cave near Granny Day's swamp .
His ghost is not laid .
When you hold the spirit of a thing , then somehow you know the truth -- you know a fake antique from the real thing .
Just think of old Granther Stannard who pulled the teeth of Dark Younger ( her real name was Dorcas ) , and because he bungled the job and left two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs were made of glass .
but now it's the most lost and tortured place in the world .
Those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity took on some of the moraine's stony character .
We'll walk up there later .
Handley lived further on , at Pigeon Cove .
What should one say ? ?
I knew Red and Handley well .
They'd come , separately , to Gloucester some twenty years ago -- there's always been an artists' colony somewhere on Cape Ann -- and each married here .
Pretty girls among them , with blonde hair and pert faces .
And it was because of an old Norberg inheritance that I got to understand them all so well .
No , I don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things .
About five years ago , Handley came to ask me if he could see the tattered register .
( When you see him , you'll notice his habit of fingering , I might almost say , stroking a large mole with black hairs on it , by his right temple .
Like his glossy black hair .
A real gentleman , I feel , would do neither .
The next week , cousin Red wandered in as casually , but curt and untidy .
When I told him someone had torn it out , he shouted .
During the quarrel I learned what the trouble was , from the accusations each hurled at the other .
Fortunately , I knew almost exactly what the will had said .
After the usual Honorable Sirs , it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased Salu Norberg , one lower room , on the Western side , privileges to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar ( I can show you the cellar when we go up ) , also one Cow Right , and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower , namely the Beech Pasture .
Yet with all this knowledge I had nothing of substance to unravel our case , as you would call it , till yesterday .
Anyhow , I wasn't surprised , early that morning , to see Handley himself crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back Road .
Why hadn't he noticed it before ? ?
No , the man was not drunk
When the light went their way , they went on across the street .
`` Guess I can't think of anyone , Pete .
A faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows .
Go ahead and try me '' ! !
`` Fine .
Give me your address .
Inside the lobby , people were standing around , talking excitedly .
His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened .
He had apparently been alone .
Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor , as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks .
But after all , why should they ? ?
It was the same bar , and it was two weeks later -- Saturday night , when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual .
He began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing .
`` No offense intended '' , he said gently .
The cops didn't suspect a thing , and I thought it was a coincidence .
He shrugged casually .
`` floor level's about three feet down , so don't fall '' .
`` Listen , I got a buddy I travel with , real nice guy named Larry .
Could he join the party and sleep here tonight too ? ?
He hesitated a second , looking at the bottle , before he said `` Sure-sure '' , and I reassured him .
His `` sure-sure '' was enthusiastic this time .
This was the same , except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves .
We'd heard the record together once .
Pops was taking long ones , but not showing the effect yet .
and he'd never known what hit him -- he'd never known that anything had hit him .
-- and said it sharply , not as in the Patchen bit , but as an order -- so I stopped my hand and looked at him .
I dug him , I saw his point ; ;
I nodded to Charlie .
It was a kick , but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again , except for stakes .
Now , first question : the bottles .
Here's the picture we want to leave for the fuzz -- whenever the body gets found .
Besides , I doubt if the cops will even try dusting .
We took the matches -- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might retain fingerprints -- and the change .
The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out .
We decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow .
But we were really going to do it .
I drew diagrams and floor plans ; ;
it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie said , `` Well , I guess that's it .
Or would you rather deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin rummy , or what '' ? ?
And if you're as flat broke as I am , I think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work '' .
I've got a little stashed for a rainy day , and I guess this is rainy enough .
If you draw the short straw I'll lend you some bread , like fifty bucks , before I take off to visit my sister in Frisco .
I took a deep breath , and the plunge .
Mike remained in trance ; ;
Before midnight he speeded his heart , resumed normal breathing , ran down his check list , uncurled and sat up .
`` Oh '' .
`` A fine idea '' , Mike agreed .
his foster parents had taught him to see .
As for the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on Mount Everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure ; ;
he was considerate of their weakness , once he learned of it .
But he was looking forward to snow -- seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read -- walking barefoot , rolling in it .
`` Fine '' .
it was a goodness , beauty .
`` Mike , there's Mars .
But my people -- Martians , I mean ; ;
Mike had not heard it ; ;
Mr. Booker T. W. Jones Food Technician First Class is not sad ; ;
He had his own face , dark and beautiful .
`` Oh , dear ! !
Oh ! !
`` We grok God '' .
The Old Ones neither helped nor hindered this plan ; ;
Eternity is no time for recriminations .
Some of them were warts until they got promoted .
The Martians have their own setup , different from ours , and as long as they need him , we can't touch him .
Otherwise , straighten your halo , square your wings , and dig in .
Get Happy , junior '' ! !
His household had gone through an upset .
Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches .
Jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone to pieces .
Macneff smiled and said , `` I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression '' .
He was a good impresser , that Pornsen .
If I die , I die because I willed it so .
If you volunteer , you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves .
`` No problem at all '' , said Macneff .
Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said , `` You are horrified , of course .
Six months later , Hal Yarrow stood in the observation dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him .
Neither nation would give up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War .
Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen City would blaze out into space .
But Mary would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti .
No matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt
`` My beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , said the whining voice .
The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words .
The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses .
All the other parts of speech : nouns , pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs .
No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer .
)
At last Gabriel spoke .
`` We misjudged you '' , he said slowly .
You may reclaim your property , and the penalty on Hesperus is lifted .
And the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine .
This explained a great deal .
but the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban , and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on this limited question .
Suppose that this one were to work ? ?
They are on their way here '' .
Then the skiff hove into sight , just a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks of the Coal Sack .
And there would be no chance of signaling them -- without the Nernst generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone .
Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him .
But where was it going ? ?
It was equally clear that as of this moment , the treaty was off .
Therefore of course I will help '' .
Without an instant's transition , the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board .
`` Well , let's take a ground-level look at the country around here '' .
The facsiport rolled open on the landscape .
A range of bluffs hugged the horizon , the color of decaying moss .
Ryan asked .
Think they're intelligent , maybe hostile '' ? ?
`` I get no readings from them at all .
`` I'm not worried about you mis-reading the dials , Nogol , just about a lug like you reading them at all .
Positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark '' .
Still , it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world .
Ekstrohm cleared his throat .
`` What shall we do with this one ? ?
Ryan nudged it with his toe , following Ekstrohm's example .
`` It looks like we did , when we made blastdown '' .
Any little dose of radiation might knock off these critters '' .
Insects there were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun .
Ekstrohm stood up .
But what was there to do ? ?
He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep .
Ekstrohm never slept .
Insomnia would ground him from the Exploration Service , on physiological if not psychological grounds .
Since he couldn't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports .
A man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him .
He scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer , but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the weighty , pontifical , ponderous style .
The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him .
`` Okay , Stormy , this isn't the place for fun and games .
What did you do with them '' ? ?
`` Do with what '' ? ?
All the dead animals laying around the ship '' .
There was no ring of animal corpses .
Nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze .
`` You are right now , buddy .
What would I want with them '' ? ?
The tapes show that .
`` Don't try anything violent , Stormy .
Why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong ? ?
She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery .
instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions .
For Helva was destined to be the `` brain '' half of a scout ship , partnered with a man or a woman , whichever she chose , as the mobile half .
Her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high .
They would have to bide their official time and see , trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her , too , as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession .
Shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were , but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the Universe .
Her subject was large -- a copy of the Last Supper -- and her canvas , small -- the head of a tiny screw .
Helva's hum then had a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings .
`` Vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated .
`` Thank you .
Asked the lady .
`` I am currently reproducing the Last Supper on the head of a screw '' .
`` Of course , some of my color values do not match the old Master's and the perspective is faulty but I believe it to be a fair copy '' .
`` If you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in question '' .
The good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time .
She would work out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing .
Her extendibles were diverted , connected or augmented and the final , delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while Helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings .
Her first actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight , showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession .
The many-bodied girl lay near him .
A painful stab hit him in the abdomen .
People never live forever .
He was wide awake , but he did not feel like doing anything .
The agonies of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing .
After a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms .
At last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain .
Did you ever see a play '' ? ?
`` But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going to come back with the needle '' .
I mean we know the order in which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes .
Mercer himself could not tell how long it was before B'dikkat came back .
Once again B'dikkat moved among them like a father ; ;
once again they clustered like children .
She had lost the extra torsos .
but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` People never live forever '' .
Fighting pleasure itself , he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there .
What kept him happy without super-condamine ? ?
He remembered the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan .
Far long ago , some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter .
Nor did they care .
Now I can only write , and that only when I get out of pain .
He certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle as Ann .
Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann , and then could not get back to sleep .
No one walked in this country , least of all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar B crew .
His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , angling toward the house .
Reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands .
The boy licked his dry lips .
Morgan jerked his head toward the front door .
`` Get up .
No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him .
Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth .
He stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition .
The girl dropped off to sleep .
He asked .
We ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days '' .
`` Are we in Wyoming '' ? ?
`` Then we're lucky we got here .
Dan Morgan '' .
He dismissed the possibility at once .
He wasn't so sure about the boy .
`` I could use some help '' , Morgan said finally , `` but I can't afford to pay you anything .
`` I'll see '' , Morgan said .
She rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair .
`` Who are you ? ?
`` Oh '' .
Do you take in all the strays who come by '' ? ?
`` Mr. Morgan , it's the best-looking food I ever saw '' .
He said : `` You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath .
Your feet are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones .
The bed isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there '' .
`` We'll pay you back if you'll let us .
`` It's all right '' , he said .
They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed .
Gavin paused wearily .
Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock .
Against that other man he could rally his anger ; ;
`` Do you remember Big Charlie '' ? ?
He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder .
Oh ! !
Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .
You get ready ''
`` She doesn't want you now .
Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps .
`` Clay '' , he said , `` where are we goin '' ? ?
I have to think about it .
Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child .
There was no one but me .
Thirty-five
Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .
He saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying .
They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills .
He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .
That's what you wanted , isn't it ? ?
It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game .
He turned to Lester .
He swung round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy ! !
The boy jerked away .
He rode low on the mare's neck .
He did not look back ; ;
He would never reach California .
He was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life .
Mike stripped these from him and donned them .
He and Dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose .
Julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him .
`` Thank you , My dear '' , he said .
First , we've got to get out of here '' .
`` We'll grab horses '' , Dean said .
No doubt there would be men guarding the horses .
`` We'll stampede the rest .
All of you be ready to ride hell for leather '' .
He added , `` If this doesn't work out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them '' .
She clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes .
He felt unutterably weary .
Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms .
She too began to weep .
Mike only said , `` Later '' .
A voice spoke near-at-hand .
Just me '' , Mike said .
Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch .
Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol .
He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body .
The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills .
`` No , but the fat's in the fire '' ! !
He said .
You're the one that's taking the big chance '' .
Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand .
Mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet .
He lifted a screeching war whoop .
`` Apaches '' ! !
Mike yelled .
They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar .
Mike crawled to the door and peered in .
A lantern hung from a peg , giving light .
A brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches .
An ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges .
Bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it .
He shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon .
He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house .
One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack .
Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down .
Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them .
She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks .
The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring .
`` Drag the wagons to the spring '' ! !
A sizable supply of powder had been touched off .
`` So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village '' ! !
For a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb .
First it was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites .
Once we get over the mountains others will come along .
-- Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work ! !
More of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains .
But Oso replied calmly , `` Trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country , rev'rend '' .
The worst part had been the waiting ; ;
I didn't catch a wink .
They poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry .
`` Oso '' , Montero called `` I'll get Gray Eyes '' .
`` Hold your fire '' , Montero was shouting .
I could see them in my sights .
Gray Eyes was in the lead .
As he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse .
At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony .
He jerked once in the grass and lay still .
Oso growled .
Lead up ! !
Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing .
the square head fell over .
They grew louder as the Indians charged again .
`` Gray Eyes is back , , Montero said .
In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger .
This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire .
The horses were only several lengths away when he fired .
A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight .
The ponies were almost uncontrollable .
His eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in .
`` I saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger .
That fire's too big .
It's bigger than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm .
I own the place '' .
The girl laughed .
`` I know him .
He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next .
I have it with me , right here .
I meant what I said about that fire .
That's all .
He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now .
`` Put the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said .
The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him .
`` I said go home , Joseph .
`` Who was that '' ? ?
`` I guess I'll find out soon enough .
He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist .
`` I've had enough of that .
And one had been too many .
He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping .
They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed .
The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it .
good grass , good water .
And there was a house ; ;
And he had a feeling -- thanks to the girl -- that things would get worse before they got better .
He had an uneasy feeling about it .
That girl last night , what was her name ? ?
It was dark and , I sensed , very large ; ;
only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it .
But it was not easy for him and he often slipped .
He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf .
He would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance .
I withdrew my hand .
The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air .
I could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison .
far from it ! !
The sounds issuing from beyond -- winches whirring , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me .
I was at once disappointed , although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained .
But he came toward me sedately enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application .
Why had I registered ? ?
indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them .
These questions did not surprise me ; ;
To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence .
Barton said harshly , `` Why did you do that '' ? ?
They moved slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall .
There was no moon .
`` I've got to have help '' .
No one hurried .
Five miles .
The ex-prison guard was embarrassed .
You're the only man the Night Riders will follow .
The murderer lifted his head .
It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them Night Riders , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure .
Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off , up the river bank .
Twenty years before a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley .
Then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned .
`` The road's washed badly '' , said Dill , `` but there's a trail you can get over with a horse .
Dill was silent as if he hated to answer , and Barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension .
Barton stood up .
I understand how you feel about the child .
Chapter two
It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield .
For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg , and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence .
He lived and breathed for the mining company .
We want him back there or we want him dead '' .
Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully .
They blame us for all their troubles .
We don't want Barton's Night Riders loose again '' .
As she drove , she thought about her plan .
She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest .
If she , Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation .
She remembered little of her previous journey there with Grace , and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it .
Birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun , all dewy-eyed and soft , caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time .
It was not , thought Pamela , such an evil place after all .
She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; ;
The forest took on an impersonal aspect .
She seemed to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees .
She was standing in a thick grove .
Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene ? ?
She already knew this unwholesome , chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive .
She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles .
`` I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord .
She yanked away from him furiously .
Lord nodded agreeably .
So I can hear you while I'm checkin' the car .
He opened the door and got out .
He waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly .
`` Aah , go on '' , she said .
Lips pursed mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side .
And he really feels that way , she thought .
Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone .
He caught her eye , came back around the car with the boot-wearer ; ;
`` Oh , cut it out , Tom '' ! !
`` Can't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute '' ? ?
On the other hand , howsomever , maybe you wouldn't either .
I figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk , and I c'n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours '' .
He pointed , cutting her off .
She saw it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat -- a test well in unexplored country .
sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town .
`` What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ? ?
McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip .
So , `` How about it '' ? ?
He was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable .
Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes .
`` I'll get around to it a little later '' , he mumbled desperately .
Now , he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck .
Fear-maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again .
The Brannon outfit -- known as the Slash-B because of its brand -- reached Hondo Creek before sundown .
Two of the new hands , a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd .
They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie's fire , rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes , lounged about .
But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit .
Conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon .
He'd come alone , without his wife and child .
Elena , you'll get mud all over your dress '' ! !
Conchita wondered .
It bothered her that she probably would never know .
They were considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned .
Let Senora Brannon live in her father's house for a time .
Ten ? ?
`` Maybe in a year , Tomas .
Maybe I should withdraw my advice -- no '' ? ?
You're going to need your woman .
Brannon shook his head .
`` I won't force Beth to come against her will .
They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm .
The Ramirez brothers were also along .
It was dark early , because of the storm .
Red , come along .
`` Not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse .
He was puffing on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain .
`` I'll remember you '' , he said .
`` Key '' ? ?
Come on -- the key .
Macklin balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door .
He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door .
They returned to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street .
`` Don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you '' .
The others followed Brannon inside .
He had cursed at them and threatened them .
He found nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out .
The authorities had to release him .
He immediately rode on to Cheyenne , threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends .
You reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that '' ? ?
For a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do .
A good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats .
`` Fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle '' his own hired man , Andy Ross , mentioned later .
He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast .
Not even an empty cartridge case could be found .
The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement .
`` Sportin' '' ! !
I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill , and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls .
The examples were plain .
All through Albany and Laramie counties , other men were doing the same .
Houses of settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards .
)
He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups .
He moistened his lips uneasily .
`` What is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner '' ? ?
Brenner shrugged carelessly .
`` You're not to mention my name .
He started toward the stairway , then turned to add , `` Tell her to come to Adams's room , that Adams is in trouble .
From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street .
There were two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin .
He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall .
Curt moved over beside the door and waited .
The door swung open , and Jess said sourly , `` What the hell's the matter with you ? ?
''
The horse continued to snort .
Jess caught his breath in surprise .
He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster .
`` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said .
Jess stiffened .
I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; ;
Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun .
Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster .
`` All right , Crouch ; ;
we're on even terms .
`` I ain't drawin' against you '' , Jess said thickly .
I ain't a gunslinger '' .
You're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club .
I just wanted to hear you say so '' .
Pain shot up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit .
He slammed into the wall , bounced back , and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning .
He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them .
When his head came down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall .
You killed him , didn't you '' ? ?
Leaving Jess's where it lay , he left the stall .
Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door .
Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan .
Much as they had to look forward to , they didn't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go .
And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon .
Then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward sags in her careworn face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` Pa ! !
And he's with the Jacksons '' ! !
From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food .
And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , `` Farmer in the dell , Farmer in the dell , Heigh-ho the dairy-oh , the farmer in the dell '' .
For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night .
Gran Harrow exclaimed , watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load .
`` How's Sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising '' ? ?
`` My right leg's stiff as a board this morning '' , he replied .
Captain Clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams .
`` Like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown '' .
Before Harmony had a chance to reply , Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs .
While no larger than Dutch Springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous .
`` Take one side of the street , and I'll take the other '' , he proposed .
Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside .
Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he feverishly scanned the busy street below .
As luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared .
The door was locked .
Russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach .
`` Okay , Stevens .
Cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope waning by the moment .
Pat nodded .
His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful .
`` Shall we get out of here '' ? ?
`` Old Crip wasn't '' , retorted Cobb tartly .
`` He'll know when you tell him .
At the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for Antler .
`` Penny's always glad to see me over there '' , he mused bleakly .
Yet had he not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle .
`` Gyp Carmer couldn't have known about Colcord's money unless he was told -- and who else would have told him '' ? ?
Nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun .
but on the range gunfire had a meaning .
As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch house .
Still a quarter-mile away , the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed .
Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight .
The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close .
Dismounting , Russ looked about hastily .
`` Jumping Jerusalem ! !
Let's get out of here '' ! !
The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless .
Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan .
Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs .
It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes .
The sky glowered down at them .
Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity .
Visibility continued to be limited , and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet .
He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill .
There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run .
Twelve o'clock level '' .
His mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification .
`` Sweeney Blue , hit the deck .
Belton , the one on the right .
Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes .
`` Todman , drop your second element back .
Even as he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy .
Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight .
A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done .
`` They haven't seen us '' .
Perfect , he thought .
His nose up .
It was going to be dangerous .
Eight aircraft in this small box .
Blind fools .
Six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished .
As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them .
He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back .
Sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip .
`` Moriarty '' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone I once more repeated the absurdity , mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced .
Adios '' , I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters .
Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag , I heard : `` Sahjunt Yoorick , meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck '' .
I nodded .
`` Ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in Sante Fe , an y'all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt .
An Ah coudn ansuh him an so Ah said ' Aw right , Ah gay-ess , an his fathuh didn uttuh one wohd an aftuh Huhmun was gone , the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t'gethuh f'ovuh a yeah , onleh an occasional one , but just the same it was behahn mah back , an Ah doan think thet's nahce at all , d'you '' ? ?
Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack , I stepped on the running board ; ;
I seized the rack and made a western-style flying-mount just in time , one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag -- and merely wrecking my camera , I was to discover later -- my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and -- but this is no medical report .
Did I want a beer ? ?
I wouldn't have known the difference .
A big car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning .
High , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof .
with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin --
Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket .
There was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash ; ;
Looking back I saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number .
Two cars came over a crest , their chrome and glass flashing .
And what eyes they were .
I said , `` Do we know each other , Miss '' ? ?
Shall I go on '' ? ?
She smiled .
`` Sure '' .
`` But one word at a time , O.K. '' ? ?
Would you like a drink , or coffee '' ? ?
`` No , thanks '' .
Haven't we haven't I seen you .
Then it hit me .
`` Splendid .
That was a fun one '' .
I mean : Is advertising honest ? ?
`` I couldn't agree with you more '' .
`` Tell me about the murder '' .
`` You got away , didn't you '' ? ?
He caught up with me once and grabbed me , but I was all covered with zing -- it's very slippery , you know '' .
`` You know who the other man was '' ? ?
I was loaded with suds when I ran away , and I haven't had a chance to wash it off .
`` Only when I do it '' .
It'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you .
I looked at my watch .
Time to go , I supposed .
But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected .
Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars .
I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool .
He filled me in .
Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the filming session earlier .
It's a secret .
They were married over the week-end , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty .
She looked more like twenty-five or six .
That she impressed me instantly was obvious ; ;
I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush .
`` I don't know '' , she said .
She said incredulously .
And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead .
`` Don't worry about me .
`` Are you trying to cut your throat '' ? ?
A few minutes later I saw my Uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner .
In the half darkness I approached cautiously , making sure he did not see me .
His hand was large and square and heavily tanned .
Not by the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep ; ;
Her heart , her maternal feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly thrilled by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from Poussin .
( Would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night in one of Walter's marked bars ? ?
Nicolas : `` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? ?
And , as a matter of fact , Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that Munich's early mornings even in summer are laden with dew .
This was surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised .
That long night with Nicolas and marijuana in Venice had opened her eyes .
Even so , it took her several days to force Walter to tell her Nicolas's whereabouts .
`` Dear girl '' , Walter had finally said , `` he writes me that he is sleeping in the English Gardens '' .
The sun grew hotter as it approached the midday .
Families are very interesting .
In the small gallery used as the guests' dining room , Meredith sat down at his place and , as always , began teasing the young waitress .
Yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the Grafin as acknowledgement that here , indeed , was something special .
As she was rather tired this evening , her simple `` Thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control .
veal cutlets : `` Oh , I couldn't possibly eat all this '' ! !
; ;
Fruit compote : `` If you think I would understand it '' ; ;
`` What a beautiful room .
She repeated `` Eurydice '' .
She began to explain , `` There was this poet , in Italy '' He interrupted , `` Please don't judge all poets '' .
suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ;
Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen .
He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel .
He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck .
She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his .
Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up .
`` We're lost and burning up already '' , she bit out tensely .
`` Hettie '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we're still headed west .
'' She repeated .
It had been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out .
It wasn't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her .
It had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother .
She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder .
He darkened under his heavy burn .
His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead .
And goaded the oxen as he yelled .
`` You had better get inside '' , he warned her .
The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel .
The water level was higher than their hubs .
Now and then , the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past .
Out of compulsion to say something cheery , Ben Prime blurted , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit .
At least , the wheels dug in .
The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' .
She did not call out .
They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend .
It speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up-jutting branch turned slowly .
The spokes were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece .
Hope surged within him .
He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee .
Their jams and jellies had not suffered .
Now , roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep , not knowing what to do .
The lifeboats were stuck fast .
The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare .
our muscles were hot wires of pain .
I'd rather keep bailing -- or sink '' .
There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly : `` I see your point , Pauson .
A half-hour passed ; ;
It is their tultul , the ' jumping platform ' of death .
But he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked .
Thirty minutes later , the outrigger grated on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder .
There was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick .
It took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one .
You've ruined me , blast you '' ! !
but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived .
In the hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases .
For an anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information .
( Her account was later confirmed by the Scobee-Frazier Expedition from the University of Manitoba in 1951 .
Few passed '' .
`` Karipo's women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here .
For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened .
Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at fault , Ramey thought .
`` You mean dream '' ? ?
`` Not exactly .
Never Benny .
`` He wasn't in the car '' , Ramey said .
`` You didn't go clear around '' , Benson said .
The insurance man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town .
She might have been someone he had once loved .
Their work was lonely .
`` What's she doing in this bunch '' ? ?
Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .
It made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on .
The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's leg .
Them's brains '' .
he laid all four knuckles in between the man's cheekbone and his chin .
With a thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him .
None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .
A shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again .
Ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman .
He walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him .
His brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it .
Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head -- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute .
Seven years they'd been married .
`` Yes '' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime .
`` The snake was beautiful , wasn't it '' ? ?
''
All of us , that is , except me .
He became a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates .
It was a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior .
There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along .
They stood there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast .
That was his true love , not Penny .
The sambur buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk .
Peacocks strutted across their path , preening .
Robinson clambered heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly .
`` Temper , temper '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , laughing uneasily .
A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten A.M.
So instead I come up '' .
`` Well , I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder .
And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .
A note of awe came into his voice .
`` Pressure-happy '' , Artie said , and climbed in .
He had his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him .
`` Maybe not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , Artie said .
`` It's nothing to fool with .
`` Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive '' .
`` He's one hell of a decent boy .
Waddell turned to face him .
Waddell was not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard .
He asked .
We spoke of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity .
He was most eager to make the dive ; ;
`` On the basis of the facts '' .
`` You will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said .
`` At 200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him .
Yes ! !
I guess you're right '' .
And make my life different and better from this time on .
He felt a good deal less shaky .
`` You know I know it '' , Robinson answered warily .
`` I don't think you should go down again '' .
Early that day Matsuo saw a marine .
He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting .
today ; ;
His comrades were all dead .
He had no rice .
He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk .
His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife .
The knife , an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt .
The callous marines had laughed at each other's retching , while stacking bodies .
whispers : he heard none of these .
Hush followed .
Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes .
With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop .
The bobbing head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk .
They could come on him now without difficulty .
Maintaining his clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets .
He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; ;
From its holder he took his own canteen .
`` You came well equipped to die '' .
Drunk on sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac .
He waited in his squat , gripping the hair .
Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight .
First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes .
A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist .
Matsuo stood up .
He cupped his mouth and yelled .
Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die .
Matsuo laughed , slung the rifle .
The marine was a winehead .
he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .
He began to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads .
Matsuo shook his head .
I've nothing for you '' .
Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar .
`` I'm Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .
Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor .
I've come for Pat Conyers' body '' .
Blue Throat won't stand for this .
He'll shoot up the town '' .
Billy Tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle .
`` I'm gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window '' .
Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back .
Billy Tilghman did just that .
It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie .
Citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century .
Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang .
They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses .
Seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn .
Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .
The rancher was trembling .
`` Follow the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely .
`` Jed's homestead is on the south bank '' .
If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .
That place is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang '' .
she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately .
He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .
when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do .
Tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress .
Something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ;
Once ( this was on the third day of school ) she kneeled down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg .
`` I'll get her yet '' , he muttered to himself .
She said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .
He considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .
A nude imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind .
`` Hell , I jist got on top of -- ''
`` No , I mean how'd you get her to do it '' ? ?
`` Hell , yes .
`` Let's go inside '' .
`` No , not now '' , said the teacher .
Come inside now '' .
At noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball .
`` I'd druther stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned .
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .
`` O.K. '' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls .
They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap .
While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` Gosh , I'm sorry , Miss Langford .
He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .
`` All right , if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling .
The youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman .
Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum .
He showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy .
He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr. Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South's oldest and most cherished names .
Delphine was a pace-setter in high society .
But Dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in Bayou St. John .
The woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection .
`` What is your name , boy ? ?
Come a bit closer .
Then he smiled shyly .
Mrs. Lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage .
`` Aristide ! !
If the old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer .
Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .
It will rip and shred easily for Madame '' .
`` Quite so , my dear .
The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave .
He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber .
When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner's basket .
It was Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him .
He must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced .
Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die .
Such a pitiful end '' ! !
Moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans' dives .
The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .
They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !
`` Bastards '' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me '' ! !
Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .
That was the day it ended .
A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .
Zingggg-O ! !
He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .
They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .
He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .
`` What is with this vow jazz '' ? ?
`` Well , congratulations '' .
Feathertop was a connoisseur .
`` Come sit '' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .
Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .
Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .
`` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .
Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' .
He looked up and grinned .
Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .
So we ran away '' .
She looked down at her hands , too .
Ernie's eyebrows went up .
`` Oh he was stupid , her old man ! !
Ernie nodded .
A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .
Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .
Ernie hesitated a moment .
`` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .
He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .
He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .
And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle .
He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat .
Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .
Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; ;
Or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights .
Filippo Rossi , that's what he was called in the old country ; ;
But this was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders .
The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened .
Once the Old Man had had a wife .
It could have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled .
What did it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals ? ?
To him they were one and the same .
Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .
Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .
They kept him alive , waiting .
Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' ! !
His head undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats .
With his mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it .
But the boy could see only the goat's belly .
There would be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due .
`` It seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , Eugenia said .
`` You might set up a dress shop in the living room '' .
`` What about a tea room , then ? ?
`` I wish I had three wishes '' , Maggie said .
about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day .
Just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster .
They lived mainly in the kitchen ; ;
`` You said a mouthful '' , Eugenia said grimly .
`` You're working up to something , and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression '' .
Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in .
''
`` Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , Mamma .
`` In Brace's room ! !
I drove him away .
She was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable .
If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .
Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace .
But there were great satisfactions , even for a small man .
But this last time he drank not to Brace but `` To Tolley '' ! !
It didn't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say , `` Howdy , Miss Jenny '' , adding a careless `` Roy '' , but it did her .
`` You could try .
Gunny invariably tried to bite her .
`` Stand back , Miss Jen , she's oneasy of your scarf '' .
`` She was mighty good to you past times , an' this'll fetch her '' .
But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz couldn't have been very cordial , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there .
More and more , these days , she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to Tillie's and Nick's -- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies .
It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss Sis had given him , to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs. Robards and the children .
`` A swell party , send an invite to ever'body but them -- those folks you met at the Galt House , the ones I've got to know in this new Jockey Club affair , the whole dang neighborhood .
''
She'll relish the sight of a friendly face .
Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .
Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty's flair for drama , especially through the long summers .
there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; ;
It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` Thank God your poor mother was spared this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles' hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know .
Mama was vulnerable ; ;
She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .
Only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty's bed -- she found herself examining how others might regard her .
The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .
She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .
He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time .
My dad did it , and he lived to a great age '' .
She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away .
`` Not so well's I remember you '' , he said .
`` Can't blame a man for leavin' his wife '' , he said quite cheerfully .
He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .
She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .
`` He's lowly today '' , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up .
`` It ain't an idea '' ! !
`` If it ain't an idea '' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water '' ? ?
Come on now '' .
Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` Dorothy Tredding '' seemed suddenly impossible .
She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .
Most of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South .
Tommy Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions .
It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ;
There was nothing wrong with her job .
Such as now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the Officers' Club , having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime .
She had changed into a cocktail dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck .
Probably off one of the carriers -- an aviator .
`` Harro , girl-san '' ! !
`` You catchee boy-furiendo ? ?
Maybe you likee date with me '' ? ?
It hadn't been this way in college , or in nurses' training ; ;
Now , having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , Tommy was being humiliated at every turn .
She looked around , self-consciously .
Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` Bifutek-san '' ! !
One had to have friends , and a congenial life in after-duty hours .
Tommy , of course , had never heard of a kotowaza , or Japanese proverb , which says , `` Tanin yori miuchi '' , and is literally translated as `` Relatives are better than strangers '' .
He remained young at heart , with an overdeveloped sense of humor .
This deprived him of liberty in Hong Kong , but he told Boats McCafferty that Hong Kong was a book he had read before , and the Navy would always bring him there again , some day .
There were two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the Naval Base , and visit an old shipmate .
`` Well , Doc , you old sonofabitch '' ! !
Grab a taxi '' .
He threw a smart salute at the gangway , went up the dock , and turned down the wide street in front of the Petty Officers' Club .
Perhaps a packing trip into the Sierras , let his beard grow -- but that was too stark .
`` I went over to the Willows and dropped two notes '' .
Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to Reno for stag dinners .
`` Thanks '' , Owen said , `` but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen '' .
`` Yes '' , Owen called out .
Ahah , he thought , a lush divorcee at last .
There was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye .
`` They are a very difficult group of people '' .
`` Oh , I just come once a week .
Every day I visit a different hotel .
They travel in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day '' .
Not that religion isn't big business ; ;
It sounded silly ; ;
Can't you help them '' ? ?
I'll think it over '' .
He showered , shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast .
There was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued .
when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach .
The mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons , who appeared much more animated than the gamblers .
A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place .
`` What you need is a steady martingale '' , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play .
`` I'm just logging '' , the cowboy explained .
But roulette's not my game .
`` Nice to know you .
This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx , so he walked on down to Hurrays , an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf .
`` We're all going over to Lake Tahoe and try our luck at Cal-Neva '' , Buzz explained , still instigating .
He started out as a stickman , then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading .
`` Well , okay '' , Buzz said .
Naval procedure , he thought , had its moments of grim humor .
And it was clear that Adrien was not mistaken , for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till Philip Spencer had given the signal to obey .
Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work .
Tillotson had reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , brandishing the weapon .
`` There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners .
Besides , suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what ? ?
Do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now '' ? ?
We are going to be rushed and murdered '' .
A great deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed '' .
And when he was alone again in the cabin , Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done .
He who had tried so hard , who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer .
Only Cromwell , the giant boatswain , was mild-mannered and respectful .
Captain , I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' .
Before God I swear I am innocent .
He leaned closer to Alexander , squinting up at him from the deck .
`` And do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word '' ? ?
`` I thought '' , Midshipman Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry '' .
A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides .
He wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles .
His black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high .
I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms .
His hands were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and , pivoting on his heel , he entered an old stone building .
We entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor .
We stepped inside .
The guttural language from the ghetto stopped .
His body pitched back and forth on the bench .
I shuddered and backed out of the room .
Rachel followed , looked at me , and clucked with her tongue .
She passed by him .
I didn't look at him .
She smiled to herself .
I resented them .
But when she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the kibbutzim .
It was an impulse when she was here in Me'a She'arim -- I was with her -- that led her to stay in Israel .
Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos .
Rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace .
Who loved her .
There was a man here in town .
She worked very hard .
She came to me one day .
And she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to Reuveni and accepted his proposal .
He took her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was .
The two of them against the world .
`` Did I see him about to swing low in a chariot ? ?
Maybe I saw him on a barge with a gang of Ethiopians poling it '' .
Out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving .
And the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when Gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened .
Or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night .
Even when he is on the way to Memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you .
And you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't afford and the too-shiny shoes .
It comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have Gratt Shafer ; ;
You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you .
The others , the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York City .
There was no lock because Herman didn't allow a lock .
A lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping .
Among us , we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs .
Each of us had his own specialty besides .
I did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints : naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver .
McKenzie , the art editor , took one look at my finished sketch and said , `` Nothing doing , Rufus .
In the end , I did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a sword instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie .
As for Donald , he actually sold paintings .
It wasn't just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself .
instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade .
We went into Mrs. Monmouth's library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a Modigliani portrait , a Jackson Pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background , that looked like an inscription from a Martian tomb .
`` By yourself '' ? ?
`` Painting isn't this big , you know .
It is as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' .
`` What do you study '' ? ?
I was fascinated ; ;
I nodded .
`` I'm also studying enameling with Hajime Iijima '' , he went on , `` and twice a week I go to a life class taught by Pendleton '' .
`` My God , is he still alive ? ?
I went to a retrospective of his work when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne's '' .
And he is a great man .
In the Middle Ages , in the Renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world .
It was an awkward hour , but I didn't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job .
It was mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us .
`` Why should Via have it '' ? ?
Had she forgotten she had signed the car away , that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children ? ?
I didn't want to stir things up .
I'll call her '' .
`` No , thank you .
`` It narrows down down down and finally there is no way out .
If I am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing '' .
I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in .
`` Don't bother , Ida '' , she said .
And I went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life .
I did my shopping , had my dentist appointment , and from there I went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual Christmas bazaar , so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home in the late afternoon .
Dolly Engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us .
`` She's nowhere , nowhere '' ! !
And after I brought them sandwiches and coffee I had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait .
But I didn't really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else .
Or what was it that , before Via , Sonny , Walter and all , I began almost to dance with shuddering and cry out , `` I knew she'd do it ! !
I added .
The funeral service was in the house , the Methodist minister , how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside , a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words , and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment , seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed .
Together we waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New Jersey .
`` Oh , I'd drink with newspaper people .
Pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question .
`` You talk so well , Carla '' , he went on .
`` What is this '' ? ?
The cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing .
`` What's the matter with them '' ? ?
She no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in Parioli .
You could take me to St. Peter's '' .
Then he thought of those Old Testament figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
Being a woman though , she would take only what she needed from church .
Let's be fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were joking .
Agnese , smiling too , said , `` 'ello '' , and then more slowly , `` I am happy '' .
Carla translated .
Regretfully Sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars .
Now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes .
Yes , the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint .
He saw her emerge suddenly , coming in her unhesitant fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach .
Telling you '' ! !
`` Go take helsq'iyokom , your evil spirit , to the young boys '' , the woman said .
`` They do not have to face battle .
He shouted .
And Early Spring seized the whip and said :
But the old man turned on her , jerking the whip from her hand .
I will be the one to confront my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin '' ! !
They all know your foolish name '' ! !
Sssshoo '' ! !
Move from the line or I will settle the whip on you .
They came out and held their games and races .
He would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction , because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices .
They combed their hair and streaked it at the part and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making love .
And those of Early Spring , haunted and now full of hurt and envy .
They would ride with streaming amulets , their colors ripening in the sun , shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death .
They mounted their horses and rode off into the hills .
Standing then with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , multicolored legion , their hair flying like dark banners , only the thunder , the roll of drums , the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them .
The sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears .
She felt as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ;
and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her .
Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees .
I wish I were older or younger , Julia Bentley thought .
It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ;
The fabric was dark ; ;
She must have put his clothes in the closet .
He peered at his wristwatch .
Strange , it was still running .
This was some freak , two strands of adhesive tape across his nose , like ugly roots from the mass of gauze , suddenly moist over his cheekbones .
He'd have to think , but the main thing , the imperative necessity , was to leave before Sam Bentley was up and about , and before Millie detained him with sympathy .
A plane up in the sky , above the clouds , and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away .
He was trying to smile at her .
Just about to call a taxi '' .
`` You're leaving '' ? ?
I just don't want anyone disturbed , Julie .
He raised them .
`` Not to anyone '' ? ?
He could hear the footsteps overhead .
Outside the Lincoln was parked .
Pietro was gazing at him in an insolent , disdainful fashion ; ;
He took her hand .
He asked .
I'm supposed to joke about things , aren't I ? ?
`` Take care of yourself then '' .
You , also .
In the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp .
Just one or two swallows , he told himself , enough to lessen some of the pain .
Yes , sure , I'll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist .
There was one more call to make .
He asked .
He'll understand -- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge .
`` Don't even send flowers .
I'll see you Wednesday .
Okay ? ?
She had two tiny rooms on the second floor .
It wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers , of course ; ;
`` Not yet .
`` Darling '' -- she said , and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend .
It seemed to Lucy that all their married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life .
`` I wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said unhappily , `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever '' .
Get moving '' ! !
their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them .
`` There isn't a chance of Myra's letting anything like that happen .
But they weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ;
`` Well , at last '' , she said , because Susan was clattering down the stairs .
His voice had sharp edges , as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment .
Nice '' ? ?
She had let Jim go with a chilly good-by , a chillier kiss .
The handsome bird was solitary ; ;
the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels .
How long would it be occupied ? ?
As long as the unscrupulous Myra chose ? ?
since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed .
`` I can imagine '' ! !
for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be napping now , surrounded by her multitude of dolls .
`` Just for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them '' .
Once the soft , pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted ? ?
Suddenly , seekingly , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know '' ? ?
Then she jumped to her feet , the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake .
For Lucy , the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end .
Cowbird Myra ! !
Unlike Susan , she was traveling light ; ;
they would have to buy things for her .
)
He was a knight of the Round Table , `` Sir Quintus the Brave '' , slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses .
) He was the first astronaut on the moon , chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature .
It's all right .
He could remember the feel of his father's big hands , the thump of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar .
Wait and see , Dad '' .
Or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime : `` Please , Lord Gord , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised '' .
Quint said now to the clouds .
He unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg .
`` Goolick , goooolick '' , creaked a sea gull .
I'm scared of the nightmare .
`` Why didn't you duck '' ? ?
He snapped .
She was sore as a boil .
`` Ever hear of squatter's rights '' ? ?
That's short for Quintus .
`` My mother never wops me .
`` Dingy-looking '' , was what she said .
Come home or I'll come find you '' .
`` So do I .
They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter .
Same time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ;
`` Name one , I been there '' .
As for dancing -- holy mackerel , he ought to see the gypsies in Jerez ; ;
She made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so .
that he personally had an IQ of 141 and was currently reading the Mushr to Ozon volume of the encyclopedia .
Tooth-hurty '' .
He snuck up on the ham like Maggie , gumming it with soft , stumpy teeth , then panting with thirst , lapping up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , staggering home to be sick , while his mother said , `` That does it .
He hadn't .
`` You can't serve cod and salmon '' .
Sometimes they argued .
But Victoria began yodeling just then and he went home , carrying Sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , smelling of peppermints .
`` He says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane .
`` Children , we'll have to get organized .
The cave in his stomach hurt .
He had to go into the water .
It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung .
The unbearable weight on his chest ? ?
Didn't John Cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life ? ?
Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the rebound .
For it had been John and Linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the Golf Club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs .
John-and-Linda were at Longue Vue last night ; ;
You still said `` John-and-Linda '' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or Dillinger .
It got worse instead of better .
There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either .
She is frivolous and scatterbrained , but she really isn't shallow '' .
Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at their wedding .
John was good at his job .
Bobbie had been successful , too , though he didn't match John's pace , and after all he didn't need to , with all the Stuart money .
He and Linda settled down to being social leaders , and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year .
It might be rough on Edythe at first , but Linda and John between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her , to send her back to Cleveland or anywhere .
And Linda felt capable of capturing the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and Bobbie had had none of their own .
It would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of .
Of course , he had done wonders .
Alloy steels and regular steels had different sales departments at Smith & MacIsaacs , where John and Bobbie both worked .
Bobbie had been head of the alloy division , while John was just another good salesman in the regular branch .
She asked Bobbie .
He was a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision .
She called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night .
`` That's swell '' , I said sweetly .
`` Janice , nobody answers at the apartment '' ! !
`` Oh , she wouldn't do that '' , I said .
`` I can't leave the party ! !
We're at Ken Thom's apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat ! !
Old Mr. Thom is already down on Wally , and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us '' --
Why should I go over at midnight to check on Francie , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party ? ?
I'll be glad to pay you '' --
`` All right '' , I said .
But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if I didn't go over , who would ? ?
I dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened .
I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone .
But then I looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk .
I must have dozed off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices .
Nadine's , shrill with anger -- Wally's loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two .
I grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right , and she was crazy .
`` You stay out of this '' , she spat at me .
`` you'd better simmer down '' , I said nervously .
All we own is Francie's bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe on them .
`` Stop that ! !
Whether or not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine .
Thankful I wasn't Nadine .
I -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' --
`` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman '' ! !
`` Things may smooth over yet '' , Chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern .
They had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their necks , owing on everything they owned .
I just stared at him .
`` I know we'd be pretty crowded .
Then I felt uncomfortable , too .
But , darn it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us ? ?
The finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name .
But the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us .
He set out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of alibis and excuses .
And for the thousandth time , I answered myself .
A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at .
But once I was alone again , driving to the hospital , the heaviness returned .
If she and Pete were really getting serious , I'd have to do some hard thinking .
Pete was down on Seven , Dick told me , and he'd meet us there .
She looked about sixty , though I recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four .
I never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it relaxes them , I've always thought , to chat first .
She shook her head .
That done , I told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind .
One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled .
Class Three , they said .
We'll do a D. and C. and get her permission for a hysterectomy .
`` We'd like you to have a dilatation and curettage .
It was flat , definite .
`` Suppose you let me explain .
But there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke .
Think I'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife ? ?
I'd found my voice .
The last thing I remember is a bar in San Diego '' --
What she'd said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me .
She made me welcome .
While a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part sorted over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time .
I stared .
She was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress .
I feel another of terrible urgency .
I had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils ( so help me ) , then switched to Tuborg .
All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space .
Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick .
It gave her poise and posture .
`` Is it a woman '' ? ?
I even snorted a chuckle .
`` Now isn't it better to smile '' ? ?
I could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit .
With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom .
`` Why , to brush your teeth '' .
`` Oh '' ? ?
It was a nice place , not filled with smoke .
The sommelier brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle I had ordered .
I fixed him with a steely eye and said , `` What's this for ? ?
An enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead .
She would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight .
Other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above , watching the azaleas mass , or just enjoying the sun .
Content excited ; ;
Presently , she picked up the first of the letters .
Her Cousin Emma Carraway had written it , in her loose high old lady's script -- t's carefully crossed , but l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope .
But alas George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec's funeral .
Could it just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? ?
They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan .
Can you think of anything to do '' ? ?
''
They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick .
The man did not wish to leave .
Was he ever successful , Theresa wondered .
She cast about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed ! !
Finally , she scurried away up the steps .
''
I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck .
I guess she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on Johnnie , my Johnnie .
But by the time the first crackling of spring came around , we both knew we were hopelessly in love .
`` It's so crazy '' , I told him once .
`` And you fall for a lumber jockey '' .
He examined his nails carefully .
I huddled miserably beside him in the truck .
It was all my doing -- his seeing her .
Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it .
But then he had said , `` All right , kid , if that's how you want it , that's how it'll be '' .
My very first time .
`` Uh huh .
`` Mmm '' .
`` It can't be wrong , can it ? ?
And if I could contribute to that , I'd do it .
He was plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half .
But I'd been a good girl and now God was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared .
From the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming , members of the Young Christians' League , and I'd been chosen to represent our chapter .
After the meeting , there was going to be a party at someone's house .
`` Need a pumpkin to get to the party '' ? ?
`` Well , I should find Alma '' -- I began .
Not for me '' .
`` No -- really '' .
But at least come along while I get lubricated '' .
Under normal circumstances , he had a certain bright-eyed all-American-boy charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs .
Share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ?
She had explained it -- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units .
This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it .
`` Lots of sun , lots of rest .
but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it .
Meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet , the doctor's prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery .
She bellowed triumphantly .
He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists .
Said this note .
He didn't want to encourage anything here ; ;
Somebody had .
Eh '' ? ?
`` What's that you say '' ? ?
`` My , you're peaked .
I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur .
That pale kind , Charlie thought .
When Charlie came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill , the whole establishment ( gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a floodlit modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color , punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators .
He could not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside Peony , Larkspur , and the rest .
No wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes .
Thanks '' , was her answer the next day .
He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper .
But then , redheads are often pale .
He stuck his head in Mrs. Kirby's little rental office .
He spent that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit .
Finally , in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , filched her hand lotion , and left a note .
He didn't know what was so tough about Vivian's world , slopping around Nassau with what's-his-name .
Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion .
Correspondence passed back and forth .
`` I'm not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair '' .
There are two things here about Surviving in the Wilderness , and a book called ' Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe ' ; ;
Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher .
The game was resumed .
He simply turned to Mike and smiled .
This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I'll get that little bastard .
The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate .
All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher .
Both fell heavily to the ground .
Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side .
`` Stop it , will you ? ?
`` That's what you say '' .
The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat .
Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him .
`` Hit the bum '' ! !
Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench .
When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in .
He stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now .
Mike went over to Phil and stood over him .
`` Listen , wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy '' .
Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face .
`` I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly .
`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ? ?
He sat down before Eddie's desk .
`` I'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly .
`` Listen ! !
`` Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie said .
`` Now listen to me , Phil .
Suddenly his voice grew hard .
You're not in the big leagues , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there '' ? ?
Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short .
But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with .
I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it .
Phil shut the door behind him .
Outside in the dressing room , Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes .
Phil shrugged .
They were silent for a few moments .
`` Hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later .
The leagues are full of guys like that '' .
What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ? ?
He just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that .
He needs outfielders bad '' .
And one day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled The Book of the Dead , which she suspected Richard would enjoy .
`` Did you think there were two '' ? ?
He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .
It was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it .
In time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity .
No one had .
Sushi was Out because it was pretentious .
`` Did you watch him '' ? ?
Sam , I thought you knew everything about Tokyo .
`` I've heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said .
`` Twenty-two or twenty-three '' .
He found himself trying to remember something , but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall .
He was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned .
On the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of Fudo , or perhaps a demon .
The sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach .
Suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple , never looking back .
It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch .
His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth .
You are much too beautiful .
He was eleven and we had done many things together .
He asked , as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me .
I pointed to the splintered , upright stake .
`` Why did you kill it '' ? ?
`` You know there are no poisonous snakes in this area .
The snake was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life .
I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live .
I said .
`` It's an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said .
But due to the many applicants on file , would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? ?
Besides , Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the old-grad-type .
Cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride .
How do you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? ?
What a production to make of a letter commending your own son ! !
He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics .
`` Going to State '' ? ?
So sorry .
`` No , I begged off .
Work to do '' .
David grinned .
Carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` Mr. Chairman '' ! !
`` Hear anything from Hanford yet , Dad '' ? ?
Cady begged the question .
Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys .
Anne said it wasn't surprising because Charles was antisocial , a lone wolf , and completely one-sided .
`` I know you wrote this in a hurry , but , Cady , Dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days .
`` And he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club .
Those aren't his interests now '' .
Just what '' ? ?
But subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold .
Give him time '' .
He had always been a messy and negligent man .
Or against her back , pressed on the column of vertebrae , which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding , until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises , like the snapped stem of a tulip .
He saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly .
There was too little occasion beforehand for resistance , the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting .
It was almost too easy .
Martin strained his ears .
At first he could not be sure .
Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there .
Clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' .
He remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends , lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening .
But his mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , pallid ears .
Here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by .
Others asked .
While he waited in the living room .
Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment .
Everyone would know why ; ;
Nothing would change , nothing would ever change .
In a frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan .
Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same .
The knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism .
Isn't his racket down your alley '' ? ?
How did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ?
Cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and Freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences .
The future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade -- one jet can take the place of three compound-engine planes .
Can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles '' ? ?
Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged .
Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already .
He assures me he has people to handle the money raising , and Ham Richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of Zenith and Allstates are no problem .
I don't like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution '' .
`` Yes , I appreciate that .
I wish you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm lukewarm ; ;
allied to them was Gerry , devoting much time to swaying her father , and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was unwilling to interfere further .
Initially , Hamrick's reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was discouraging .
I hate that .
Move over , General Motors '' .
Let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction , at reasonable rates .
We've got rid of the steam yachts and Georgian houses , and the bloated , too-expensive automobile is next .
Why not come down smartly in the world , in a chic fashion , with an Allstates-Zenith '' ? ?
He swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on .
`` Nobody will underwrite it , I'm telling you '' , Freddy said .
`` All right '' , William said .
You're up against it anyhow .
He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his hands together .
`` All the in-laws have got to have their day '' , Adam said , and glared at William and Freddy in turn .
Spike-haired , burly , red-faced , decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an Ivy League suit , Jack Hamrick awaited William at the officers' club .
`` I'm afraid not '' .
) , had listed himself for Mormon Beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said : `` With your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies '' ! !
Thus it was that Barco , apprehended for mere larceny , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered .
At first Barco was evasive and shifty .
He directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica .
Orders were given to dig .
Welch was wild with delight .
His elation grew as Barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another .
Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him .
Once there , the D.A. with devilish cleverness would provide Marshall with headlines : `` Viola's Multiple Romances '' `` Viola Lake an Addict '' `` Downfall of Another Film Idol '' ! !
while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as Fate would have it , belonged to District Attorney Welch .
In the first place , it was difficult for us to meet .
The most that was accomplished was adding Mrs. Beige's tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an ascending scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion .
Somehow managing to get out a cool , poised , `` Won't you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including Devil's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia .
Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice .
I discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room .
Resolving to get something done , I started in on the dishes .
They were `` personalities '' .
Bermuda was not in style that year .
`` You are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , Fran had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but People Who Do Things '' .
Francesca and Herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their Colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) .
It seemed , indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement .
I wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally unreal .
If Blanche had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , valueless things .
They were `` sincere '' -- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile .
`` O ! !
Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand .
The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills Mama had been providing .
How dared they demand to `` snoop '' in private financial records , disbursements , confidential contracts and agreements ? ?
`` It is as though '' , I said on the historic three-hour , coast-to-coast radio broadcast which I bought ( following Father Coughlin and pre-empting the Eddie Cantor , Manhattan Merry-go-round and Major Bowes shows ) `` That Man in the White House , like some despot of yore , insisted on reading my diary , raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie ! !
But what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation ? ?
It was then that I availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional .
But the Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case ! !
Heywood Broun wrote : `` Belle Poitrine is the most original thinker since Caligula '' , and even F.D.R. had to concede that `` if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss Poitrine , America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh '' .
Even though I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled .
( But that is another story .
With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse .
a `` splash party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ;
As Mrs. Letch Feeley , was it any wonder that I , once the social arbiter of Filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires , the Coopers , the Gables , the Colmans , the Rathbones , the Taylors , the Thalbergs and such devout , closely knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys ? ?
Our last joint venture , Sainted Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother Cabrini , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of America's first saint in November , 1938 , was a fiasco from start to finish .
But in order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing ruffian who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother Cabrini .
Did he trouble to memorize the very small part which I had `` tailor-made '' to his specifications , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ? ?
In a rare fit of anger and spite , I `` farmed out '' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment .
In clothes , Letch simply did not project .
( I watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later .
)
And then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them .
This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting .
At least he could buy the equipment for his workshop .
How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? ?
Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench .
After that everything should be simpler .
Carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job .
While Mr. Blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench , Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar .
Mr. Blatz agreed that this would be pretty .
There was no question of that .
`` I was just sayin' to him that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' .
There are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies .
One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition .
Another woman , addressing Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we '' ? ?
`` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend .
`` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have misunderstood me '' .
Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician .
The obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks .
`` Senator '' , said an interviewer , `` your constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' .
A verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain : `` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a drunken spree .
`` Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on '' ? ?
Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips .
`` Officials Meet on rubbish .
Many Shapes in bathtubs .
We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' .
The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields .
When a customer asked for alligator shoes , she said , `` What size is your alligator '' ? ?
`` Oh , I'm so delighted to meet you '' , she gushed .
`` Yes , sir '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ? ?
Where were you '' ? ?
The daughter replied , `` Oh , I had dinner with -- well , you don't know him but he's awfully nice -- and we went to a couple of places -- I don't suppose you've heard of them -- and we finished up at a cute little night club -- I forget the name of it .
Why , it's all right , isn't it , Mother '' ? ?
It is but so-so '' .
`` A blue suit '' , he answered .
The moonlit night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time .
Replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre .
Another less ambiguous case read as follows : `` The bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction .
If you are thinking of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' .
`` Comedy didn't die , it just went crazy .
`` I woke up this morning '' , Moreland said , `` paraphrasing Lewis Carroll .
Do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? ?
In our present era of Science and Angst , the heart has been downgraded , to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs '' .
Like almost everybody else , he confused the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the deranged glands , and the jumpy central nervous system .
`` Too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock '' .
Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' .
My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ;
`` Oh , that is demonstrable '' , I told him .
`` You think the Russians are getting ahead of us in comedy '' ? ?
Nevertheless , like any other human being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually , Khrushchev , the anti-personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has .
Moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again , and then came back and sat down , restively .
`` Great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , I said .
One day , the children had wanted to get up onto General Burnside's horse .
Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time .
Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' .
Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ;
First , Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults .
`` This is a warm-up '' .
Then , Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful .
But they kept on clapping for a long , long time .
Their father , when he came back from those many business trips , just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox .
Or his horse .
They also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling .
`` I'm sorry , Mrs. Minks '' , Arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it .
`` It's perfectly understandable , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way .
and Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open .
She would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting .
Later on , the children told her further about somersaulting .
`` It must be awfully good for them .
`` I reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress .
I have no notion why I reached .
Was it an omen ? ?
nobody could have told why .
The children loathed him , too .
This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them .
Possibly , the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration .
Eh '' ? ?
He was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs .
Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command .
My mother was beside herself with curiosity .
`` You what '' ? ?
He would not look up .
According to the myth , Old Order then vanishes at stage left and reappears at extreme stage right , but Director Shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply having Miss Arapacis walk across the stage .
In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against the English at Dunkirk .
But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc Schlek , Jr. , a major revival is under way .
As he leads the Neurenschatz Skolkau Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor's insistence .
Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention .
Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born Free , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max Fink's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My Friend , the Quizzical Salamander .
Done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother's pet salamander , Alicia .
In this country , the two guiding lights are , without doubt , Felix Fing and Anna Pulova .
Miss Pulova has a voice that Maria Callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw driver '' , and her round , opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of Rosalie .
I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity .
Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior .
Hastening to the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there .
Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let's resume our catalogue .
Inscribed around its base is a charm in Balinese , a dialect I take it you don't comprehend .
Sort of remorseless , isn't it ? ?
you're tooling around full of gage in your hot rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like Ubermenschen .
In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap .
`` Now he's bought it '' , said my wife contentedly .
His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. Grimesby Roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band .
The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off .
His hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the top .
Not long ago , I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio City ; ;
`` See that guy '' ? ?
you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva .
