If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session .
The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .
Future clouded
With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election .

At Berger's direction , the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there .

`` I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' .
The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations .
He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned .
But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe .
Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words :
The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 .
Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament .
The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent .
Moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos .
In Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep .
As a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure .
`` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries .
The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy .
The question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East .
The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development .
The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship .
The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers '' are needed but that a different brand is called for .
In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities .
It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' .
It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university '' : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension .
Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences .
The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group '' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself .
Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision making .

The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment .
But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders .
Under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted .
In other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday .
The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 .

The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .
As early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ;
In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared :
`` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ;
It was most effective against trade unions .
The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment .
In 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity .
The law could not suspend economics .
`` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President .
`` In view of the present situation in Laos '' , said the Pentagon's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific '' .
`` The important thing from now on '' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia '' .
There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi .
( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell .
Said he : `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here '' .
) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective .
In a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ) .
) In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash .
Question at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ?

As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears .
He did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost .
When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet .
Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place .
Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case .
He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 .
Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami .
It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course .
( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe .
Player immediately proceeded to follow suit .
He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways .
When Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime .
Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal .
In the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched .
To better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish .
as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( `` Sometimes in the minors '' , Maris recalls , `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma '' ) .
Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger .
Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's `` Tropic of Cancer '' .
Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking .
A reporter asked Maris recently .
This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer .
Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken .
I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk ' '' .
Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen .
) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell : `` I'm not learning anything on the bench .
Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ;
Only two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first place .
Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard Armory .
As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10,000 each .
The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles .
Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands .
`` I'm a slob '' , he announced .
`` I appreciate beauty '' .
Last week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause .
He made his fortune during World War 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom .
Break in Georgia
The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color .
Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback .
Catch for Chicago
Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted .
At Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 .
The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects .
The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate .
To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ;
In Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner '' .

The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name .
Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many .
Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations .
Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country .
The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo .
On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country .

It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo .
Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York .
But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country .
From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action .

On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) .
however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote .
in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' .

Congress : more muscle
) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order .
The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities .
Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes .
Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward .
However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend .
For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high .
Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward .
In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 .
Higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study .
Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes .
Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years .
`` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. .
Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports .
An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy .
Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting .
The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons .
In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry .
Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets .
Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines .
The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in .
In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis .
Because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works .
Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts .
Each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency .
Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 .
The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service .
Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library .
Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups .
In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ;
Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society .
The General Assembly , which adjourns today , has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened .
Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action .
No action has been taken , however , on such major problems as ending the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales .
The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions .
This strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war .
This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity .
It includes a raise in the county minimum wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance .
Somewhere , somebody is bound to love us
Confidence in the state's economic future is reflected in the Georgia Power Company's record construction budget for this year .
Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year , Georgia will be spending only around $3.15 per day per patient .
But in so many other areas we still are dragging .
The recent history of the Dominican Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive .
The jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure .
Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people , who deserve to breathe without fear .
In presenting plans for such express buses before the Montgomery County Council , the administrator of the NCTA , C. Darwin Stolzenbach , was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching .
Such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the NCTA are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area .
Must Berlin remain divided ? ?
The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler .
They insisted on the `` fundamental fact '' that `` the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status '' .
A horizon even and seamless , binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth .
That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood .
American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to approve .

Mayor Robert F. Wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office .
Little war , big test
At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position .
The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of 1954 , and last year Washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma .
He was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any .
Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word .
Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction .
He spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes .
He was , of course , in the House for a very long time .
To be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition .
Mr. Truman has only to recall the `` hopeless '' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr. Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr. Sam been there .
He was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist .
Under any name -- Mr. Speaker , Mr. Democrat , Mr. Sam -- he was a good man .
Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga .
The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa .
Further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned .
The Congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence .
It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism .
But if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach .
But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in St. Louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there .
The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev .
The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month .
A shock wave from Africa
Word of Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe .
He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe , the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody .
The next step awaits approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port Authority .
Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 .
If the party of Adenauer and Erhart , with 45 per cent of the vote , approaches the party of Willy Brandt , which won 36 per cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve .
Does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations ? ?
Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars , Communism , depression , and other troubles of the world ? ?
Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns ? ?
Without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily .
Mr. Balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring .
Within the Organization of American States , there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously .

Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state .
But Interior Secretary Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves .
The move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod , from Provincetown to Chatham , is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest in that area .
But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern , for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country .
The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year .
But that heritage is shrinking even faster .

The Carbondale Industrial Development Corp. has obtained a $500,000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs .
St. Louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests .

Moreover , Col. Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be useful in `` screening '' Castro agents ; ;
Also under consideration is an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New York .
The decline of the Cunard line from its position of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation .
Gen. Maxwell Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is `` very much encouraged '' about the chances of the pro-Western government of Viet Nam turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to bolster the Vietnamese Army .
South Viet Nam has received $1,450,000,000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's visit last May .
Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U.N.'s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as `` the gravest crisis the institution has faced '' .
He should be , as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world .
What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's death to turn the entire U.N. staff from the Secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come .
The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them .
If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions the nature of the organization will have changed .
If they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the U. N. will not of necessity change .
Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor .
The board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions .
Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and Council , and a two-thirds vote .
The Controller retains his essential `` fiscal watchdog '' functions ; ;
He loses now-misplaced tax collection duties , which go to the Finance Department .
On net balance , in spite of Controller Gerosa's opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office , the Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now .
The capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises ; ;

and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution .
Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances .
Whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated .
His new book , entitled `` Slums And Suburbs '' , calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster .

`` Is it so the cannery is going to close '' ? ?
He did say he was out of cans , the No. 3's , but `` I requisitioned 22,000 '' .

It is a `` stair-step '' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade .
The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston .
It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents .
So successful has been this program , worked out by white and Negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months .
Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis .
It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South .
They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots .
All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it .
One of the most important is economic .
They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order .
At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company , I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype .
And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher .
`` Now , if I can just figure out what he's talking about , I'll use it '' .
Some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs .
It should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so far it hasn't worked that way .
You'd never guess it from the way they've played so far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 .
Robby could be better
There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year .
He'll still be a top player , they concede , because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him .
I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch .
Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season .
`` From Triandos , Brandt and Walker '' , answers Richards .
He jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury hasn't bothered him .
He's hitting the ball hard , in the batting cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year .
He was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field .
He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people .
) Did his mother make him this way ? ?
We believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn .
But we don't think she creates them .
We don't think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic .
Since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments .
`` You don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them .
But I do and my psychiatrist does , too .
When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board .
He pushes and straightens himself as if he can't stand the feeling of being held .
Physical contact is uncomfortable for him '' ! !

Carvey believes that reapportionment , which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase CDC membership .
In all probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress , and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites .
Naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council .
President Kennedy's latest warning to the Communist world that the United States will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was , somewhat surprisingly , reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron Curtain .

Some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the English language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar .
For the most part , however , the new version is contemporary and , as such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of Christ .

The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders .
The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt , Goldwater , Bridges , Dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s .
The most articulate Republicans are those who , in their desire to get back at Mr. Kennedy , already have created the image of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care .

First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested .
What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development .

However , the East Providence Rescue Squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation .
Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page .
There is one other point we should never lose sight of : Many veterans who enter VA hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected .
Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long .
There's a reason for this length of stay .
If the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient .
As a result , it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient .
The public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a VA hospital , the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other .
yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate .
This we can sympathetically understand .
Why should Congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection ? ?

As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly , from three to four hours a day .
It has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing .

However , he states unequivocally `` the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor '' .
Further , it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the Landrum-Griffin Act .
Some time ago , however , Mr. Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made , the Soviet Union would make them .
He seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock .
Khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb ? ?
So be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety , and neutron bombs , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing .

As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race .
Shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions ; ;
But the PHS conceded that the new radioactive particles `` will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United States '' .
Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility .
A recent study on radiation exposure by the AEC's division of biology and medicine stated : `` The question of the biological effect of ( radiation ) doses is not considered '' herein .
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself .
When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices .
This third choice was in fact made .
Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder .
The second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere .
We take the position , however , that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us .
It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable .
Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice ; ;
one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience .
Speaking recently in Miami , Governor Rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests '' .
Taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argued that the responsibility of the United States is `` to do , confidently and firmly , not what is popular , but what is right '' .
The possibility , as he asserted , that the Russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless , of course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand .
What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations .
Ecumenical hopes
when his Holiness Pope John 23 , first called for an Ecumenical Council , and at the same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity , the enthusiasm among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate .
First of all , it is now known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity .
A major aim of the Council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity .
Can any Christian fail to respond to these words ? ?
Furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring .
It was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's positions and better comprehension of one's own .
One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts : knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest `` tactical '' atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend Berlin , for example ; ;

It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist depersonalization .
The soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed : but will their discontent spread to the officer class ? ?
Leninism-Marxism , as understood by Exegete Mao .
But the disposition to rebel is most definitely there .
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal .
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security .
China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions .

Key to the puzzles
the unoriginals
he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists .
Of straight dramas , there are All The Way Home , which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel , A Death In The Family ; ;
The only original works attempting to reach any stature : Tennessee Williams' disappointing domestic comedy , Period Of Adjustment , and Arthur Laurents' clever but empty Invitation To A March .
Among the musicals , Camelot came from T. H. White's The Once And Future King , and novels were the sources of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi .
And particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long been the rule , from Die Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma! and My Fair Lady .
Off-Broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original .
The belly boites , with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted Ionic columns , heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families .

Each dancer follows the ancient Oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates , and , through breathing and muscle control , she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room .

When a dancer does well , she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers' costumes .

But a great many of the dancers are more or less native .

When he was 15 , his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna .
The unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay : his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it was too much even for morbid-minded Vienna .
The children he painted were almost always in rags , his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness , and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic .
It contained , for example , a number of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays ; ;
Molotov , in particular , is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services , to increase rents and fares ; ;
But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party '' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism '' and , last but not least , on foreign policy .
There are other symptoms .
The fact that China ( which is obsessed by Formosa -- to Khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by North Korea and North Vietnam is highly indicative .
Eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare .

A brief for the negative
The pressure for our entry to the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely `` economic thoroughfare '' , or garden path , with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background .
In entering this union we will be surrendering most , if not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the Atlantic Institute ( recently set up ) or the O.E.C.D. , I.M.F. and others .
If we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it ; ;
In my own case , I submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking .
Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- I cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every American city and asking myself if our society has gone mad .

There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary .

However well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business , which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style .
As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia '' .

Since the hero , a sterling and upright fellow , is a rich Brown senior , while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists , I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on `` Where The Boys Are '' , but I shall do nothing of the sort .
Instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- I hasten to report that it's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort Lauderdale , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say , sex .
If most of them weren't exactly specific -- well , that's the way it is in life , I guess .
`` Where The Boys Are '' also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy .
I was delighted with Paula Prentiss' comedy performance , which was as fresh and unstilted as one's highest hopes might ask .

Certainly not the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet .
They applauded every number , not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord .
Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen .
Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing .
But it didn't take Judy Garland , showman , long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have to learn to live with it .
But what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's arrangement of `` Django's Castle '' .
For subtle swinging rhythms , I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of `` Weep '' , and the fireworks went on display in `` 18 Carrots For Robert '' , a sax tribute to Johnny Hodges .
Unfortunately , Blakey doesn't choose to work much of the time in this vein .
What we did get , however , was impressive .
The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship , not only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns & Leon James , the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years , gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program .

He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over .
A very casual , pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach .

Mr. Nagrin has described four `` places '' , each with its scenery and people , added two `` diversions '' , and concluded with `` A Toccata for the Young '' , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing .
But we need not mind too much , because Mr. Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way .
The Symphony Of The Air , greatly assisted by Van Cliburn , last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start .
They showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York Philharmonic , the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony .
Today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it is understandable that a song , no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it .

If one of Mr. Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure , Mr. Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show .
Several of these double entries have been collected by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney , along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , Rodgers And Hart Revisited ( Spruce Records , 505 Fifth Avenue , New York ) .

With three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2 , -- `` The House I Live In '' , `` The Cranes Are Flying '' and `` Ballad Of A Soldier '' -- we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in `` The Day The War Ended '' .

`` Ring Of Bright Water '' by Gavin Maxwell is just that -- a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands .
`` He has married me with a ring of bright water '' , begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys .
Just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough .
He preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow .
With curiosity and elan , he explored every inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so .

So far as I know , the Comedie has never put Moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters .
perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into our own time .
A few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent .
Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago , Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns , while Fernand Ledoux , often performing at the Comedie , made them more gross than Moliere may have intended .
Accordingly , at the Comedie last year , Jean Meyer played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy .
Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor's wife .
Jouvet played him as a sincere zealot , and Ledoux , at the Comedie , made him a gross buffoon , or so the historians tell us .
In that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie .
And surely his Scapin has a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody's servant .

He assembled quantities of facts about the nature of American politics in general , as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest Presidential election in American history .
how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by Mr. White in `` The Making Of The President 1960 '' .
A lesson in politics
He frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's mouth , from numerous insiders and from Mr. Kennedy himself ; ;
but never from Mr. Nixon , who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust .
`` Rarely in American history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less '' , says Mr. White .
He wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them ; ;
Here are several :
To understand American politics is , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes , who are straw men , who controls , who does not .
`` All platforms are meaningless : the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it '' .

In a sense , he is offering Bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did -- the sound of the composer's mature style .

He might have been hoping , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the Ninth ; ;
The conductor's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth Piano Concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed , it did so with plenty of spring .
The concerto's soloist , Hans Richter-Haaser , played with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr Riefling .
But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science .

Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory of relativity .
First of all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding -- that is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds .
New galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies .
Dr. Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons .
Suppose , says Dr. Lyttleton , the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ) .
This would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess .
It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science .

Shakespeare had a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night's `` Much Ado About Nothing '' opening the season of free theatre in Central Park .
The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence .
A voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes .
More than half the audience departed .
Twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still raining , the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped .
The gallant company completed Act 4 , and got through part of Act 5 .
Eldon Elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood .
The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness .
There were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication .
All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; ;

This somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' , a collection of travel essays by William Sansom , who would never consider staying home for long .
The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell , Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an American multimillionaire ( his fourth ) .
There are sixteen essays in `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' .
Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another .
A contemplative connoisseur
It is an over-all impression Mr. Sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past .
But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions .
So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez ; ;

In one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza .
In recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio .
But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words .

It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity ; ;
For all practical purposes , the West stands disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership .
With this barrage , Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West .
`` America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike '' .
`` They are determined '' , Montgomery writes , `` not to be surprised again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary , but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible '' .

It is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer `` live '' for the first time only after he has died .

It is a kind of justice , too , that it should originate in London's Royal Albert Hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if not the greatest , performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( RCA Victor LM 2454 , $4.98 ) .
Not all the concern for health is well directed .
But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of U.S. scientists wants to supply them .
From his birch-paneled office in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene , under the university's football stadium in Minneapolis ( `` We get a rumble on every touchdown '' ) , blocky , grey-haired Dr. Keys directs an ambitious , $200,000-a-year experiment on diet , which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing .
Says Keys : `` Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think '' .
Morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him .
The simple mechanical strain of overweight , says New York's Dr. Norman Jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart `` for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built '' .
He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes .
Physiologically , people overeat because what Dr. Jolliffe calls the `` appestat '' is set too high .
Food for frustration .
Reports Dr. Keys : `` A fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more .
`` A remarkable substance '' , says Dr. Keys , `` quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries '' .
When thus deposited , Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks .
Explains Keys : As the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary artery .
The proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind .
Eventually , says Keys , one of two things happens .
Even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eaten in normal amounts , says Dr. Keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood .
That year , Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods .
Here Keys and others , such as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute , took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each .
Mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens .
Just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities .
Demons , fairies , angels , and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars .
The scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .
Although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever .
Aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .
As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .
It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery , moral disintegration , and destruction .
In our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play .
The concept of unity , in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force , in which good and evil are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas .
For this does not account for the integral , elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell .
The reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions to the contrary .
There is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit .
The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention .
If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .
On the contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world .
This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .
Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .
and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .
In any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us .
To say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .
What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .
They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .
Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .
The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a Catholic plot to kill King James 1 .
A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings .
She found this a marvel because , as she said , only six per cent of English people are churchgoers .
And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' .
Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy .
The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized .
Some Catholic priests lecture there ; ;
The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches .
The death of a man is unique , and yet it is universal .
Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur .
he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man's history .
His death is his alone , yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus .
for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence .
Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history .
and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being , possessing the image ( of God ) in his formation , but not receiving the similitude ( of God ) through the Spirit '' .
the similitude of God , by contrast , is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature .
but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth , whence his frame had been taken '' .
And even as she , having indeed a husband , Adam , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin , having become disobedient , was made the cause of death , both to herself and to the entire human race ; ;
That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too ; ;
for as it was Christ , the Word of God , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought death into the world , and all our woe .
Nevertheless , even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God , and he still rules .
Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; ;
Ezra Stiles Gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .
Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry '' to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a `` natural '' religion .
Had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi '' .
Happily for posterity , then , the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .
In the hall , after adjournment , Dr. Frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested Parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly Theodore again burst into tears .
Parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the Fellowship to throw him out .
But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .
Even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , Channing added -- remember , this is Channing , not Parker ! !
I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .
What otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters '' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' Holy , holy , holy is the Almighty Dollar ' `` ? ?
You and I do the same thing .
There are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome , but to the Almighty Dollar , a pope much nearer home .
We have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial Andrews Norton , by saying that , while he believed Jesus `` like other religious teachers '' , worked miracles , `` I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine '' .

Suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ? ?
Maybe we are talking about them too much .
Turning to the Word of God , we find the only sure way to do that .
In Psalm 27 : 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you , or to drive them out if they have you in their grip : `` The Lord is my light and my salvation ; ;
Read the next two verses : `` When the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .
He has already devoured huge areas of the world , putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire , reducing them to slavery , systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls , and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison .
she was fatally injured .
These things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door .
And nobody knows what comes next .
We live in the bright daylight of that great event ; ;
The apostle Paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the New Testament : `` He that spared not His own Son , but delivered Him up for us all , how shall He not with Him freely give us all things ? ?
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? ?
This gets down to the heart of our problem , for it reconciles us with God , whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against Him .
and then , with this God on our side , we can face the whole world without fear .
But this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .
Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later ; ;
But , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the Han period .
The importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it .
Furthermore , the middle number of the Lo Shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ; ;
Thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .
Although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the Lo Shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders .
but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing something about the world view of the Old Chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it .
The Yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the Sun ; ;
and whenever the Lo Shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion .
A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship .
This is the answer to the problem of `` membership delinquency '' .
If possible , he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present .
It is definitely a `` spiritual guidance conference '' .
Each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer .
Some churches require more .
Many churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes .
Others meet on Sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights .
-- The Local Church and Its Program
Use audio-visual aids .
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly .
Urge them to write out their questions for the box .
5 )
Use a textbook with assigned readings each week .

George E. Sweazey writes : `` There is danger in trying to make admission to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened '' .
Those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed .
The preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another .
It provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations .
Invite sponsors or Fellowship Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service .
Introduce each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation .
Lead the congregation in a response of welcome .
7 )
Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests .
The members of the `` family '' are drawn together by a common love for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom .
Every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .
Yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship .
This problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship .
The local `` family of God '' has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare .
Those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest .
-- Social and recreational activities
The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly to mind : `` Oh how we hate one another for the love of God '' ! !
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches .
Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .
To propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools .
Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .
To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .

While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable .
The specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-Asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century .
Africans and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .
But the problem extends elsewhere .
Again , India has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against Christians once the influence making for tolerance due to Nehru and his followers is gone .
He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them .
Theocracy reconsidered .
And while the nation was formerly named `` The Islamic Republic of Pakistan '' , it is now simply `` The Republic of Pakistan '' .

Of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows .
He is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both ; ;
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences .
He does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not `` permit '' in the sense explained .
`` the worst , and least probable '' result ; ;
But I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced '' ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?
) `` Quoting Mr. Kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he ( Toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' .
Let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be '' .
Mr. Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four , if he believed Communism was not only evil but `` also irredeemably evil '' , then he might `` think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world .
No political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature .
`` I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation '' .
It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .
Hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop '' .
We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not what future .
For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans .
How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?
What social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ?
They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate `` professionals '' but agitators for some kind of `` cause '' or `` reform '' , and this was no longer to be a `` pro '' .
Obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional '' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work .
This narrow `` professionalism '' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .
As our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the `` client relationship '' as an interpretation of their `` way of operating '' became evident .
and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro '' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .
Like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make .
Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in .
Realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for example , in Connecticut's new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like `` to have to obey '' , but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record .
But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , American good .
( 3 ) Over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .
Most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as `` professional people '' with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions .
If we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion .
Atomic energy
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20,000 tons of Aj .
Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world .
We know that we have hydrogen in water ; ;
For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days .
An octillion atoms
a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; ;
Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas ; ;
You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; ;
Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; ;
Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill .
If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper .
Music of the spheres
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; ;
And to see the meaning of this new picture , imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today .
Upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation .
To generalize for the entire nation would be absurd .
Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts .
We will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards , and through leaders in the government .
Some were clearly of Christian origin , among them the Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian liberty , Christian equality , and Christian fraternity the passion of the land .
Here , too , must be placed Unitarianism and , less obviously from Christian inspiration , Emerson , Transcendentalism , and the idealism of Walt Whitman .
A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills .
We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills .
A few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose .
For example , in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .
After 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant background of the older stock .
It was he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject .
As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men .
The royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world .
Basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns .
The Taoists were Quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity -- the Tao -- underlying all phenomena .
Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power .
Actually , Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism .
The Ch'an ( Zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana , but its psychology was pure early Taoist .
So , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit : the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .
Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience .
But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the Westerner mistakes it .
And this is only natural -- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest `` wonder drug '' .
A second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess : `` On one occasion Yang Shan ( Kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air .
Pope Pius the Sixth , at Rome , in April , 1778 , wrote the following : `` The faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures : For these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times '' .
Do not wonder that I said to thee , `` You must be born again '' .
Hebrews 14 .
Ephesians 2 : 1 .
And if our gospel also is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing .
Whoever is born of God does not commit sin ( That is , he does not practice sin .
1 St. John 4 : 7 .
If we are born of God we love the brethren .
2 Corinthians 17 .
For by grace you have been saved through faith ; ;
Colossians 27 .
So is everyone who is born of the Spirit .
Amen , amen , I say to you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has life everlasting , and does not come to judgment , but has passed from death to life .
the new birth is a work of god .
But to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of God ; ;
St. John 12 , 13 .
A final word
Our blessed Lord Jesus Christ , the sinless Son of God , who could not lie , said , `` Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God '' ( St. John 3 : 3 ) .
You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present .
It is permitted .
On the other hand , you may seek His favor , humble yourself before Him and beg His mercy , implore His forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to Him .
the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline .
I cannot define it fully .
They borrowed a typewriter , raised about $2,000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called Guideposts .

Already the city was filled with Barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty Revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the Prado .
My own earliest memories are of exiles : my three brothers and I were taken often to the United States `` to visit relatives '' while my father stayed on to fight the dictator Machado .
I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana .

he just can't do anything about it at all ! !
This gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and Aj .
Rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe of true Herculean build .
But contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel -- is something quite different .
Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! !
When the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands .

The most beautiful bed of pansies I've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day .
He seemed puzzled by my question .
but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down '' .
It isn't easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil .
Pansies don't have to be coddled ; ;
they'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days .
When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it's time to set them out where they are to remain .
That encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers .
I spade lots of compost into their bed ; ;
As a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used .
They need mulch .
I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame .
( An unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one .
That cold frame was my morale builder ; ;
Like strawberries in December , pansies are far more exciting in February than in May .
Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it .
The day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy '' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms .
Go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist .
A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special .
Naturally dormant and no spray danger
This cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored .
There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed .
It is thick , much like an egg plant's skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer .
Nutritious and a cholesterol reducer
Dr. Wilson C. Grant , of the Veterans' Administration Hospital , Coral Gables , Florida , and the University of Miami School of Medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients .
It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent's cities and people .
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ; ;
Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately .
Why , then , aren't we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? ?
Is there any other way to do the job ? ?
This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile .
Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( VTOL ) long-range military aircraft .
What targets have we successfully knocked out ? ?
These crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance .
It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance .
It could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night .
If we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening .
And although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications .
The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet .
The assisting musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing .
The Glazer-Fine Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization .
The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet ( RCA Victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing .
Here is truly a `` Great Recording of the Century '' , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect .
Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects .
The engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness .
A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained .
Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song .
Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score .
No sooner had Betsey come out of the ring than Mrs. Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch. Cadet or Noranda , another home-bred product , and won ! !
Speaking from long years of experience , Mrs. Long advised the Juniors : `` When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , stop ! !
Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right '' .
He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should take a more active part in encouraging the Junior Division ! !
Before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs .
This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class .
As the Juniors entered the ring , Mr. Spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the Finals of the Junior Competition .
Susan Hackmann , age 14 , from Baltimore , Md. , showing a Dachshund , was 3rd .
Percy Roberts , a leading judge will not be at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March .
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance .
Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog .
The Airedale Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any Show .
The Rio Grande KC is also considering having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify with points for Westminster .
Many a motel owner -- when we've stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children .
About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960 .
Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all over the country .
You may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal .
The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production .
It was much the same with pleasure boating at first .
If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways .
Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling .
Yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services .
It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards .
The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement .
If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time .
In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called `` dogs '' .
These slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them .
Such locks are nearly always used where the switch points `` face '' oncoming traffic .
Cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a Af bar .
Tap the `` A '' pieces 2-56 .
Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12'' '' and the first two 3-3/4'' '' bars ( `` A '' and `` B '' pieces ) , which are soldered together .
Drill a No. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw .
( See Fig. 7 .
Drill a No. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in Figs. 7 and 8 .
However , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back .
Bar `` C '' is 2-3/4'' '' long .
This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 .
Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 .
We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about
All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis .
Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn .
Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor .
Hot rodding is a science .
When more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct .
When it is needed , one formula is as important as another .
The constant is , which is one-quarter of 3.1416 , another constant known as `` pi '' .
The formula is : Af .
Dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches .
One inch equals 2.54 centimeters : one cubic inch equals 16.38 cubic centimeters .
For example , let's consider a standard 283 cubic inch Chevy Aj .
Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : Af .
This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension .
The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity .
Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc. ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches .
The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch .
Another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position .
Compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth .
The formula for this step is : Af .
The compression ratio is 10 to 1 .
This method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads .
, for Rear axle gear ratio
Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly .
When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula .

-- The best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner ( Mainliner-Highland Ellen ) , a member of the Dick Williams stable , who was clocked 2:25 .
Stardel ( Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover ) , 2:34 , looks quite promising .
Fury and Caper worked in 2:35 and did it with ease .
This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot .
His best mile to date is 2:32.2 .
Gamecock ( Tar Heel-Terka Hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2:32.2 .
This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center .
Step Aside ( Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow ) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows promise .

You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most ; ;
Here they are , with my comments and judgments .
The new , jacketed slug in Magnum corrected this .
But even without jacketed bullets , I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year .
He moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling .
This is a varmint load , pure and simple ; ;
Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles .
They have fine FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood .
Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions , regardless of caliber .

There's another addition to the Stevens line , the pump-action Model 77 in ( under $75 ) , which you may or may not consider a kid's gun ; ;
Although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market .
For example , a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under , the Broadway ( from $350 up , depending on grade ) , differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting .

For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets .
Founded in the Ninth Century B.C. it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas , ruler of the Megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself .
Start of tour
Most of the sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern hotels .
Erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous St. Sophias , the first of which was begun by Constantine , this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later .
On his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem .
Nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire , where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned .
On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing .
Directly opposite is the emperor's door , through which they entered the building .
Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome , now a park .
Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of Crusaders .
The round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer .
It stands in the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine , who brought it from Rome .
I stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , Bayezit , with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it .
I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately .
Outside I walked past the entrance to St. Sophia , turned left at the end of it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead .
Following arrowed signs , I veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world's greatest collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services .
Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat .
If necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time .
For roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone .
When you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen .
( This goes for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins .
The simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef .
Do use paper napkins ; ;
Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat , salami , Vienna sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , Bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties .
-- Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns .
Bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd .
-- An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic .
Broil or toast as usual .

Note :
Glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions .
they must be free of oil , wax and dust .
Check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay .
gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold .
If clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers .
Rectangular tiles

Decorated on unfired glaze with one coat of one-stroke ceramic colors ; ;
raised details of designs were colored in shades of yellow-green , blue-green , brown and pink .
Tiles were fired once to cone 05 .
Paperweight
Mold was used as pattern and clay cut by holding knife at about 45-degree angle , to form an undercut , making base smaller than the pattern top .
Fill small hole in bowl with clay .
Measurements for rectangular pattern piece A are obtained by measuring inside circumference and depth of butter mold bowl .
pattern D for lid fits over top diameter of Aj .
Pattern for inner lid piece E fits inside Aj .
Place patterns on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position .

Hold edges together , right side up .
Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat .
All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , No. 12 nails .
The jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete .
The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member .
A number of C clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets .
Placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens .
With the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling .
The chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending .
The aluminum , flush against the battens , acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily .
Plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , No. 12 Stronghold nails at all battens , the stem and the transom .
Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area .
Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size .
When the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail .
Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring .
The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink .
For padding the seats and bunks , I used Ensolite , Type Aj .
Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools .
The theory
Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or L-P gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) .
Some general things to look for in a site , if you haven't already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation .
we will take up alternative foundations later on .
The wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard Af and Af of a good grade , free from structural faults .
They should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected .
The outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer .
All panel board comes in standard Af foot size .
The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade .
The drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed .
Presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill .
See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds .
The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate .
All will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts .
Another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side .
The depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth .
`` Whereas , a Bridge over Merrimack River , from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf , Esquire , in Newbery , to Deer Island , and from said Island to Salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages , Teams and Travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all Times of Tide .
whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark .
Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the `` Massachusetts Magazine '' in May 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( Fig. 1 ) .
An advertisement in the `` Newburyport Herald '' , December 21 , 1810 , shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges .
The horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned .
In spite of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on July 17 , 1827 .
This second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway .
Union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams .
But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when Brigadier General William E. ( Grumble ) Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May , 1863 .
It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years .
So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience .
And a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement .
We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks .
And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities .
We also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille .
Safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together .
In many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet .
Do not forget this possibility .
If your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris .
Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense .
You may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in .
Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress .
New simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 .
On the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills .
The filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever .
When you're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter .
You'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves .
That brings its per-year cost down mighty low .
No matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , Colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed .
The units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area .
From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement .
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed .
Be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating .
These systems are more expensive than year-'round forced air systems .
If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system .
As you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors .
If you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity .
The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself .
An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period .
In insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 .
Good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you're doing your own contracting , don't award the job on the basis of price alone .
However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation .
A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water .
Is this site available ? ?
Quality is vitally important .
Some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests .
A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .
An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach .
Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .
The site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life .
The historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered .
A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide .
An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up .
The extent and location of open areas is noted .
Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant .
A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas ; ;
a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; ;
Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon .
I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? ?
The answer is , `` Yes '' ! !
Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World -- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America -- the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso -- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art -- the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms .
Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing .
Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism -- producing music for the masses .
It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges .
This masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous .
His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable .
His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .
Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances .
His fellow-countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not .
When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shaped his talents to his purpose .
Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas .
Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction .
Of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; ;

instructive -- maybe ; ;
First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately Af inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns .
If a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch .
If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result .
Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .
When this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image .
However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described .
Trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting .
I work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain .
I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an English make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight .
The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist .
True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory .

The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics .
) In most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him .
The American is very lucky if he has three .
If a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools .
Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .
And what has dancing to do with all this ? ?
Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus .
This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) .
The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw .
It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side .
Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home .
After this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher .
Push-ups
Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back .
Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper .
The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results .
When the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis ; ;
And dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more .
Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics .
The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality .

Ultraviolet microscopy
Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute .
The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz .
Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color .
The medical title of `` Lobar Ventilation In Man '' by Drs. C. J. Martin and A. C. Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process .
Heart-measuring techniques
A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed .
thus it takes about 16 Msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue .
It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream .
It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself .
Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers .
One of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions .
Sonar in medical research
A good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr. G. Baum who has explored the human eye .
The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter .
The mayor of the town taught them English and French .

Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ?
more private label competition .
As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .
If you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? ?
If private brand competition hasn't been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? ?
As markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger .

shortage of skilled salesmen .
Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? ?
`` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going to be harder to apply .
Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? ?
Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management .
This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer's training .
The interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance .
Consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work .
Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership .
In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools .
When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .
The necessity of that day has long disappeared .
It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand .
The local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications .
Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable .
The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account .
The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree .
One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute .
Have you set specific objectives for your employee publication ? ?
Are you using the most economical printing methods , paper , etc. .
Can you consider restricting any additional employee benefits to those paid for by profit-sharing money , such as was done in the union contract recently signed by American Motors Corporation ? ?
Do you try to maintain the principle of employee-contributed ( as opposed to fully company-paid ) programs ? ?
Have you investigated the possibility of moving midweek holidays forward to Monday or back to Friday in order to have an uninterrupted work week ? ?
What are the possibilities for operating your cafeteria for a single shift only and relying upon vending machines or prepackaged sandwiches for the second- and third-shift operations ? ?
Are there possibilities of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or other jobs ? ?
Do employees contribute their share of money to recreational facilities ? ?
Would a camera club be useful in taking pictures pertinent to plant safety ? ?
Are you spending too much money on team uniforms that benefit only a few employees ? ?
Are you utilizing vending machine proceeds to help pay for your program ? ?
Will your local bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant ? ?
Paid vacations
Will your union accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees ? ?
Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment ? ?
Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected health problems and avoid treating the latter ? ?
Are you in a rural or urban area ? ?
Encourage them to exercise their benefits .
Hallmark Cards , Inc. , Kansas City , Mo. , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` Benefit Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees .
M & R Dietetic Laboratories , Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe .
Generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement .
Otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers .
There are two sides of a coin for this decision .
Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .
These include : leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs .
Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias .
And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates .
Considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .
Joseph Horne , Pittsburgh .
Other THC activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources .
The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .
Since SAAMI's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults .
We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's famed Outer Banks .
There were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , Pop tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps .
Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .
No one knows where it will stop .
Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more .
They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends .
What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ?
The $9.50 for lodging they save .
It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts of home .
Yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title .
This leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people '' .
Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers .
First : what title , what setup ? ?
It is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions .
As examples at GE : Glen B. Warren , formerly manager of the Turbine Division , widely recognized as a turbine designer .
Consulting Engineer ,
Consulting Electrical Engineer ,
Many companies have systems , particularly in R & D , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations .
Several other examples : central and satellite
We have set up a central R & D department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants .
Part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management .
These headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- Engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design ; ;
These men are considered managers of engineers .
I suppose it is because we are just not big enough .
The only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been honored by ASME , AIEE or AIChE .
I am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability '' .
Staff engineer dept. manager
and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work .
These include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers .
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular .
Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family .
Common complaints included `` Mrs. Murphy '' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` Aunt Minnie '' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .
A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights .
There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed by a lawyer .
How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan ? ?
The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies .
For example , the officials of Poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem .
It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods , and that's an understatement .
But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights .
Only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th ; ;
others were building .
The oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development .
A primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark .
It pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .
If you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` Dowguard '' be sure to check it .
Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .
Spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in .
Are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?
This applies to repair work of winter storage .
Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .
And it's far from the end for plastics .
According to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit .
Shipping cost is also reduced ; ;
Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding .
What plastics to use ? ?
Its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to Du Pont .
Thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign .
For specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc. , reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used .
A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) .
Trans-illuminated billboards
Also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign .
Spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another ; ;
Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied .
Signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way .
they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces .
Changeable letters fill many needs
For example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in. and six 36-in. red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background .
Stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains .
For mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels .
It's a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place .
There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished Af closet .
And trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out .
New rule no. 3 : rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you
This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because : 1 .
It makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 .
It changes the answers on when to do what at the site .
For example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first .
Says Clarence Thompson : `` We dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself '' .
only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads ; ;
1 .
Of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost .
6 .
More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf .
For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper .
Reports Jim Lendrum : `` By studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three .
And you don't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the Middle Ages .
International Touring Documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data .
Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group .
The actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car .
If you drive greater distances than that , you'll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment , fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands .
Conclusions : The people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental .
but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo .
but communication , no .
Smith's first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good deal more than bread alone .
Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style : Af Note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ; ;
Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs from expected norms .
He may then very well conclude that `` everybody '' is probably not the true target of her resentment .
The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; ;
Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; ;
almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .
What he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved .
Stammering or repetition of I , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty .
She was the John Harvey , one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force , to Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943 .
I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies '' .
It would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below .
Secrecy was paramount .
True , there had been raids on Naples -- but Naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast .
`` This harbor is a bomber's paradise '' , the Britisher had said with frank grimness .
Vesole had been stunned .
Like hell ! !
They seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as Bari .
The other half of the crew , plus Beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard .
Then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward .
But how could -- ? ?

Merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss .
Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors .
Luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt .
Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .
When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream , we have an instance of deja vue , except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar .
The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself .
Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy , clairvoyance , prevision and retrovision .
Every dream , and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought , is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available .
But these are dreamed in original action , in some particular continuity which we don't remember having seen in real life .
As in the theory of perception , established in psycho-physiology , the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain .
The body , senses and brain , in common with all matter , have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies .
Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions .
As a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .
Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream .
Nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances of deja vue , in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before , a feeling which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists .
These contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight .
In a climate hostile to agriculture , Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques .
Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells .
`` Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push '' .
Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread .
Mr. Clark's studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour .
When they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal .
Salads are served at least once a day .
Vegetables are served liberally .
Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , `` Lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today '' ? ?
Milk appears twice a day .
Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served .
Also , salt water fish is on the table once a week .
Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm .
Wheat-germ , brewer's yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce , meat loaves .
Nothing is peeled .
They learn to like these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time .
They tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey .
Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds .
Homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins .
Even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , Mr. Clark felt the school had a good health program .
A vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking .
Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit .
`` Good old iron compass '' ! !
Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail .
Public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map .
Between the unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat , arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory .
Each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River .
Always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them .
Sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog , but 85% of his trips were completed .
Plane radios were not yet available , and once in the air , Fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation .
There he'd take a compass reading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him .
Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country .
At a nod of his head they let go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream .
How did I get to be sixty-five so fast ? ?
Still , it seems in the far future .
Sixty-five years and you've had it ! !
Oh sure ! !
never seemed as if it could happen to you ; ;
Here it is ! !
If so , you are of the old school .
Everything must balance to the last penny .
To put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded .
This is followed by a boom in conferences .
Yes sir ! !
Conferences become very popular .
When a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on .
I , frankly , can't draw a straight line .
You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it .
Anyway , I'll bet you have a lot of fun .
Do you like to sew ? ?
Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ?
There is always a market for this line of work .
They love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from place to place , take down the curtains , put up new ones and have themselves a real ball .
Perhaps you would like to become a writer .
This gives you a wide and varied choice .
Just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep on plugging , and finally you will make the grade .
They are many and varied .
Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character .
An animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .
This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .
In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality .
The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941 .
In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more .
We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .
that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation .
Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage .
If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it .
In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .
and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times .
at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making .
The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire .
He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost .
It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves '' .
Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form .
In tradition and in poetry , the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony .
Beyond a certain point , of course , no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that .
Our society has `` emancipated '' the woman , giving her new independence and new authority .
More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor .
One wife , described by a New York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties .
Some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .
Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .
Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .
Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .
Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr. Maurice Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .
Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up .
On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .

In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him .
`` At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey .
During the course of the trial , Jelke backed up part of that statement .
She was Mary Lou Brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive .

Tewfik Badrawi , Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of Cairo society enjoyed her company .
It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio's , an excellent Italian restaurant .
It was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous `` Lady Harrington '' .
Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls .
There is only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream .
Continuing glibly in this vein , he paused to comfort her :
`` You have it , all right .
But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about .
When she said that she didn't have the money , he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one .
Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day .
Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone machines .
Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .
Sarah Gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and Mr. A. , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' .
In this sense , authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative .
After his pains got worse , Tom decided to see a real doctor , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung .
Yes , Tom caught it in time to stay alive .
The evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths of thousands .
Malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for .
A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion .
Second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row .
Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking -- but it's important to remember that there's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits .
Correction can save teeth
In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy .
If he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for Susie an appliance consisting of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs .
Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position .
Then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist .
Work that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 in New York City or Chicago .
`` Factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner '' , says Dr. Brodie .
Plaster of Paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child .
To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things :
As was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of this sort of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive .
One way to do this is by `` proxy sittings '' , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter .
If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions .
Here the absent sitter makes a `` date '' with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ) , asking him to `` come in '' at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him .
Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him .
An interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a `` hit '' , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances ? ?
It is , of course , easy to see how `` J '' will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another .
To get around this quite difficult corner , there is one first aid to objectiveness : prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him .
`` He had four children , two sets of twins .
Methods have been developed of assigning `` weights '' to statements ; ;
Does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ?
Now when , so to speak , the cream has been skimmed off , and the items in the successful categories separated out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated `` cream '' , where the sensitive is at her best .
Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view : `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door '' .
If asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she `` just gets them '' -- some more vividly than others .
But this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail ; ;
Farming is confining .
Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .
Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 .
You could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small .
Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract .
Labor
In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor , compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 .
Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities .
The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .
Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road .

Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .
Interruptions came largely from the bench , which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on , though it , too , made no serious effort to choke off the flow .
In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship ; ;
It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection , and of refining the recollection , that will last as long as there are Jews .
In regard to Eichmann , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook , which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism , a principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent .
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-Semite and the concentration-camp brute ? ?
The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to `` the germ of anti-Semitism '' among the Germans which Hitler `` stimulated and transformed '' .
Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis , both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states .
Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports ? ?
It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; ;
In New York City in 1958 , the city's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device .
It has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies .
The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation .
All too often our language is unduly harsh .
The grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ) , the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church , the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries , the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law .
This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements .
Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature , Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .
Many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful .
The so-called `` noble experiment '' came to an inglorious end .
This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian countries .
The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives .
To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment .
Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : The civil law is concerned with public crimes .
All told , they offered a highly confused picture .
But since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information .
Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .
The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years .
One by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .
Ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters .
On May 11 , she reached Iceland .
The great , crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason .
A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther .
Instead of quelling the dissension , as many captains of the era would have done ( Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's head off under similar circumstances ) , Hudson decided to be reasonable .
Up spoke carpenter Staffe , who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home .
All through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait , avoiding ice and rocky islands .
Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty .
Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship .
Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .
The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders .
This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk Ab1,040 .
Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food .
Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .
Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River .
While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly , from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate .
Still another , annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive , wrote : `` yore letter was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget '' .
She is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and Union from the muzzle to the crupper '' .
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home : `` what has become of Halda and Laura ? ?
Charles Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .
I eat too much eggs and poark .
In the South , after the first year of the war , paper and ink were very poor .
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia : `` dear Pa .
Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers .
2 ) As a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others , it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness .
One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years .
Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy .
2 ) The concept that an `` American national folklore '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend .
Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies , it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter .
On the one side we have the university professors and their students , trained in Teutonic methods of research , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups that make up this nation .
On the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western '' or colonial material willy-nilly .
Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .
The problems confuse even the experts .
Anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four .
and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .
Fundamentally , both these types , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material .
As a result , most people don't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; ;
Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ? ?
Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind in this connection , as does John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People , Yes .
But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion was being wooed by the opposition , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans .
To forestall any change of allegiance , the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion , as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay .
In fact , O'Connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin .
Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .
O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal .
On Election Day -- November 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men , bribers , and experts in forging repeat votes .
In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .
O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .
A second bullet ricocheted off Max's belt buckle , leaving him unhurt but in some distress .
To them bums ? ?
once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will .
its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast .
Tsunami are rare , however , in the Atlantic Ocean ; ;
one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay .
This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives .
In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high .
Ordinary water tides are disregarded .
Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami .
All of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system , and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .
But not a single human life was lost , and property damage in the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $800,000 .
The key to the world of geology is change ; ;
The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this .
Today's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated , but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them .
We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled .
These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core .
Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .
The restless earth and its interior
At twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday , April 18 , 1906 , San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake .
In Ireland's County Limerick , near the River Shannon , there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen , which means `` Garden of Owen '' .
The cry `` Garryowen '' ! !
Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern Army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables .
But don't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh , especially in a saloon on Saturday night .
Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer , he managed to get transferred to the combat forces .
In combat , helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed .
But in maneuvers , with the top brass watching him all the time , it's easy .
Instead Sergeant Early was quiet , sharp and confident .
That saved Mel Chandler .
It happened at the St. Patrick's Day party , a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march .
Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit , and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World War 2 .
At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12 , they were in doubt no longer .
The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men , armed with Russian machine guns , attacked the position held by Chandler's men .
Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .
Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight .
So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over , he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment .
I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions .
and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States .
These conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world Communism .
This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions ; ;
and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .
Proximate in the sense that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends we seek , to which victory over Communism is but a means .
The uses of power
I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .
the other , for the most part , true .
I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention .
I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts , and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might And Soviet Myth .
Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity .
U.S. `` prestige ''
and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .
This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest in itself ; ;
To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring .
There was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests .
The first rattle of the machine guns , at 7:10 in the evening , roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear .
Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons , I heard the thumping of mortars .
Gunfire saves the moon
This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane , fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9-11 , 1960 ) .
Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death .
`` Precisely '' , said Mr. Frans .
For so long as death was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral a feast .
Even if it did not , how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns ? ?
In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire .

In Keng Kok , the City of Silkworms , the Prime Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .

Together they had probably done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century -- constructively .
Mr. Keo , once a diplomat in Paris and Washington , was Commissioner of Rural Affairs .
John , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London School of Economics , headed the rural development division of USOM , the United States Operations Mission administering U.S. aid .
We have 2,500 such projects , and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools .
Ask Mr. Keo '' .
`` Where there was no road , they lived without one .
Then we hung overboard in the water .
Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song , on the cool Bolovens Plateau .
Strings keep souls in place
The preparations were elaborate : flowers , candles , incense sticks , rice wine , dozens of delicacies , and pieces of white cotton string .
A man has 32 souls , one for each part of the body .
With the divinities present and our souls in place , we were wished health , happiness , and power .
As we stepped out into the sunlight , a man came up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand .
It had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar .
`` I like to follow the holidays when they come along .
to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent ; ;
`` I want to show respect for my parents' religion '' was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism .
Still another suggested that he would join a temple `` for social reasons , since I'll be living in a suburb '' .
It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and , in addition , required kosher food .
Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl in town '' .
It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts .
The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .
The lower-middle class college student
What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that , although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts , they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish world .
Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban , lower-middle class Jewish student .
On the one hand , there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school .
For girls , the overprotection is far more pervasive .
The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field .
Then , with the new affluence , there is actually a sallying forth into the wide , wide world beyond the precincts of New York .
In general , however , the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith .
It is interesting that , although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate .
These announcements are , in effect , advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts .
Among the boys , there is very little bravado about drinking .
the burn oozed watery fluid for many days , and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts .
The results were good , but which treatment helped is still not known .
One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut , even when on a knuckle , if it was made by a rusty tool ; ;
she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth , over which she poured turpentine .
Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke .
Rabies were cured or prevented by `` madstones '' which the pioneer wore or carried .
Blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance .
this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part .
A handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water ; ;
Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies .
Chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves .
A German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice .
This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on .
Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep was considered poisonous ; ;
Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours , tie it on the wart , and wear it for a week .
One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps .
It may , on occasion , be anything but that .
These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking , for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis .
especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal , their importance mounts .
The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money .
Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served .
otherwise , the cork dries and air enters to spoil it .
consequently , one's wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces .
No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! !
But the fact remains that in most restaurants , including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon , the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered , and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal .
But white wines never ! !
A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea .
it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy .
Most of the wines of Beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young ; ;
An excellent crop was expected that year .
William , who lived in neighboring St. Mary's parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year .
The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless Negroes .
Gorham refused to accept money for slave property , but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the North involved ? ?
Henry hid his annoyance , although both he and William were furious with their Yankee brother .
If not , he was willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim .
Rose , a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential , was worth $400 .
Yet even if he could get the necessary approval , fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special permission .
News of the legislative veto appeared in the New Orleans papers , and Henry and William became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance .
During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists .
In New York , Lydia Maria Child welcomed him enthusiastically : `` I have lately heard of you from the Legislature of Louisiana , and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man '' .
She agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately .
Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial .
Should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier , Giffen was to provide passage at once .
Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844 .

Nonetheless , they found common interests .
The event was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time , hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the Administration .
Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form .
Hoping to cut down on such works , Udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized .
Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this .
A valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein and now hangs in the Blue Room .

While a Senator , Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the Belasco Theater , as well as the Dolley Madison and the Benjamin Taylor houses , all scheduled for razing .
Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square .
On delving deeper , Walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified as `` early nondescript '' .
The buildings are mostly Georgian .
But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence , and he must go far , even though he may go fast , for sophisticated pleasures .
President Dickey's golden retriever , frolicking in the snow at his feet , added to the picture of masculine informality .
She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head .
And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today .

The Dartmouth Skiway , at Holt's Ledge , ten miles north of the campus , has one of the best terrains in the East , ranging from novice to expert .
Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke , Dartmouth's own mountain .
The Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters , extending from the Vermont hills , just across the river from the college , through Hanover to the College Grant -- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country .
Their affection for their college home has even caused President Dickey to comment on this `` place loyalty '' as something rather specially Hanoverian .
Early in the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university .
It fixed on Dartmouth College , which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered .
It was a hardy undertaking , and Wheelock's was indeed `` a voice crying in the wilderness '' .
The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings .
The presidents of Cornell , Wisconsin , C.C.N.Y. , Bowdoin , Vermont , Brown , Columbia , Princeton , Yale , and Harvard and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there .
But it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England .
All three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred .
Students of the college who are candidates for the A.B. degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools , may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year , thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year .
It is still , however , the junior member of the League , if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do .
Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking .
Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular suspect .
He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day , information which must have come from Lizzie .
Fall River police did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men .
These officers found no incriminating information .
From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying , more than a mile away .
She said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs. Borden told her to wash the windows .
He knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone .
Mrs. Borden would not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand .
He could have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar .
His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree , with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding the side door , was odd .
And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing , a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed .
What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay ? ?
Neither had any interest in the deaths ; ;
indeed , it was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and Mrs. Borden alive .
The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration , but Lizzie's expression of her opinion , as reported in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet .
And , much as she detested Hiram Harrington , she also did not accuse him .
I have previously described how , during the week of the murder , Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes .
The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this .
With four younger children at home , Lucy stepped into her mother's role , and even after the brothers and sisters were grown , she was her father's comfort and stay until he died in 1879 .
She read Maitland's Dark Ages , `` which I enjoyed very much '' ; ;
She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone .
Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately '' .
And it was Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman College .
There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college .
They were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to Germany with her brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study .
and her close knowledge of individual students .
Both had eager and inquiring minds ; ;
When Dr. Wallace Buttrick , wise in his judgment of people , declined to have the Science Building named for him , he wrote Miss Tapley ( April 7 , 1923 ) `` If you had asked me , I think I would have suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton .
She urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission .
Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; ;
and ground had been broken for the superintendent's home .
But she decided to stay at Spelman .
She helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping .
She was closely associated with the Founders in all their trials and hardships .
Quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary .
She served as secretary in the Seminary office for 25 years , and was in charge of correspondence , records , and bookkeeping .
In a few school districts one finds a link between school and job .
In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money , there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other .
In general , however , it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school , the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next .
High motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work .
Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools .
And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership .
The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers .
I believe the situation is improving , but the success stories need to be heavily publicized .
Those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .
I have been using the word `` vocational '' as a layman would at first sight think it should be used .
To be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status .
It is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .
In the city , he said , the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can't get in .
In a far distant part of the United States , I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work .
In my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .
I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes .
In the United States , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil .
They are used mainly for their oil .
People depend less on seeds for foods in Australia , New Zealand , and Argentina , where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle , and the consumption of meat is high .
Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's cereal crop in 1957-1958 .
More than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock .
Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position .
These oils develop hard , smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances .
One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds .
Sizable amounts of soybean , coconut , and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps , detergents , and paint resins .
The discovery during the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the United States .
Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper .
It is used for making buttons and other small , hard objects of turnery .
Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry .
Single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family , such as cumin , dill , fennel , and angelica .
Sesame seed , which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt , Brazil , and Central America , has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds .
Beverages are made from seeds the world over .
Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree .
Several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts , the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America .
Cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised .
Seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain , baking , crushing oilseed , refining edible oil , brewing , distilling , and mixing feed .
Not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products .
That became their `` home range '' .
Such marchin' in wholesale numbers was called a `` drift '' , or `` winter drift '' , and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range .
This term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , `` He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm '' .
This word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle , but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot .
The cowboy called this breed of cattle `` magpies '' .
A `` cattaloe '' was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle .
The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a `` milk pitcher '' .
Cows givin' no milk were knowed as `` strippers '' .
The term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals .
When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin' '' .
They were said to be `` on their heads '' when grazin' .
The Injun's name for beef was `` wohaw '' , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun on the trails .
The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters .
It required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider .
The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up the trail `` Sonora reds '' , while they called all cattle drove up from Mexico `` yaks '' , because they came from the Yaqui Injun country , or gave 'em the name of `` Mexican buckskins '' .
The counters rode through the pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead .
This method of countin' was usually done at the request , and in the presence , of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd .
A `` book count '' was the sellin' of cattle by the books , commonly resorted to in the early days , sometimes much to the profit of the seller .
The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin .
Eventually herdin' the hosses was spoken of as `` hoss rustlin' '' , and the wrangler was called the `` hoss rustler '' .
He found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before , and he circled once , nose to the ground , hair shooting up along his back , as it did when he was after lion or bear , and then he lifted his head and bayed , and the pack joined in , all heads high , and Jones knew it was a hot trail .
Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him .
Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party .
`` Not yet '' , cautioned Ulyate .
A motley pack , chosen for effectiveness , not beauty .
She's just the other side of that bush '' ! !
And he hasn't even got a knife on him .
Of the thirty-four , seventeen had been killed by lions , and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses .
Her roar changed to a growl .
Although she appeared more subdued and defeated , Jones knew she was growing more dangerous .
Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched , and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet .
Jones yelled , `` or she'll kill 'em all .
For such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of their equipment .
Called out Means as she ran .
The dogs were tired .
At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the Reef .
She took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully , crouched at the base of a thorn tree , and waited for them to come up .
With the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land .
Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding , edging closer , watching for a chance to throw , but ready to spin and run , rope whining about his head , horse edging tensely under him , but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion .
Again she snarled , and again he edged .
She was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay , but -- and here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound .
Means held steady one jump ahead of her .
A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion , from a standing start .
Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point .
Progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference '' of the National Council or the World Council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors .
It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .
There is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building .
The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .
Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .
And this is what all too often happens .
Likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals .
Its people are agreeable friends .
A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired , `` Do you belong to this church , Mr. Rancher '' ? ?
As long as the congregation regards the church as `` our '' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my '' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance .
A local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church .
and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering all morning , until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap .
Every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink , they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision .
His face was always in the newspapers , sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life .
Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching Ruth , who was still called Jidge by all his friends , or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him ( Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world `` Kid '' .
One who , for a time , succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires , who called himself , in the newspapers , Art the Great , or The Great Shires .
( This made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager .
) The sorry fact about this young man , who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball , was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed , and always an irritant to his associates , but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public .
There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down ; ;
or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor , with or without a partner ; ;
But , as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over , `` not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me '' , so little Tommy ran all the way home .
Radio broadcasts , however -- now that even plain people could afford `` loud speakers '' on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones , chiefly women , who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition , became first inured , then attracted , then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park .
This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .
The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative , despite the baseball jargon , that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school .
This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal '' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .
Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future .
However , as Erickson has noted , the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence .
And , as shown in Chapter 6 , , some SNP females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence , through the aid of , and their identification with , alter-parents .
These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .
and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study .
Erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship '' .
The absence , during her childhood and early adolescence , of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression , both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting .
These things both express and , at the same time , continue contributing to , their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty .
The excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance , though through different facets of experience .
Sex was both .
Most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .
The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .
The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion , embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern , , and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior .
In the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .
In the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides .
An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive .
Chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity .
Parker , who agreed with much of this criticism , did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects .
In 1912 the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on February 1 , 1913 .
Under the new rules , testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character .
The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A.L.A.M. were more representative , for they never adopted a policy of exclusion .
Many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns .
The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A.L.A.M. patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology .
The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.L.A.M. pool .
He had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's .
Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents .
`` My personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making '' , he later told a Congressional committee .
The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association .
Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta .
On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments .
Turn left a block or so before the street ends , and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino .
You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal City .
Start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill .

The large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death ( if so , the statue once stood in the senate house ) .
Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes , as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling , can be seen Sundays ( 11:00 to 12:00 noon ) .
The dome of the church is , outside of St. Peter's , one of the largest in Rome .
Your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains , its two churches that almost face each other , and its russet-colored buildings , is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk .
Giovanni Bernini's `` Fountain of the Rivers '' , in the center of the piazza , is built around a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks , with four huge figures , one at each corner , denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the Danube , the Ganges , the Nile , and the Plate .
In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit , have a drink or lunch , and watch the fountains in the square .
Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale ; ;
The only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome .
( Along the way there , about one hundred yards on your right , you pass a simple restaurant , La Sacrestia , where you can have the best pizza in Rome .
A few yards farther , on the Via Dei Bergamaschi , is the Piazza Colonna .
The great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius .
He has never , himself , done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has ? ?
which is precisely what , and where , he is , and is the reason he walks in twos and threes .
He becomes more callous , the population becomes more hostile , the situation grows more tense , and the police force is increased .

the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep ; ;
Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury .
As far as the color problem is concerned , there is but one great difference between the Southern white and the Northerner : the Southerner remembers , historically and in his own psyche , a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and they loved him .
The resulting , indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis of the Southern hysteria .
Southerners see them all the time .
Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we , this nation , have become .
And I was curious about the African reaction .
Had I been there , I , too , in the eyes of most Americans , would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists .
As long as audiences came to see the movement , there seemed little reason to adventure further .
The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; ;
Thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke The Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures .
Narrative time and film time
Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen , at the rate , for silent movies , of 16 frames per second , and , for sound films , 24 frames per second .
In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .
The movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable .
The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film .
much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old West -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's .
The robbers run from the hide-out , take cover in a wooded declivity , and are shot dead by the posse .
As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience .
He did more than that .
The meaning of the word is quite physical , to begin with .
If , as a home movie maker , you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps , you have merely recorded an historical event .
If , in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends , you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event , you have begun to be an artist in film ; ;
you are employing the basic technique of film ; ;
you are cutting .
There still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art .
Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film .
Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .
Not surprisingly , this approach did not work .
But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies .
A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; ;
theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world .
( Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ; ;
once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going .
The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ) .
The inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; ;
The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; ;
the schism between central city and suburb , Negro and White , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis .
It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings .
Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century .
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .
Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company .
Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River .
Fort Toulouse , on the Alabama River , had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas and Choctaws , but money was available for only one other new post , near the present Nashville , Tennessee , and this was soon abandoned .
Their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the Alabama , the Tombigbee , the Tennessee , and Cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees .
one was British and the other , French .
Perier finally , in one last bid in 1730 , cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in France .
It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade .

As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions .
Masu's home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials .
Moreover , prudence alone would indicate that , unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed , the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs , leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company , or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as , for that matter , the Quakers , who once had many meetings in the pre-Civil War South , largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue , never to recover a large number of southern adherents ) .
It is true , of course , that the end or objective of this action was different .
Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives ; ;
These principles we have now set forth .
`` Billions of American dollars , not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of U.S. taxpayers '' , this author states , `` are being poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression , the persecution , and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white '' .
The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North .
The race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive .
Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .
I am naive , they say , to make use of such words .
Why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ? ?
If he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ? ?
'' This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement .
In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down .
Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .
But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .
There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .
I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking : don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves .
The fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold .
but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .
Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .
Speaking generally , it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the Western powers .
In what has aptly been called a `` constitutional revolution '' , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the `` night-watchman state '' ) to one with affirmative duties to perform .
The `` positive state '' came into existence .
A third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed : American immersion and involvement in world affairs .
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution .
Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution .
A measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists in 1959 .
For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit .
Today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world .
( Whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions .
it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis .
These fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power .
The short answer to those questions is `` yes '' .
What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ?
I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the `` commit buttons '' that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons .
They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .
Among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their `` hardware '' , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call `` scenarios '' .
They inhabit a secret world centered on `` go codes '' and `` gold phones '' .
Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more Russians and Communist Chinese , too -- thought about accidental war .

After that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released .
Unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done .
A white man would not have seen it .
The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos .
It is the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful .
Which does not mean that it is ugly .
Part of it is , of course .
They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand .
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly .
There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not .

And countless others like them have died .
Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died .

In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of London , started to decline .
It seems that for Persia , and especially for this city , there are only two times : the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present .

From the terraces -- eighteen in all -- broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river .
Below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river .
Above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance .
Here in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them : poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face .
In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums .
Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .
Here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided .
for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : `` They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains ; ;
Yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety : design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque .
When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , `` commuting '' between the two cities .
In his native Cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet .
When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale .
The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium .
No , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such .
At the outset of his career , Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year .
Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy : `` Rome is my second home .
With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ? ?
You might have failed .
The ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children .
All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .
It is well then that in this hour both of `` national peril '' and of `` national opportunity '' we can take counsel with the men who made the nation .
Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory .
His revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders .
Principal author of `` The Federalist '' , he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly .
His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions .
Washington castigated his critic , General Conway , as being capable of `` all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity '' .
The Frenchman was astonished .
Yet when , at war's end , the ex-Tory made the first move to resume correspondence , Jay wrote him from Paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement :
Save Jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal Constitution .
When , in 1832 , the South Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve , they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman .
As the New South snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more and more homogeneous with the North -- a tendency which Willard Thorp terms `` Yankeefication '' , as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte , Birmingham , and Houston .
As for progress , the `` backward South '' can boast of Baton Rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126,000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000 .
But these sources have not been tapped .
This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .
Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the buses ; ;
This bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the Southern way of existence .
Many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this `` gracious Old South '' imagery , creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell's `` Tara '' Plantation .
It bewilders and befuddles him .
Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .
From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit .
Thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition .
The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience .
The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order .
Some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth .
Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world .
The system works as an impersonal mechanism .
The sequence may involve a sharp contrast : for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap ; ;
Looking back , Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock .
Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion .
The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve .
Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their `` motional content '' .
But the metamorphosis must come first .
Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , Merce Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim .
He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect .
But I would never have thought of it myself '' .
A man and a girl happen to meet ; ;
Their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all .
The other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance .
Each performance may be different .
He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .
The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers .
This right of the State , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government .
In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede .
When the Know-nothings get control , it will read , All men are created equal except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics .
But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union , the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede .
Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution .
They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that `` all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
Here are the two Preambles : Federal Constitution , 1789
Much as he abhorred slavery , Lincoln was always willing to concede to each `` slave state '' the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it .
He understood that both sides were at fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural .
The 140,414 Americans who gave `` the last full measure of devotion '' to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people .
But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways .
There was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep Americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet .
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .
We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .
Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .
To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .
He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side .
We are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements .
The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .
What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ? ?
In fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .
But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .
My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris .
Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish .
own pride and humility .
For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another .
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .
I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously .
`` Yes .
How can we make sense of this division ? ?
`` Well , really there is none at all .
He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel .
The family was Protestant , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go .
At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie .
I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood .
At the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly .
If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; ;
but there is also compassion .
Harold Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting For Godot '' is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics , ethic , and common way of life '' .
Hemingway's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension .
Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .
For the beatnik , like the hipster , is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct .
it is Astarte , Ishtar , Venus , Yahwe , Dionysus , Christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe .
Jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse .
This is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat '' .
Thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to `` religious '' metaphors : they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion .
Righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats ; ;
If he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil .
That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; ;
Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge .
They are non-conformists on principle .
It is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed .
Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability .
If it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ? ?
This confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution : the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences .
Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex ; ;
In his chapter on `` The Loveways Of The Beat Generation '' , Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details .
How is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses .
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses ; ;
the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all .
Time in the sum is nothing .
but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time .
I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that I could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums beneath a window , with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ;
I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap , unfolded , and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals .
Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs ; ;
the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach ; ;
Pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite ; ;
seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch ; ;
Every morning early , in the summer , we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells , carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd , in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree , where no grass grew in the dense shade .
Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again , crushed beneath it .
A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter , the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees , and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves .
Sleepily , as if half-reluctant to break the silence , he lifted his voice : `` Rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today '' ! !
The lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee .
At four-o'clock , or four-thirty , the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ; ;
he tossed a paper toward every front door , and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing .
It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since .
he collapses , and dies .
The horrifying humor , the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong , the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby ; ;
The release , the freedom , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible ; ;
Again , the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood , with the figure of a child .
Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise , and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume , as with Cipolla ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann's stories .
As the first sentence suggests , both roads belong to death in the end .
Thus , on the highroad , a troop of soldiers `` marched in their own dust and sang '' , while on the footpath one man walks alone .
He is a widower , his three children are dead , he has no one left on earth ; ;
also he is a drunk , and has lost his job on that account .
Then an ambulance comes along , and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away .
He is `` a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard '' .
The `` reality '' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world .
The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery .
And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .
The mimetic imagination in the arts
The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts are `` modes of imitation '' , gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato .
But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent .
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons , however humble , in a divine drama .
Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense .
A word taken in its dictionary meaning , a photographic image of a recognizable object , the mere picturing of a `` scene '' tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings .
A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy .
In this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct .
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past .
Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am .
For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them .
The expression has become quite a cliche .

How do we define it '' ? ?
To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation '' .
A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell .
Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .
You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .
A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale ; ;
) , what voices would be left ? ?
Who is involved willy nilly ? ?
And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .
Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade .
The New England conscience became desensitized .
George W. Cable ( naturalized New Englander ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise Road , Northampton '' ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question '' .
New England , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation .
Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English .
Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .
In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .
Professor Fredrik Book , Sweden's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows : `` In this we have the verse of a painter ; ;
Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as `` Nameless And Immortal '' , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language .
He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .
The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .
To carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .
George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .
Each is still glorified as a national hero .
After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .
All his people ask for is no more war .
Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .
From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden .
Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men , and need not detain us here .
Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .
Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12 , it is unnecessary to speak .
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman .
Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist ; ;
His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom .
It was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became a detective in the first place .
These little problems help me to do so '' .
Why do the police find Holmes `` unorthodox '' ? ?
Linked to Holmes even in death , Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective , the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant .
Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; ;
In the American `` hardboiled '' detective story of the '20s and '30s , the spirit of the mad genius from Baker Street lives on .
Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation .
His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence .
moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .
But even when the police are honest , they do not trust the private eye .
In order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man .
The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer .
Great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network .
Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors .
The information is furnished by each of the guests , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves , and is received by the ears .
Since the air is a continuum , the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net .
The crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes .
We consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence .
In any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in Figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens .
Alexander the Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once .
In contrast to cocktail parties , military organizations , even in the field , are more formal .
This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action .
The connective system , or network , is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory , a college , or a rural village .
( B ) A message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times .
These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel .
Questions and , particularly , exclamations are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor .
He points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1 , , evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America .
It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .
The first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson .
The importance of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us , however .
And the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism , the ultimate exemplar .
During the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom bomb .
But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man , to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower's leadership .
It has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused .
For it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle began .
Though , to be sure , we gave Kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment .
This is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise .
But before I try to diagnose it , I would offer other evidence .
Adlai Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return .
Father Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception .
Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth .
We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ?
In his stead is a milquetoast version known as `` the corporation '' .
As a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing '' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .
Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop .
Persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside .
Also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees .
This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against .
Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force .
Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails , in direct violation of their constitutional rights .
They give strict interpretation to William James' statement that `` Every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself '' .
They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .
So all-important are ideas , we are told , that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others .
True , ideas are important , perhaps life's most precious treasures .
Have we not actually developed idea worship ? ?
here we find stored the wisdom of great minds .
What of his treatment of the Jew in The Merchant Of Venice ? ?
Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels .
Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people , his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories , Il Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries earlier .
It would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman .
This would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge .
False ideas surfeit another sector of our life .
That is questionable , to say the least .
Most assuredly ideas are invaluable .
Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate .
Man , we are told , is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad .
But have the results been heartening ? ?
Debate in the political arena can be productive of good .
It is testimony to the deep respect in which Mr. Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached .
It forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed .
It was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at prediction .
It recurred in the press conferences : the President's remarks about his running developed a singular tone , one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter .
Ironically enough , in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury .
`` My doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great '' .
He ascribes to the mercy of God the peace which this personal matter -- the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do -- has brought him .
About this man we had to think twice .
But the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major decisions , and thus for imposing his will on the people .
When the possibility that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision seemed to disconcert his questioners , Mr. Eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more .
Only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked .
The very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader .
and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual's command of language interacts with the other two .
For this change is not a change from one positive position to another , but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation .
Rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration .
An interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence .
There the community , faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice , can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced .
Relativism and equality are its characteristic diseases .
When disruptive change has penetrated to the third level of social order , the process of disruption rapidly reaches a point of no return .
Indeed , it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins .
The reasons for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change .
Civilization is what man has made of himself .
And when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence , any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence .
The process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual , while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs .
Weil identifies it as being `` rootless '' , Guardini as being `` placeless '' , Riesman as being `` lonely '' .
Its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces .
The problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there .
The basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational .
It is a total situation that is defended : the `` good old days '' .
The reactionary is confused about the existential status of a decaying tradition , but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy .
I am not making a clinical judgment here , for such personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst's consulting room , but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies than tragedy in life .
`` The Rocking Horse Winner '' is also a story about a boy's love for his mother .
I am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects .
There are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse .
The story ends in the child's illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to ride his horse to win for his mother .
The child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside .
But on one occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story .
The rocking , I realized , is the single element in the story that carries the erotic message , the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit .
We are also struck by the fact that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not offend , while the incestuous love of the man , Paul Morel , sometimes repels .
He would not have cared why it emerged , he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy .
Mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell .
Grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister , the twins Sibylla and Wiligis .
The infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him .
Grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle , delivers the city from its oppressors and marries Sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him .
and used gradations of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors .
At this period the thirty-year old Helion was ranked `` as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement '' , according to Herbert Read , `` and in the direct line of descent from Cezanne , Seurat , Gris and Leger '' .
but , he held , instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction '' , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the Raphaels and Poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and Mondrian .
Where would it all lead ? ?
Instead of this the 1930's witnessed a tragic economic depression , the rise of Fascist dictators in Europe , the wasting Civil War in Spain .
With those paintings of big constructions crashing down , he felt he could stop .
They were , in effect his last testament to non-objective art .
After a sort of death march during four days without food , Helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in East Germany .
A year later they were removed to a Stalag in the harbor of Stettin .
As Helion wrote afterward : ``
Finot held a wallet with my money and papers ; ;
The guards all rushed up to intervene ''
Riding trains , hitching hikes on trucks across Germany , slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of secret guides , he eventually reached Vichy France , and , by the winter of 1943 , was back in Virginia .
Now all his desires centered on `` rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence '' .
Before leaving for America , he happened to see his old friend Jean Arp and confided to him his new resolutions .
Everything in the way of representation has already been done by the old masters '' .
Helion , however , clung to the belief that `` in escaping from the Stalag I had also escaped from Abstraction '' .
He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at Oxford , Mississippi , thirty-five years ago .
That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books .
He has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed Southern .
It is more difficult with Faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge .
His denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the South or have written about the South .
His earliest work reflected heavy influences from English and continental writers .
His repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him .
The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated in the South and the Southwest in the three decades before the Civil War .
nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters .
But Thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions .
There may be a case of this sort , but it is not one we wish to argue , here .
Even if people do , in a not far distant future , begin to read one another's minds , there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind is especially worth reading -- worth more , that is , than what you can read in good books .
All we want from Dr. Huxley's statement is the feeling that this is an open world , in the view of the best scientific opinion , with practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next , and no important confinements with respect to what may be possible .
He is the stern guardian of the status quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age , and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed .
The thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological ardor .
There is another kind of ardor , a quiet , sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life , but no angry utopian contentions .
Mr. Lyford gives voice to a temper that represents , we think , an achieved plateau of reflective thinking .
Mr. Nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by our Department of State , and an American President observes sourly that Sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic '' .
We feel uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television set , but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us , we can hardly learn to control them .
Of one thing we can be sure : they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society '' .
No doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century .
On occasion it produces extraordinary novelties .
Thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall ; ;
Nor did a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights .
There were no reasons for such suppositions then .
This , conjoined with the considerations above , made the circular motions of heavenly bodies appear an almost directly observed fact .
By distinguishing superlunary ( celestial ) and sublunary ( terrestrial ) existence , and reinforcing this with the four-element physics of Empedocles , Aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies , which moved in only a perfect way , viz. in a perfect circle .
Circular motion , however , since it is eternal and perfectly continuous , lacks termini .
Only imcomplete , imperfect things move towards what they lack .
This is clear when one distinguishes the types of motion appropriate to both regions .
A projectile shot up from earth returns rectlinearly to its ' natural ' place of rest .
Their motion will be eternal and perfect .
Let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy .
This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .
It is the chief merit in Copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent .
Historical records indicate that Copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called ' revolution ' , unaware perhaps of its historical importance , he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction .
If in any one calculation Ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once , while Copernicus never required more than one third this number , then ( in the sense obvious to Margenau ) Ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than Copernican .
These could be met only by considering the dynamical elements of several planets at one time .
Analogously , anyone who argues that Einstein's theory of gravitation is simpler than Newton's , must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists , while the former can be managed ( with difficulty ) only by accomplished experts .
The Axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions .
The strongest appeal of the Copernican formulation consisted in just this : ideally , the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic ' rules ' of the theory .
Granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow .
What in The Almagest draws his fire ? ?
The critical , rigorous examinations of Nicholas of Cusa and Nicholas of Oresme provided the context ( a late medieval context ) for Nicholas Copernicus' own work .
Into the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama Henrietta , as every artist delights to do , wove strands of her own intuitive insights into human nature and -- especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters as this pair -- into the relations of men and women : `` In their relations , she was the giver and he the receiver , nay the demander .
She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man .
the moral powers no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .
And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature .
And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December .
By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that Papa and Mamma gave her a Life Of Dickens as a spur to her aspiration .
His father was a good friend of Rabbi Szold , and Joe lived with the Szolds for a while .
so Cyrus Adler became interested in her friend Racie Friedenwald , and Joe Jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe -- fell in love with pretty sister Rachel .
Young Morris , who , while attending the University of Pennsylvania , also taught and edited a paper , found time to write Henrietta twenty-page letters on everything that engaged his interest , from the acting of Sarah Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of `` Sulamith '' on the Jewish reform movement being promulgated by the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati .
and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College -- until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything .
`` we've got Father and Mother and each other '' said Beth on the first page of Louisa Alcott's Little Women ; ;
Henrietta could easily identify herself with Jo March , although Jo was not the eldest sister .
and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture .
When her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism , Sadie learned to write with her left hand .
and she recited `` Hector's Farewell To Andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight of Rabbi Jastrow at his home in Germantown near Philadelphia , where the Szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds' in Baltimore .
Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one .
This included Mamma , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as Papa had first fallen in love with her Mamma before he chose her ; ;
and when a young man like Morris Jastrow had enjoyed the Szold hospitality , he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to Henrietta , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold girls and Mamma .
To get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna , we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by Miriam in person .
One of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at Spring Green toward the end of the open warfare , on a beautiful day in June .
Miriam Noel Wright said , `` Here I am at my own home , locked out so I must stand in the road '' ! !
Then she rounded on Weston and cried , `` You always did Wright's dirty work ! !
And this is my own home '' .
The animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force ; ;
she also went to Washington and appealed to Senator George William Norris of Nebraska , the Fighting Liberal , from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard .
`` Cut off every building at the seventh floor .
and the question before these meetings was , here is a man of international reputation and proved earning power ; ;
how can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do ? ?
While this was under consideration , dauntless as ever Wright set about the building of Taliesin 3 .
nor was she moved by a letter from Wright pointing out that if he was not `` compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills , useless hotel bills , and useless doctor's bills '' , he could more quickly provide Miriam with a suitable home either in Los Angeles or Paris , as she preferred .
The Bank of Wisconsin sent a representative to the judge's chambers in Madison to give information on Wright's ability to meet the terms .
Here Wright gave a slight sigh of weariness , and continued , `` It means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people , making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding as I best can for myself and those dependent upon me '' .
but Wright stayed in the United States .
In a few weeks Miriam made another sortie at Taliesin , but was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates .
But all this , I am well aware , is the bel canto of love , and although I have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that I listened , I know well enough that it was not .
) , I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion .
I fled , however , not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise from you that the things about my bridegroom -- in the sense you meant the word `` things '' -- which you had been galvanizing yourself to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which I had already insisted upon finding out for myself ( despite , I may now say , the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle , yes , on principle , and in cold blood ) because I was resolved , as a modern woman , not to be a mollycoddle waiting for Life but to seize Life by the throat .
It assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best , and when they seem worst it overlooks them .
I had long since begun to lose my general innocence when I lost my trust in you , but this special innocence I lost before ever I loved , through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing , nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking , let alone with love .
You had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across her face .
With each song he gave verbal footnotes .
The songs Sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments .
The second reason for his popularity is his complete spontaneity with the guitar .
He is no dextrous-fingered college boy but rather a dedicated , humble , and bashful apostle of this instrument .
One cause of Schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to learn the guitar .
A knowledgeable celebrity
Carl thought the question over slowly and answered : `` I know a starving man who is fed never remembers all the pangs of his starvation , I know that '' .
In answer to a New York Times query on what is fame ( `` Thoughts On Fame '' , October 23 , 1960 ) , Carl said : `` Fame is a figment of a pigment .
There never were two fames alike .
and the laughter and the happiness are even more pronounced when no company is present .
Carl has been married to Paula for fifty-three years , and he has not made a single major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion with his wife .
Even now I will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts .
When erosion threatened the foundation of their home in Harbert , Paula Sandburg planted grapevines and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the sands away .
Lilian Steichen was an exceptional student .
At the University of Chicago she studied Whitman and Shelley , and became a Socialist .
He `` legitimized '' Paula for Lilian Steichen , and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for Charles .
Victor Berger , the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism and member of Congress , had asked Paula Steichen to translate some of his German editorials into English .
The United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet Union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice .
Now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort .
No longer is the United States the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries .
I believe that the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing nations to achieve progress .
The immediate need for this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation's international balance of payments .
Further , we must induce all industrialized nations of the Free World to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate .
But , just as we drew on Europe for assistance in our earlier years , so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination deserve help .
During the past year I have discussed this matter with the leaders of several Western nations .
No more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined .
If we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic advancement , we will make brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom .
In fourteen recent test launchings , at ranges of five thousand miles , Atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target .
This is less than the length of a jet runway -- well within the circle of destruction .
Incidentally , there was an Atlas firing last night .
Third , the United States is pressing forward in the development of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space for exploration purposes .
Fourth , in the meantime , it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth .
Using launch systems presently available , we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather ; ;
We must be ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the issues of the day .
1960 promises to be the most prosperous year in our history .
Yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders .
There , Begley lit a fire in a wire basket , and Bang-Jensen dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames .
Gross swung his swivel chair .
We were given a job and we carried it out , and later , his case was taken up by the Disciplinary Committee .
`` Don't forget , here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report .
`` For instance , regarding the fact that the Gross Committee issued two interim announcements to the press during its investigation .
`` Listen '' , he said .
But you know Bang-Jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press .
This cited Bang-Jensen's ' aberrant conduct ' '' .
He claimed you made other slanderous allegations '' .
Bang-Jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession .
`` It was foolish of him to keep them , whatever they were .
Could you comment on that '' ? ?
Mr. Stavropoulos is the U.N. legal chief and a very good man , but he is not fully versed on some technical points of American law '' .
And after all this , Shann went over all that Bang-Jensen had brought up '' .
( Shann's own report , Peter Marshall reflected , describes the encounter as `` immoderate '' .
It was a good report , he did all he could to make it a good report .
I think you are being unfair to take these things up now .
The sickness was gone and , after all , the two young couples were on their honeymoon .
Walking was the remedy , they decided , but a deck full of chicken coops and pigpens was hardly suitable .
Skipping was the alternative .
By now she was sure she was going to have a baby , deciding it would be born in India or Burma that November .
While studying at the seminary in Andover , Adoniram had been working on a New Testament translation from the original Greek .
Sometimes ships waited for days for such a man , but Captain Heard was lucky .
Next day a ship arrived with an English pilot , his leadsman , an English youth , and the first Hindu the Judsons and Newells had ever seen .
He swore so loudly at the top of his voice , that she didn't get any sleep all the next night .
Ann was entranced with the view , as were her husband and friends .
They are very small , and in the form of haystacks , without either chimney or windows .
At last they saw Calcutta , largest city of Bengal and the Caravan's destination .
Founded August 24 , 1690 by Job Charnock of the East India Company , and commonly called `` The City of Palaces '' , it seemed a vast and elegant place to Ann Hasseltine Judson .
As for missionaries , even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the Christian faith to the Burmans .
Unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate .
They explained that they desired only to stop in India until a ship traveling on to Burma could be found .
but his principal theme is that the intrigues of the Tories , `` our Popish or Jacobite Party '' , pose an immediate threat to Church and State .
In his effort to stir the public from its lethargy , Steele goes so far as to list Catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected in the event of a Stuart Restoration , and , with rousing rhetoric , he asserts that the only preservation from these `` Terrours '' is to be found in the laws he has so tediously cited .
A few days after this Englishman appeared , Defoe reported to Oxford that Steele was expected to move in Parliament that the Duke be called over ; ;
The final issue of the Englishman , No. 57 for February 15 , ran to some length and was printed as a separate pamphlet , entitled The Englishman : Being the Close of the Paper So-called .
He claims , too , that his political convictions are simply those which are called `` Revolution Principles '' and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties .
Steele first answers briefly the charges which his `` dear old Friend '' has made about his pamphlet on Dunkirk and his Crisis .
The Examiner , during Steele's trial a month later , printed an answer from the `` Courtier '' addressed to `` R. S. '' at Button's coffee-house .
In The Publick Spirit of the Whigs , it may be noted , Swift himself contemptuously dismissed Steele's reference to his friend at court : `` I suppose by the Style of old Friend , and the like , it must be some Body there of his own Level ; ;
It is filled with the usual personal abuse of Steele , especially of his physical appearance ; ;
If nothing else , at least two good songs came out of the project , `` Out Of This World '' and `` June Comes Around Every Year '' .
His father , George A. Mercer , was descended from an honored Southern family that could trace its ancestry back to one Hugh Mercer , who had emigrated from Scotland in 1747 .
But Mrs. Mercer demanded more .
With her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music -- though she waited until he was ten -- beginning with the piano and following that with the trumpet .
If his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been , Mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect .
Such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language .
But Mercer hung on , living , after a fashion , in a Greenwich Village fourth-flight walk-up .
Though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers .
he collaborated on a song with William Hartman Woodin , who was Secretary of the Treasury , 1932-33 .
His casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in absentia , were an abrupt change from Harburg's , so that Arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration .
Speaking of his work with Johnny Mercer , Arlen says , `` Our working habits were strange .
`` Some guys bothered me '' , Mercer has said .
It was here that the terror-stricken Dennis Moon played an unrehearsed role during the children's party .
That unused room was large enough for -- well , say an elephant could get into it and , as a matter of fact , an elephant did .
Something occurred on the morning of the children's party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused us .
He arrived on crutches at the Newspaper Club with one of his great pals , Oliver Herford , artist , author , and foe of stupidity .
United States Senator Royal S. Copeland was wearing the robes of Santa Claus and a great white beard ; ;
Mr. Hearst's telegraphic code word for Victor Watson was `` fatboy '' .
It was said that the Hetman plotted to take over the entire Hearst newspaper empire one day by means of various coups : the destruction of editors who tried to halt his course , the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to Mr. Hearst .
Whatever the Hetman's ambitions , his colleagues were kept ill at ease .
Some of the Hetman's `` ideas '' were dream-ridden , vaguely imparted , and at times preposterous .
Then I spent the next two days at the baseball park and at Jack Doyle's pool parlors .
When I returned to make my report , the Hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission .
Most of my stories were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me the facts , and not as a rule by playing clever tricks .
This , together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglasses , gave me the appearance of a Russian nihilist .
`` Where to , sir '' ? ?
He stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk .
The Hetman's `` ideas '' for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless or lacking in merit .
I cannot ''
It was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists .
Watson showed this wire to Colonel Van Hamm .
`` Don't bother to look any further .
The Hetman did have friends , but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession .
A little boy came to give the President his personal condolences , and the President gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in .
Backstairs , the maids cried a little over that , and the standing invitation was not mentioned to Mrs. Coolidge .
Every First Family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship .
So the President would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting Government officials to attend .
He caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate .
The favorite guest of the house , as far as the staff was concerned , was Mr. Wrigley , the chewing gum king .
Mama was very patriotic , and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the White House .
The wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind , and Mama would mend it .
One person she helped was my brother .
Mama had told her how Emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the war .
Taking a personal interest , she had the doctor assigned to the White House , Dr. James Coupal , look Emmett over .
Mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone , and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night .
She had stood at the bottom of the stairs , as usual , when Mrs. Coolidge came down , in the same dress that is now in the Smithsonian , to greet her guests .
they have observed correct neutrality ; ;
He may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs .
What shall these effects be ? ?
As a groundwork for the proposal I give some attention to the first task enumerated above , the clarification of goal .
My reply is that I associate myself with all those who affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity .
They involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any number of non-Jewish groups .
The relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said , whether he responds with anger or applause .
The symposium provides an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were addressing definite audiences -- and throughout several hundred pages everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification .
There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself , reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else .
if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work , he is helping them to achieve their own identity .
A sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these .
The rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience .
In B. M. Spinley's portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London , a salient finding was the inability to postpone gratification , a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience .
The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars , political candidates , or female beauty .
But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .
But the historian of literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic questions of form , `` texture '' , or technique .
But , in general , we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other .
The term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience .
It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .
An idea , of the sort that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination , is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images , especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience .
Thus Burns's `` My love is like a red , red rose '' and Hopkins' `` The thunder-purple sea-beach , plumed purple of Thunder '' although clearly intelligible in content , hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned .
Thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period .
Such an understanding , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter of intuition .
We may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists .
Again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating , if to our minds grotesque , anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in Lucretius , who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher Empedocles .
`` You could come down to the office once a day , look over a few exchanges , dictate an editorial , and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary labors .
If within one year you can make a success out of the American , you can practically name your own salary thereafter .
They were repelled by his noisy newspapers , his personal publicity , his presumptuous campaign for the Presidential nomination , and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses .
He sought to run Congress as he ran his New York American or Journal , a scheme veteran legislators resisted .
Yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant T. R. a semblance of a race .
The average Democratic politician , especially in the country districts , is hungry for the spoils of office .
They had lost twice with the radical Bryan , and were having no part of Hearst , whom they considered more radical than Bryan .
But there is a Hearst barrel .
''
`` The nomination of Hearst would compass the ruin of the party '' , Carmack said .
Hearst hopped into a private railroad car with Max Ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and southern states , always wearing a frock coat , listening intently to local politicians , and generally making a good impression .
But the Garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story .
Published in 1923 , it did not gain the popular acclaim of the Garibaldi volumes , probably because Trevelyan felt less at home with Manin , the bourgeois lawyer , than with Garibaldi , the filibuster .
Because Bright's speeches were so much a part of him , there are long and numerous quotations , which , far from making the biography diffuse , help to give us the feel of the man .
Nineteenth-century virtues , however , seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the Bright book has never been particularly popular .
Britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook designed `` to give the sense of continuous growth , to show how economic led to social , and social to political change , how the political events reacted on the economic and social , and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process '' .
The plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832 .
But after 1832 , the narrative tends to lose its balanced , many-sided quality and to become a medley of topics , often unconnected by any single thread .
In 1924 Trevelyan traveled to the United States , where he delivered the Lowell lectures at Harvard University .
Trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where Macaulay's History Of England had broken off .
He saw the age as one in which Britain `` settled her free constitution '' and attained her modern place in the world .
Of the three volumes , Blenheim is easily the best .
In fact , all persons were permitted to cross the Rhine into Kehl , there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river .
One of the uniformed officers stepped in my way , demanding to know whether I had permission to enter Germany .
`` Alors , you may go no farther '' , he said imperiously .
`` Is this then the frontier '' ? ?
`` Line ? ?
`` Oh ? ?
You are still in France '' .
`` Ah , then please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here '' -- I indicated the French occupation officer -- `` informs me that Germany is just on the other side of him '' .
Seeing their hesitation , I said , `` Well , until I have permission to enter Germany , or a visa to re-enter France , I shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries '' , whereupon I moved to the side of the road , parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on the sidewalk , sat down , took out my typewriter , and began typing the above conversation .
`` It will be very cold '' .
Sighting a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side , I pitched the tent that evening on the stateless `` line '' , digging a small trench around it as best I could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child .
The wind from the Rhine was damp and chill , necessitating a fire for warmth .
I had advised friends to write me to `` No Man's Land , Pont Kehl , Between Strasbourg and Kehl , France-Germany '' .
In the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of Cologne , Heidelberg , and Baden-Baden .
`` We're from the Council of Europe , British delegation .
I heard nothing more .
She entreated me to see a doctor , and when I refused , brought one out to see me .
Esther , mistaking my hesitation , assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in Strasbourg whom she had already approached .
At that moment , up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from Basel , Switzerland .
I looked from her to him .
He remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final , desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy .
Seven battle flags and fourteen officers' swords were sent to Thomas' headquarters .
The Fourteenth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes , among them being several men whose time of service had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment .
A popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the Civil War that Thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up Stanley for this assault .
It is not in the record , but he must have galloped his horse at Peach Tree Creek when he brought up Ward's guns to save Newton's crumbling line .
On the morning of September 2 the Fourth Corps and the Armies of the Tennessee and the Ohio followed the line of Hardee's retreat .
In a short time the officer returned and Thomas followed on his heels .
Lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected .
But , so far as its territorial objectives were concerned , the campaign was successful .
There was a battle on an average of once every three weeks .
Modern warfare was born in this campaign -- periscopes , camouflage , booby traps , land mines , extended order , trench raids , foxholes , armored cars , night attacks , flares , sharpshooters in trees , interlaced vines and treetops , which were the forerunners of barbed wire , trip wires to thwart a cavalry charge , which presaged the mine trap , and the general use of anesthetics .
Orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement .
As always , the ranks worked out new and better tactics , but there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their military thinking .
It failed to work .
Third , it could threaten at all times , and destroy when possible , the enemy communications .
Its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated enemy but this chance never came in the Atlanta campaign .
Sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as Thomas but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings .
Sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways , yet Garrard's Covington raid and Rousseau's Opelika raid cut two-thirds of the rail lines he had to break and Sherman lived in mortal fear of what Forrest might do to his communications .
A great part of the time , Thomas' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line .
In one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of Meynell , Thompson told Patmore of his distress at having had to leave London before this new friendship had developed further : ``
That was a very absurd and annoying situation in which I was placed by W. M.'s curious methods of handling me .
At no time does he seem to have proposed marriage , and Mrs. King was evidently torn between a concern for her daughter's emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation .
I am a great deal at the little children's Hospital .
Ever yours sincerely ,
Perhaps Mrs. Meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book , with all its mementos of her and the dear ones .
and launch them on the world when their time comes .
The poems which were addressed to her , while they are far more restrained than those of `` Love In Dian's Lap '' , show no great technical advance over those of the `` Narrow Vessel '' group and are , if anything , somewhat more labored .
As he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year and a half before , Lewis trekked southeast through Red Russia to Kamieniec .
There , along the east bank of the Southern Bug , opposite the hamlet of Zhitzhakli a few miles north of the Black Sea , he arrived at General Headquarters of the Russian Army .
Catherine's first war against the Grand Turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty quite favorable to her .
To consolidate what her Navy had won , the Czarina was fortunate that , for the first time in Russian history , her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command under her favorite Giaour .
Potemkin was directing this conflict on three fronts : in the Caucasus ; ;
the energetic Parisian , Roger De Damas , three year's Littlepage's junior , to whom Nassau had taken a liking ; ;
The Prince's perceptions were quick and his energy monstrous , but these qualities were sapped by an Oriental lethargy and a policy of letting nothing interfere with personal passions .
Lewis could let his eye caress The Prince's divan , covered with a rose-pink and silver Turkish cloth , or admire the lovely tapis , interwoven with gold , that spread across the floor .
He hadn't worn a watch or carried pocket money for years because he disliked both , but highest among his hates were looking glasses : he had snatched one from an officer's grasp and smashed it to smithereens .
He had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at Court ; ;
He often donned their tribal costumes , such as the one featuring a tall , black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels ; ;
Suvorov played parent not just to his Cossacks but to all his troops .
Seeing this , his colleague at the next desk gave a short , contemptuous laugh , pushed forward his own ash tray , innocent of a single butt , thumped his chest to show his excellent condition , and looked proud .
We went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents and more officials awaited us , the rest of the office personnel hot upon our heels .
`` You know '' , Norton said to me later , `` I am thinking of setting up the Klinico Brownapopolus .
We stopped first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned by the Parthenon .
And then perhaps one day we get to Athens .
Furthermore I can identify each design .
The columns of the Parthenon are fluted Doric .
Another classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the Evzone sentry , in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes , who was patrolling up and down in front of the palace .
Nine o'clock is the rush hour , when the busses are jammed , and by nine-thirty the restaurants are beginning to fill .
the atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home .
We went there a couple of times to swim and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly .
This agreeable state of affairs is explicable , I think , on two counts .
We were struck by the notable absence of banana skins and beer cans , but just so that we wouldn't go overboard on Greek refinement , perfection was side-stepped by a couple of braying portable radios .
For a delightful drive out of Athens I should recommend Sounion , at the end of the Attic Peninsula .
How can a cat be thin in a fish restaurant ? ?
When offered a morsel it glanced right and left and winced , obviously frightened and expecting a kick , but too hungry not to snatch the tidbit .
The game is not worth the ammunition it would cost .
Pike's honor would now come under attack , but not by Woodruff himself .
To Pike , silence was tantamount to an admission of guilt , and he determined to get Robinson onto the dueling ground at all costs .
Woodruff wanted this political windfall very badly , and everyone assumed that he would get it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter .
And , for the moment at least , the governor now found himself allied with the head of the Crittenden faction he had formerly opposed , and Pike was credited with a clear triumph over Woodruff .
On January 28 , 1835 , Andrew Jackson removed Pope from office and elevated Territorial Secretary William S. Fulton to the position .

`` Little Rock is , without any flattery , one of the dullest towns in the United States and I would not have remained two hours in the place , if I had not met with some good friends who made me forget its dreariness '' .
The orator of this period , in order to earn a reputation , had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his speech , judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect it would have on the audience that heard it .
Samuel Gorton , founder of Warwick , was styled by the historian Samuel Greene Arnold `` one of the most remarkable men who ever lived '' .
The old woman complained to the deputy governor , who ordered the servant brought before the court .
He was jailed and banished .
Gorton then moved to Providence and soon put the town in a turmoil .
This town should not be confused with Pawtucket , just north of Providence , or Pawcatuck , Connecticut , on the Pawcatuck River , opposite Westerly , Rhode Island .
Following the glorious lead of the heroes of Pawtuxet , they also submitted themselves to the protection of Massachusetts .
However , the General Court at Boston ordered the purchasers of Shawomet to appear before them to answer the sachems' claim .
The Commissioners at Boston wrote the victims to see their misdeeds and repent or they should `` look upon them as men prepared for slaughter '' .
Here was Gorton's chance to indulge in something at which he was supreme .
When Fred wheeled him back into his room , the big one looking out on the back porch , and put him to bed , Papa told him he was very tired but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown .
Papa was still elated over his afternoon visit downtown .
It began in the morning , and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one .
We got Dr. Glenn to him as quickly as we could , and we wired Tom of Papa's desperate condition .
`` He has lost much blood '' , he said .
One had to find a donor , and usually very quickly , whose blood corresponded with the patient's .
`` Mr. Wolfe had been in declining health for many years and death was not unexpected '' .
A few years before his death Papa had agreed with Mama to make a joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of the death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000 cash .
He had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands and stocks and bonds .
But he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition that he could go back to Harvard for a third year with Professor Baker .
it was demonstrated , many critics would later point out , in the length of his novels .
Tom never knew how to condense , to boil down .
He said he would do it , though probably nobody would produce it , for his own `` soul's ease and comfort '' .
Tom said he almost burst into tears , he was so disappointed and put out .
The man , Tom said , explained that it was not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort of thing the public wanted .
The public , Tom said the man told him , wanted realism , and his play wasn't that .
It was fantastic writing , beautiful writing , the man declared , but the public , he insisted , wanted realism .
I was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns and responsibilities .
Once or twice my father asked me if I wasn't overdoing a bit in my churchgoing .
Finally , after years , I gave up .
There was one further step in my religious progress .
Religion thus becomes integrated with life .
In seeking for such meaning and purpose , Albert Schweitzer seized upon the concept of the `` sacredness of life '' .
I asked one day what he was doing .
He told me that he had a big newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto the big newt .
In the face of the unfolding universe , our ultimate attitude is that of wonder .
Wonder grows .
There are some people , intelligent people , who seem to be untouched by the sea of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives .
Dr. Johnson and William Hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England ; ;
While Aristotle censors literature only for the young , Plato would banish all poets from his ideal state .
True reality , of course , is the ideal , and the poet knows nothing of this ; ;
And with this point about the passions , we encounter Plato's dualism .
Throughout the rest of the Poetics , Aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics of these six parts and their interrelationship , and he refers frequently to the standards suggested by his definition of tragedy .
The Chicago contingent of modern critics follow Aristotle so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation .
And there is one other point in the Poetics that invites moral evaluation : Aristotle's notion that the distinctive function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity and fear .
The point is that an ethical critic , with an assist from Freud , can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with a harmless outlet for our hostile urges .
It may allay our passions and so restore the rule of reason .
The second half of the sixteenth century in England was the setting for a violent and long controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature , especially the drama .
Both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle supported their cause .
Those who wanted to close the theaters , for example , pointed to Plato's Republic and those who wished to keep them open called on the Plato of the Ion to testify in their behalf .
What is not so well known , however , and what is quite important for understanding the issues of this early quarrel , is the kind of attack on literature that Sidney was answering .
Although this kind of wholesale objection came at first from some men who were not technically Puritans , still , once the Puritans gained power , they climaxed the affair by passing the infamous ordinance of 1642 which decreed that all `` public stage-plays shall cease and be forborne '' .
For this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and psychological studies of students in American colleges and universities , and particularly from the Cornell Values Studies .
hence changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals at two points in time .
Students' choices of ideal educational goals are not arbitrary or whimsical .
And , contrary to many popular assertions , the goal-values chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic success nor to mere conformity .
This finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties than the other students .
Our data indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing institutions of the society , and , in the face of the realities of complex and large-scale economic and political problems , make a wary and ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized responsibility for coping with such collective concerns .
The religious quest is often intense and deep , and there are students on every campus who are seriously wrestling with the most profound questions of meaning and value .
It exists alongside the acceptance of traditional forms of organized religion ( church , ordained personnel , ritual , dogma ) .
From New Jersey , Morgan hastened to the headquarters of Washington at Whitemarsh , Pennsylvania , arriving there on November 18th .
Morgan himself had sciatica again .
Nathanael Greene told Washington that `` Lafayette was charmed with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen '' .
Here the Pennsylvania militia skirmished with the British , but soon fled .
Similar orders were given to the Maryland militia .
A body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope , a tempting target for the riflemen , who threw a volley into their ranks and `` messed up '' the smart formation considerably .
The latter was so upset on learning of the death of Morris , that he wrote Morgan a letter , showing his own warmhearted generosity .
Morgan hotly denied this and informed the Board of War that the men in camp linked the name of Peters with the plot against Washington .
Peters insisted that this impression was a great misunderstanding , and evidently , from the quarrel , obtained an unfavorable impression of Morgan's judgment .
In order to see that this hindering situation remained effective , Washington detached several bodies of his troops to the periphery of the Philadelphia area .
If there be a disinterested patriot in America , 'tis General Washington , and his bravery , none can question '' .
He was shown a warm welcome regardless , and spent the time in Winchester recuperating from his ailment , enjoying his family and arranging his private affairs which were , of course , run down .
His soldiers on the whole did not celebrate so mildly .
Apparently no serious disorders resulted from the celebration , and within a few days , Morgan joined the force of Lafayette who now had command of some 2,000 men at Barren Hill , not far above Philadelphia on the Schuylkill .
The French were now occupying Gascony and Flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited them by a breach of the feudal contract .
To the pope , head of the universal Church , to the duke of Burgundy , taking full advantage of his position on the borders of France and of the Empire , or to Othon , who found it quite natural that he should do homage to Edward for Tipperary and to the count of Savoy for Grandson , Flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely incomprehensible .
The Frenchman's answer was a terse `` Vous dites vrai '' .
The defeat and death of Adolf of Nassau at the hands of Albert of Habsburg also worked to the disadvantage of the English , for all the efforts to revive the anti-French coalition came to nothing when Philip made an alliance with the new king of the Romans .
In spite of the armistice negotiated by Amadee two years earlier , the war between Bishop Guillaume of Lausanne and Louis of Savoy was still going on , and although little is known about it , that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle against French expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict .
In all the talk of feudal rights , the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers , nor was it easy to do so , for all along the road to Italy they passed the Florentine pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from England and rough Flemish cloth , the former to be spun and woven by the Arte Della Lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the Arte Della Calimala with the pigment recently discovered in Asia Minor by one of their members , Bernardo Rucellai , the secret of which they jealously kept for themselves .
the Low Countries , where the Middle Ages were to last for another two centuries and die out only when Charles the Bold of Burgundy met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls of Grandson .
They had my mother's opinion of him : that he was too sharp or a little too good to be true .
One of the people who was afraid of Alfred was his own brother , Lew .
It was in the spring of the year when he took to his bed and Tessie and Alfred found out that they didn't know each other .
She couldn't cook or clean or make him comfortable .
Spring was life -- and Alfred Alpert in his sickroom was death .
Alfred began to put his affairs in order , and he went about it like a man putting his things into storage .
One day Alfred told him that he had decided to leave everything to me .
He didn't want Alfred to leave me trouble because that's all it would be , and Alfred understood .
I could hear Alfred's voice a few words behind Meltzer's like a counterpoint , punctuated by sobs of sorrow and resignation .
Alfred walked past him without a word and got into the car .
Harry ran to the side of the car where Alfred was sitting and looked at him , begging him to speak .

Lilly Banks and I became friends .
Her brother Karl was a very gentle soul , her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard , probing eyes .
To me it was a game , to her it was the deadly seriousness of life .
It was unexpected , unexpected because Lilly walked with her head bent down , down , and her mark of friendship was to look into your face .
I accepted her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness ; ;
The turn of the century , or to be more precise , the two decades preceeding and following it , marks a great change in the history of early English scholarship .
It would seem that the wheel had turned full circle .
As Sir Charles Oman once said , `` it is no longer fashionable to declare that we can say nothing certain about Old English origins '' .
Despite the rejection of the traditional accounts on many points of detail , as late as 1948 it was still possible to postulate a massive and comparatively sudden ( beginning in ca. 450 ) influx of Germans as the type of invasions .
In the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars , H.M. Chadwick , R.H. Hodgkin , Sir Frank Stenton et al. who are in varying degrees sceptical of the native traditions of the conquest but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggested by them .
Everyone is more or less sceptical and virtually no one has been willing to accept Lappenberg or Kemble's position on that point .
The primary reason for the abandonment of the `` shore occupied by '' thesis has been the assimilation and accumulation of archaeological evidence , the most striking feature of early English studies in this century .
Even earlier Haverfield had come to the same conclusion .
In the face of a clear judgment from archaeology , therefore , it became impossible for a time for scholars to re-adopt the `` shore settled by '' theory .
In recent years , however , a wind of change seems to be blowing through early English historical circles .
We must , therefore , have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine the literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the problem .
in other words its existence belongs to the period of Roman Britain .
In Gaul the Saxon element on its Saxon Shore was plainly visible because there the Saxons were an intrusive element in the population .
Start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if I am obliged to go to Congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration '' .
it was Baker who thought of lessening the shock , which conscription always brings to a country , by substituting `` Greetings from your neighbors '' for the recruiting sergeant , and registration in familiar voting places rather than at military installations .
Secretary of War Baker , blindfolded , put his hand into a large glass bowl and drew the initial number of those to be called .
It was 258 .
At Camp Taylor in Kentucky a barracks was built in an hour and a half from timber that had been standing in Mississippi forests one week before .
The world-wide total of deaths from `` Spanish flu '' was around twenty million ; ;
Fosdick , a brother of minister Harry Emerson Fosdick , was a graduate of Princeton , and a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the American Philosophical Association .
He also ascertained that many officers were indifferent to the problem , including Commanding General Frederick Funston who gave Fosdick the nickname of `` Reverend '' .
Both knew that when trains stopped at Texan crossroads bored soldiers would sometimes enter to ask the passengers if they had any reading material to spare , even a newspaper .
When the United States entered the First World War Baker made certain that the Draft Act of 1917 prohibited the sale of liquor to men in uniform and that it provided for broad zones around the camps in which prostitution was outlawed .
Ultimately Fosdick's `` Fit to fight '' slogan swept across the country and every well-known red-light district in the United States was closed , a hundred and ten of them .
The wholesome activities were to be provided by many organizations including the YMCA , the Knights of Columbus , the Jewish Welfare Board , the American Library Association , and the Playground and Recreation Association -- private societies which voluntarily performed the job that was taken over almost entirely by the Special Services Division of the Army itself in World War 2 .
We no longer use the particular terms of Lessing and Victor Hugo .
It transcends the glaring fact that the Elizabethans mixed tragedy and comedy whereas the Greeks kept the two modes severely distinct .
The image of man which enters into force with Aeschylus is still vital in Phedre and Athalie .
It is the triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics which marks the point of no return .
With the Discours de la methode and the Principia the things undreamt of in Horatio's philosophy seem to pass from the world .
It banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose .
In Athens , in Shakespeare's England , and at Versailles , the hierarchies of worldly power were stable and manifest .
Princes and factions clashed in the open street and died on the open scaffold .
I have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements with regard to the character of the Greek and Elizabethan public .
They are the essential force behind the conventions of tragedy .
Concepts such as grace , damnation , purgation , blasphemy , or the chain of being , which are everywhere implicit in classic and Shakespearean tragedy , lose their vitality .
They become philosophic abstractions of a private and problematic relevance , or mere catchwords in religious customs which had in them a diminishing part of active belief .
And their chroniclers are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists .
They were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable .
From this action sprang the idea of somehow uniting Greek and Shakespearean drama into a new total form , capable of restoring to life the ancient moral and poetic responses .
The wedding of the Hellenic to the northern genius was one of the dominant motifs in Goethe's thought .
The wager between God and Satan brings on the destiny of Faust , but Faust assumes his role voluntarily .
The third Act of Faust 2 , is a formal celebration of the union between the Germanic and the classic , between the spirit of Euripides and that of romantic drama .
Mr. Bushell was mentioned in 1602 in the will of Joyce Hobday , widow of a Stratford glover .
Thomas the elder married twice , had seventeen children , and died in 1615 .
His daughter Elinor married Quiney's son Adrian in 1613 , and his son Henry married Mary Lane of Stratford in 1609 .
Sturley on November 4 answered a letter from Quiney written on October 25 which imported , wrote Sturley , `` that our countriman Mr. Wm. Shak. would procure us monei : which I will like of as I shall heare when , wheare & howe : and I prai let not go that occasion if it mai sort to ani indifferent condicions .
Sturley thought that this matter might be `` the rest of the tithes and the College houses and landes in our towne '' .
Richard Quiney the younger , a schoolboy of eleven , wrote a letter in Latin asking his father to buy copybooks ( `` chartaceos libellos ) '' ) for him and his brother .
A letter signed `` Isabell Bardall '' entreated `` Good Cozen '' Quiney to find her stepson Adrian , son of George Bardell , a place in London with some handicraftsman .
William Parsons and William Walford , drapers , asked Quiney to see to business matters in London .
He asked Quiney to find out whether the money had been paid and , if not , to send to the lodging of Sir Edward and entreat him to pay what he owed .
The chancellor of the Exchequer wrote on the petition : `` in myn opinion it is very resonable and conscionable for hir maiestie to graunt in relief of this towne twise afflicted and almost wasted by fire '' .
The queen agreed on December 17 , a warrant was signed on January 27 , and the Exchequer paid Quiney his expenses on February 27 , 1598/9 .

He was in London `` searching records for our town's causes '' in 1600 with young Henry Sturley , the assistant schoolmaster .
He also sued them for taking toll of grain at their market .
A report of Sr. Edw Grevyles minaces to the Baileefe Aldermen & Burgesses of Stratforde '' tells how Quiney was injured by Greville's men : `` in the tyme Mr. Ryc' Quyney was bayleefe ther came some of them whoe beinge druncke fell to braweling in ther hosts howse wher thei druncke & drewe ther dagers uppon the hoste : att a faier tyme the Baileefe being late abroade to see the towne in order & comminge by in hurley burley came into the howse & commawnded the peace to be kept butt colde nott prevayle & in hys endevor to sticle the brawle had his heade grevouselye brooken by one of hys ( Greville's ) men whom nether hymselfe ( Greville ) punnished nor wolde suffer to be punnished but with a shewe to turne them awaye & enterteyned agayne '' .
Impartiality to him meant an unwillingness to generalize and to search for a synthesis .
He deplored the impact of German historiography on the writing of history , terming it a `` dismal monster '' .
He pontificates that `` one of the first signs of advancing civilization is the fall in the value of women in men's eyes '' .
Brooks Adams considered religion as an extremely significant manifestation of man's fear of the unknown .
But it was nothing more than that .
This intervention could only be controlled by priests , and thus the invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class .
The dark views about the Puritans found in The Emancipation Of Massachusetts were never altered .
There had been something sinister about him that warned me against him , -- I had never felt that way about any other boy , -- but when he uttered his name on the telephone I had forgotten this and I was glad to do what he asked of me .
I had always thought of that lovable man as many years older than myself , although he was perhaps only twenty years older , and he confirmed my feeling , along with the feeling of both my sons , that teachers of the classics are invariably endearing .
I could never forget the gaiety with which , when he was both blind and deaf , he let me lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures ; ;
and once when he came to see us in New York he walked away in a rainstorm , unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella , although he was at the time ninety years old .
Finally , colleges and clubs took the line that speakers from England were not wanted any longer , even speakers like S.K. , so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized the Americans for many years .
While S.K. did not like Dylan Thomas , I liked his poems very much , but I made the mistake of telling Dylan Thomas so , whereupon he said to me , `` I suppose you think you know all about me '' .
With facts mainly in his mind , he was often acute in the matter of style , and he said , `` The young who have as yet nothing to say will try larks with initial letters and broken lines .
They would go to New York together , where parties would be piled on weariness and on misery .
`` This whole Washington venture was my last gesture , and it has failed .

When he came home from his office at the end of the afternoon , Breasted never knew what gathering he should expect to find , but there almost always was one .
When Breasted insisted that this was impossible for him , Lewis decided to go abroad .
Before he made that retreat , he telephoned Earl Blackman in Kansas City and asked him to come to Europe with him .
And when questioned by ship's reporters about the separation , she said , `` I adore him , and he adores me '' .
He was outraged by the book and announced that he had discovered fifty technical errors in its account of church practices .
In London Lewis took the usual suite in Bury Street .
His English friends , it said , had gone into training to keep up with him vocally and with his `` allegro movements around the luncheon table '' .
Lewis's remarks about his marriage were suggestive enough to induce American reporters to invade the offices of Harcourt , Brace & Company for information , to pursue Mrs. Lewis to Cromwell Hall , and , after she had returned to New York , to ferret her out at the Stanhope on upper Fifth Avenue where she had taken an apartment .
Finally , at dawn , he fell asleep , and when he awoke and came into the living room , he found Lewis in his pajamas before the fire , smoking a cigarette .
Lewis looked at him and began to cry , and then , saying that he was going to make a promise , he asked Blackman to call the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did not want .
Blackman called the porter and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy , and after that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner , or , on one of their walking trips , beer , or , in France and Italy , wine in moderation .
It was late , and Blackman was ready to go to sleep , but Lewis was not .
The list was headed by ( Henry ) Hutton of St. John's who was matriculated from St. John's at Easter , 1625 .
The fifteenth name was ( Thomas ) Baldwin , admitted to Christ's 4 March 1625 under Alsop .
Christ's College was well represented that year in the ordo , and the name highest on the list from that college was Milton's , fourth in the entire university .
He also displayed the ability to write Latin verse on almost any topic of dispute , the verses , of course , to be delivered from memory .
These were his public academic activities , domi forisque , in the college and in the university .
His statements about sports and exercises of a physical nature are suggestive , but inconclusive .
The churches , the taverns , and the various other places of the town must have known his figure well as he roved to and about them .
Graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight , wiry frame , he cut enough of a figure to have evoked a nickname in the college , to which he himself referred in Prolusion 6 : :
That is , if we can trust that most specious of prolusions , packed as it is with wit and persiflage .
In Arthur Clarke's Childhood's End ( 1953 ) , though written after the present flood of dystopias began , we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly defined .
Arriving just in time to stop men from turning their planet into a radioactive wasteland , the Overlords unite earth into one world in which justice , order , and benevolence prevail and ignorance , poverty , and fear have ceased to exist .
Among the dystopias , for example , Isaac Asimov's The Caves Of Steel ( 1954 ) portrays the deadly effects on human life of the super-city of the future ; ;
The novels and stories like Pohl's Drunkard's Walk ( 1960 ) , with the focus on adventure and with the dystopian elements only a dim background -- in this case an uneasy , overpopulated world in which the mass of people do uninteresting routine jobs while a carefully selected , university-trained elite runs everything -- are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias .
How effectively these warnings can be presented is seen in Pohl and Kornbluth's The Space Merchants , Vonnegut's Player Piano and Wyndham's Re-Birth .
Like ours , the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order to survive , and , like ours , it is based on the principle of `` ever increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption '' .
The consequences , of course , have been dreadful : reckless expansion has led to overpopulation , pollution of the earth and depletion of its natural resources .
For example , even the most successful executive lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night ; ;
Thus we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners , and the controlled .

I have changed and I have reversed opinions ; ;
So far as I am concerned , the child is unmistakably father to the man , despite the obvious fact that child and father differ greatly -- sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse .
But in ways more fundamental than specific political opinions they are still what they always were : passionate , sure without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of , capable of seeing black and white only and , therefore , committed to the logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to .
Several times in my youth I voted the Socialist ticket , but less because I was Socialist than because I was not either a Republican or a Democrat , and I voted for Franklin Roosevelt every time he was a candidate .
But he , as I can now retort , was the man who could see so short a distance ahead that after a visit to Russia he gave voice to the famous exclamation : `` I have seen the future and it works '' .
`` Well '' , I replied , `` some of my colleagues on the paper regard me as a rank reactionary '' .
Apropos of what some would call cynicism , I remember an anecdote the source of which I forget .
Not only his parishioners , but the whole town and , ultimately , the whole county were enormously impressed by this object lesson .
One day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators who wanted to know his secret .

For here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to counterbalance Existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to the tarnished image of the species Man , or , as Malraux himself puts it , `` to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves '' .
Andre Malraux's The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg was written in the early years of the second World War , during a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner by the Germans after the fall of France .
The manuscript , presumably after being smuggled out of the country , was published in Switzerland in 1943 .
and this first section was somehow preserved ( there are always these annoying little mysteries about the actual facts of Malraux's life ) when the Gestapo destroyed the rest .
Malraux pretends , perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty , that his fragmentary work will accordingly `` appeal only to the curiosity of bibliophiles '' and `` to connoisseurs of what might have been '' .
`` Man engages only a small part of himself in an action '' says old Alvear the art-historian ; ;
`` and the more the action claims to be total , the smaller is the part of man engaged '' .

This central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period from the beginning of the present century up to the first World War .
These biographical analogies are obvious , and far too much time has been spent speculating on their possible implications .
and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been done .
A good many pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families -- even when it becomes clear that the Germans are simply allowing the letters to blow away in the wind .
The entire middle section of The Walnut Trees is taken up with the life of Vincent Berger himself , whose fragmentary notes on his `` encounters with mankind '' are now conveyed by his son .
And , after becoming the right-hand man of Enver Pasha , he is sent by the latter to pave the way for a new Turkish Empire embracing `` the union of all Turks throughout Central Asia from Adrianople to the Chinese oases on the Silk Trade Route '' .

It follows that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation and coordination .
In a recent book called `` World Peace Through World Law '' , two distinguished lawyers , Grenville Clark and Louis Sohn , call for just such an overhaul of the U.N. , basing their case on the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust .
The recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement seen by some as part of the `` San Francisco Renaissance '' have been as popular as they are notorious .
In San Francisco he has worked with Brew Moore , Charlie Mingus , and other `` swinging '' musicians of secure reputation , thus placing himself within established jazz traditions , in addition to being a part of the San Francisco `` School '' .
Patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and money-hungry people .
Running counter to the destroying forces in the world are all the virtues that are innate in man , the capacity for love and brotherhood , the ability to appreciate beauty .
he has experimented instead with personal myth-making .
so during the period approximately from 1941 to 1946 , Patchen often used private detective stories as a myth reference , and the `` private eye '' as a myth hero .
Speaking in terms of sociological stereotype , the `` private eye '' might appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons .
He has , like so many other secular and religious culture symbols , gone over to the side of the ruling classes .
It is difficult to draw the line between stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician .
The musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal ; ;
He has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest symbols and devices to the new work , and the fact that he has kept a body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected continuity to his poetry .

To qualify for either type of loan , an applicant must be a small business or approved small business `` pool '' and must meet certain credit requirements .
Credit requirements
The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully and have enough capital in the business so that , with loan assistance from the SBA , it will be able to operate on a sound financial basis .
Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments -- usually monthly , including interest at the rate of 5-1/2 percent per annum on the unpaid balance -- and have a maximum maturity of 10 years ; ;
the term of loans for working capital is 6 years .

The system is composed of three credit services , Federal Land Banks and National Farm Loan Associations , Federal Intermediate ( short-term ) Credit Banks , and Banks for Cooperatives .
The third credit service , Banks for Cooperatives , exists under authority of the Farm Credit Act of 1933 .
Three distinct classes of loans are made available to farmers' cooperatives by the Banks for Cooperatives : Commodity loans , operating capital loans , and facility loans .
Interest rates are determined by the board of directors of the bank with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration .

We can help in the planning process
.
Second , we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program .
This includes assistance in -- assembling the basic economic , financial , technological , and educational information on which programing depends ; ;
To insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth .
.
Open societies can take many forms , and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals .
This includes not only development programing , but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment ; ;
( B ) the reduction of dependence on external sources .
For both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country .
Even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination .
E .
The most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention , our resources , and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries .
These cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance .
It must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba .
They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section .
In this , as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities , the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones .
I purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the State of Texas .
Many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me .
It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise , respect , and affection for Speaker Sam Rayburn .
He has become in this half century the grand old man of American history .
For Sam Rayburn never forgot Bonham , his home community , and he never forgot Texas .
The two are as one .
More than that , Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition .
And the name Rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of American politics for the last half century .
I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose .
All but two of my nine terms in the House of Representatives has been served under the Speakership of Sam Rayburn .
Remarks of Hon. John S. Monagan of Connecticut
Although Sam Rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances , nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition .
On September 16 , Sam Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud to join with others in marking this date , and in expressing my esteem for that notable American , Sam Rayburn .
Origin of state automobile practices .
At least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917 .
Unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles .
( 7 )
A survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with Rhode Island's practices .
Of these states the average `` change-over '' point ( at which a car is substituted for allowances ) is 13,200 miles per year .
Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable .
It embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be made , where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters .
The motor pool then , as now , had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state .
This tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive .
Present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , antiquated and , in general , make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment .
The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state .
The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration .
The Rhode Island property tax
This tax was discontinued in 1936 .
Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year .
Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all rateable property , both tangible and intangible , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each year '' .
This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors , who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem .
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented : ``
Practices in Rhode Island .
To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island .
In reply to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not .
It would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property .
On this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now .
Ten others made no reply .
Slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law .
Industrial Division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode Island concerns during 1960 , many of whom are still interested in a Rhode Island location .
A primary function is the operation of a Government Bid Center , which receives bids daily from the Federal Government's principal purchasing agencies .
Assistance is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations , where to obtain specifications , and follow-ups concerning qualification .
New York led in the number of inquiries , followed by California , New Jersey , Massachusetts , and Pennsylvania .
Other special mailings by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's Conference , letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors .
1184 copies of the R. I. Directory Of Manufacturers were distributed : 643 in-state and 541 out-of-state .
First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state .
( 2 )
To this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff .
( 5 )
Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program , the first step taken by the planning division to implement the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet , covering the entire state .
In addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000 .
In sixteen states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state : Alaska , Arizona , California , Delaware , Massachusetts , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , Vermont , West Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii ) .
However , only Illinois , Oregon , Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity .
Fiscal uniformity : advantages and disadvantages
He listed among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1 .
It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts .
4 .
The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements .
This greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting .
The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes .
6 .
Its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most .
Any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security .
Both the federal and state governments commence their fiscal years on July 1 .
the other , is how to finance the transition .
The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed .
Twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar .
Plans vary from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end .
An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought .
The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island , based on a July 1 to June 30 year , are shown below .
Both would start their new fiscal year on July 1 .
It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements .
each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval .
It commemorates the 185th anniversary of Rhode Island's Independence when , upon May 4 , 1776 , the General Assembly , by its action , established the first free republic in the New World .
As this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the Civil War , this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the State , but most of all paying tribute to the first Rhode Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington , putting at the disposal of President Lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time .

The first report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal .
Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile .
The element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy .
somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and Aj .
Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; ;
therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible .
Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead .
Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals .
Carbon resistors and impurity-doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region .

The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two .
Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand .
At this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad's proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads .
Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area .

Among these questions : what would a Cuba blockade take ? ?
Military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers .
To round out the blockading force , submarines would be needed -- to locate , identify and track approaching vessels .
and it must be enforced without discrimination .
What could a blockade accomplish ? ?
At times , three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports .

If they are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks .
The roof shown here ( fig. 9 ) is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete , covered with at least 20 inches of pit-run gravel .
It would have to be covered with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel .
An alternate hatchway entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials $50 to $100 .
Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction .

Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens .
In these shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide .

Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake .
The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio .
After the family has settled in the shelter , the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge .
A covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet .
A 10-gallon garbage can , with a tightly fitting cover , could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter .
The Fisher Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions .
This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about , or in attempting to bring about , the substantial lessening of competition .
The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended .
The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute .
This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court .
The first pretrial conference -- held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings -- took place on September 25 , 1957 .
No previous antitrust case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief .
and General Motors and Du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any Du Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent rights , or for a grant by General Motors to Du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies .
Du Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General Motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders .
The Court's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrones an unreality into a rule of law '' .

He claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching .
We found in Gonzales v. United States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant .
We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's contention , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it .
He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; ;
It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice , of which the Attorney General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection .

Foreign policy in its total context
I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action .
Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present .
If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs .
To cite only a few examples : The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; ;
I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them .
This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion .
If any official operation abroad begins to go wrong , we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action .
It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years , in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government .
He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented conclusions .
He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted .
He must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer .
What is the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved ? ?
And , given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support ? ?
May I add a caution on this particular point ? ?
We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action .
This is an important consideration .
We cannot test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action .
7 .
In what part of the government should the Peace Corps be established ? ?
When the aid operations are reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous , functional unit .
In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations .
How will the Peace Corps be received abroad ? ?
We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands .
If presented in this spirit , the response and the results will be immeasurably better .
For this must be the project of the whole American people .
And this is meeting the world's need , too , since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world .
The temporary Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization .
One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics , and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages , the mountains , the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations .
To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers , sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations .
There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them .
This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972 .

Improve food and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas .
They kill and destroy , retard or prevent reproduction and growth , impair and damage values , and disrupt uses .
The loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet .
This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection .

This will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection .
Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for : 1 .
Because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties , this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed .
the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ;
The existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible .
Program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows : 1 .
Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of National Forest timber , but paid for by the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices .
Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers .
The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 .
Procurement , research , and construction .
-- Approximately 45% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs .
In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $18.9 billion , compared to $19.3 billion in 1960 .
The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices .
The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it .
The Strategic Air Command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability .
This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier .
By 1965 , several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established .
The two Governments agree that the rupees accruing to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this Agreement will be used by the Government of the United States of America , in such manner and order of priority as the Government of the United States of America shall determine , for the following purposes in the amounts shown : ( A )

The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from 540 kc. to 1600 kc. .
The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective radiated power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day .
With the existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances .
The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service .
A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies .
It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions , and vice versa , is not an instantaneous process , but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset , and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise .
For this reason , the more uncertain skywave service was denominated `` secondary '' in our rules , as compared to the steadier , more reliable groundwave `` primary service '' , and , for both skywave service and skywave interference , signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service , 10 percent of the time for skywave interference .
6 .
( 2 )
To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible .
With respect to skywave service rendered at night , class 1 , -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 , -- A operation , and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received ; ;
In the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies , the provision of long-range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities , and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible .
Additional class 2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities .
Such additional daytime class 2 , assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies , and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them .
10 .
Since then , there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena .

Nonresident aliens in Puerto Rico .
His return for the period January 1 to June 20 , 1961 , is due April 16 , 1962 .
Any failure to file timely returns or make estimated tax payments when due must be fully explained .
Citizens of the United States who , on April 15 , are not in the United States or Puerto Rico , are allowed an extension of time until June 15 for filing the return for the preceding calendar year .
You must attach a statement to your return , if you take advantage of this automatic extension , showing that you were in Alaska or were outside the United States or Puerto Rico on April 15 or other due date .
All checks and money orders should be made payable to Internal Revenue Service .
Send your return to the Director of Internal Revenue for the district in which you have your legal residence or principal place of business .

and they are dashed , no less , by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit .
They are chosen by the Foundation's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts .
That we had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr. Lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been , it may be said truly , pretty uniformly good .
But the facts about our Advisory Board and its members' duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice , both reliable and imaginative , on which to base our selections of Fellows .
The Trustees of the Foundation appointed Dr. Ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary General upon the latter's eventual retirement .
The effective recognition of excellence and its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day , nor even in a year .
For , granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved , these problems make great demands ; ;
Of this , examples are legion : Pericles speaking his funeral oration in Ancient Greece's extremity after Thermopylae and making it a testament of freedom ; ;
It gives , indeed , cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced ; ;
Nevertheless , they made naught of Marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use Marx's word -- more than a subsistence wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists' pockets with the result , in turn , that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase .
Sir Henry Sumner Maine , a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with , wrote his brilliant legal generalization , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract '' .
For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future .
But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress .
Indeed , if pressed , we would say what the late Robert Henri , American painter , said to a pupil , `` Anything will do for a subject : it's what you do with it that counts '' .
When the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world .
That development , in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular graduating , in index drilling , and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement .
As one development followed another , the company's reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture .
As the story goes , Mr. Gibbs , who originally came from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine .
Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture .
The new work was a boon to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment .
The original machine , bearing its famous serial number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe Precision Center in Providence .
The micrometer caliper , as a common workshop tool , also owes much to J. R. Brown .
He was an ardent champion of the Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company .
During the early part of this century , the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world .
This program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money .
Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill , the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time upgrading quality .
A new application for the Unifil loom winder , running single filling for box looms , will broaden mill use of this equipment .
We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field .
In addition to its major effort on fuel cells , Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account .

It inspires confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and to achieve them .
To provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions , a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research .
Budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship .
Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money , an institution should choose its fields of prominence .
The president should find strong subordinates and delegate the widest discretion to them .
Higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world , but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income .
Just as the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy and objectives , so should non-academic officers .
Introduction
Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves , although opaque to infrared radiation .
The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc .
At meter wave lengths an increase of the order of 10-degrees in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected .
Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length range .
The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 .
Introduction
The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up Af .
It is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .
Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces .
Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder .
The graphite was National Carbon NC 60 , which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 .
Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 .
Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug .
This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously .
The mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug .
It was denoted by Af .
They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements .
It was calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af .
The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby Af .
A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 .
Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate .
It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus .
These experiments can be considered exploratory only .
This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared .
This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions '' .
Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45-degrees to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear .
) This is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies .
( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions .
( C ) The kinetic effects are negligible .
This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible .
This conformational entropy is , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes or other energies involved .
Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) .
The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the Af bond in Af remains in doubt .
Af bond in Af
Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical Af distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric .
There is ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric .
The Af distance in Af is 2.26 Aj .
If the Af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ;
A randomization of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists .
A very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is formed , water-washed by centrifugation , and dried at 110-degrees-C ) .
Thermogravimetric analysis showed a weight loss of 1.8% centered at 337-degrees-C and another weight loss of 10.8% at 463-degrees-C .
Magnetic analyses by R. G. Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities .
The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller than this .
One measurement at 40 Mc/sec was obtained with the Varian model Af unit .
Background spectra were obtained in all cases .
Field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first moment is zero .
The temperature was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) .
1 .
Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube .
This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above .
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ;
Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork .
The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders .
These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 .
Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material .
One gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of Af .
A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; ;
As is the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high .
In addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids , including liquid greases .
and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove .
( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 .
In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant .
Then during washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase .
Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil - water interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure ( see Table 26-2 on p. 1678 ) .
The crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as : Af .
Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` synergistic '' properties has gained widespread acceptance .
In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation ; ;
Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction .
The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions .
The mixture was then extracted with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was distilled on a Vigreux column , a 25% center cut being retained which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of Af .
Both types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220-degrees .
Changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell .
the thermal reaction .
The liquid phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange , although still erratic .
Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85-degrees in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity .
Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at Af .
This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved .
At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain .
In addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain .
The cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category .
Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products contribute some information .
There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable .
for the next two days , the impact rate was Af ; ;
The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor .
There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin .
The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of Af in the U.S. work and Af in the U.S.S.R. work .
However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as Af .
To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown .
The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors .
The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta .
These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple's table .
For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per cent .
This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx .
Biological warfare
In considering BW defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect .
There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens , restaurants , food stores , hospitals , etc. .
Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials :
There was a slight lapse condition , a moderate fog , and 100 per cent relative humidity .
A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore .
All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours .
In this instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period , a four-fold increase .
They do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives .
Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target .
The major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices .
It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons .
These include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses .
samples .
The second contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of 1 : 256 in albumin and 1 : 2048 by the indirect Coombs test .
In addition one serum was obtained from a donor ( R. E. ) who had been sensitized 6 years previously .
The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect Coombs techniques .
Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for use in the present study .
Chromatography .
Each initially contained 1700 ml of buffer ; ;
Ultracentrifugation .
There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti-A and anti-B activity in group O serum , though in two group O donors ( J. F. and E. M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) .
Several samples of citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn et al .
These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group AB plasma as a control .
The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig. 1 ) .
In all cases the activity against Af cells was spread over a wider area than that with Af cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect Coombs ) used for comparison .
This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; ;
Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease .
Those are the nectaries or honey glands ( Fig. 26 , page 74 ) .
The only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites .
If you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North American species is Bumblebees And Their Ways by O. E. Plath .
When the larvae hatch , they feed on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother .
The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed .
The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets -- naturally ! !
Later on , they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers .
The males are much duller .
Although Andrena is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee .
Nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great Plains , for example , in Utah and central Washington .
This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington , but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and Prosser in July or August , when the bees are in their most active period .
Laurence M. Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults .
Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length .
Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda .
I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; ;
data on the boa constrictor about match this .
Another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity .
red-bellied snake ( Storeria ) , two years ; ;
Measurements of skins are of little value ; ;
In spite of all the pitfalls , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants .
This approach rejects virtually all field measurements .
Oliver has recently used the second-level approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions : the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet , the reticulate python 33 , the African rock python 25 , the amethystine python at least 22 , the Indian python 20 , and the boa constrictor 18-1/2 .
Bernard Heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda .
His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength , but these seem to be given to complete his picture , not to be believed .
Discussions of the giants one by one will include , as far as possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; ;
Anaconda :
At birth , this species varies considerably in size .
A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield Zoo , near Chicago , ranged in length from 22 to 33-1/2 inches and averaged 29 inches .
Lawrence E. Griffin gives measurements of nineteen young anacondas , presumably members of a brood , from `` South America '' ; ;
Beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces .
Hans Schweizer had one that increased from 19-1/2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and J. J. Quelch records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years .
The range is from 14 to 25 inches ; ;
The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout .
No bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group .
It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules ; ;
In this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1 .
As in type 1 , , it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen ( figs. 9 , 10 ) .
The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined .
Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , '54 ) in the human being .
In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz .
'25 ) .
Nakamura ( '58 ) , Verloop ( '48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( '50 ) , Von Hayek ( '53 ) , and Tobin ( '52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being .
Miller ( '50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint .
Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this .
Our own studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards .
It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable .
This viewpoint is further supported by Verloop's ( '48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves .
In other words , the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts .
In addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses .
Type 1 , is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; ;
The pleura is extremely thin in type 2 and septa are absent .
True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present .
In the lower portion of each Chart , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified .
There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls .
The lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly , since only two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region .
The lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood .
Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as well as Hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood .
It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls .
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ;
Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ;
De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) .
Antithyroid drugs
The other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil .
Any of the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism .
In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 **ymg per day .
The name thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so tested for its presence .
At the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of Af .
The first attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later , when Janssen and Loeser ( 1931 ) used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities .
Pierce , Carsten and Wynston , 1960 ) .
First , is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored ? ?
A .
Standard preparations and units of thyroid-stimulating activity
The international unit ( u. ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories ( Mussett and Perry , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International Standard Preparation .
The international unit is equipotent with the USP unit adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the USP reference substance .
The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia .
Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive of myelofibrosis .
This medication was continued until February , 1958 .
In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone marrow and controlling any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was begun on Sept. 26 , 1958 , and continued until Feb. 18 , 1959 .
Triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was resumed and maintained until Feb. 18 , 1959 .
A Schilling test demonstrated normal absorption of vitamin Af .
In February , 1959 , during the second admission to The New York Hospital , a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections .
Muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then crutches .
These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism .
The parenchyma was slightly hyperemic in the apex of the left lung , and there were several firm , gray , fibrocalcific nodules measuring as large as 3 mm. .
The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent , and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin .
A section of the colon revealed intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulcerations of the mucosa , associated with much fibrin and many neutrophils .
Cultures taken from the jejunum yielded Monilia albicans , Pseudomonas pyocanea , Aerobacter aerogenes , and Streptococcus anhemolyticus .
On the surface of the right kidney there were also 2 yellow , firm , friable raised areas measuring up to 2 cm. in diameter .
Throughout , there were marked arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles .
The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty replacement .
Microscopically , there were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity .
Occasionally there were small basophilic fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli ( Fig. 5 ) .
( 3 ) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 ) .
( 4 ) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Af potassium phosphate and Af .
As controls other sections were similarly covered with Aj .
Direct method .
Fluorescence microscopy
In the eyepiece a Wratten 2 B filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light .
In the first few experiments Af was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder .
Unstained sections mounted in buffered glycerine or sections treated only with NS or Af did not show such green fluorescence .
In all the above procedures , when the intermediate sera were diluted to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with 0.85% saline , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced , whereas , a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 : 500 or diluting the Af to 1 : 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence .
With this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections with 1 : 10 dilution of Af for 30 minutes , washing with PBS for 15 minutes , staining with Af for 30 minutes , and washing with PBS for 15 minutes .
This conjugate was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method .
The best staining procedure with this purified Af consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30 minutes and washing in PBS for 15 minutes .
Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors .
The virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue .
No antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells .
In the indirect method , this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with NS and Af or with Af only .
After Af and Af were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present .
It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism .
In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates .
But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex .
On the other hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored .
Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system .
Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus .
Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect .
The shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance .
They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side .
In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs .
Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity .
Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain .

We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary .
One sees that this happens because the null space of Af has dimension 1 only .
Let Af be the null space of Af .
( B ) each Af is invariant under T ; ;
The idea of the proof is this .
Since Af and P divides Af for Af , we have Af .
If Af , then Af is divisible by Af and so Af , i.e. , Af .
But then it is immediate that Af , i.e. , that **ya is in the range of Af .
By Theorem 10 , D is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of T .
Let N be a linear operator on the vector space V .
Let T be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F .
Suppose that the minimal polynomial for T decomposes over F into a product of linear polynomials .
hence they commute with D and with N .
Since D and D' are both diagonalizable and they commute , they are simultaneously diagonalizable , and Af is diagonalizable .
( Actually , a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its T power 0 ; ;
It then follows that Af is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression .
Example 11 .
If Af is the null space of Af , then Theorem 12 says that Af .
Thus , the study of the solutions to the equation Af is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form Af .

A trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times .
What can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes ? ?
When three dice are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of aces is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ? ?
Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' .
If three dice are tossed , a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials .
Each Friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck .
The 2 possible outcomes on each trial are `` driver '' or `` nondriver '' .
The managers stay the same , so that Af is the same for all weeks .
For the marksman , we study sets of five shots ( Af ) ; ;
and for the aces , we toss three dice ( Af ) .
`` Success '' and `` failure '' are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial trials in general .
Experiment where p is not constant .
During a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman , lowering his chance of a bull's-eye .
An experiment consists of the voting of one couple , or two trials .
The table shows that 0.6 of the boys and 0.6 of the girls vote for picture A .
) On the other hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; ;
Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results .
Indeed , the spiral Af , with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square .
We now have certain squares with three corners on C .
If the vertex is at Af , and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90-degrees about the vertex .
With each vertex we associate certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the parameter T between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points .
Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point .
In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af .
The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point .
In some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say Af , the function Af is either double-valued or has no values defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is single-valued .
The number of ordinary values of the function f{t} at T will be called its multiplicity at T .
Proof
Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane ; ;
otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points .
We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C .
We erect a square with PQ as a side and with free corners Af and Af adjacent to P and Q respectively .
In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers .
Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1 .
For if it did , the plane of L and l' would contain two generators of Af , which is impossible .
Since the complex of singular lines is of order K and since there is no complex of invariant lines , it follows from the formula Af that the order of the involution is Af .
Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents .
In particular , tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C' .
Since two curves of symbol Af on Q intersect in Af points , it follows that there are Af lines of Af which are tangent to Aj .
A conic , C , being a ( 1 , 1 ) curve on Q , meets the image of any line of Af , which we have already found to be a Af curve on Q , in Af points .
Hence its image , C' , meets any line of Af in Af points .
Hence **zg must have either a regulus of Af-fold secants or a regulus of Af-fold secants .
This contradicts the preceding observations , and so , under the assumption of this paper , we must reject the possibility that **zg is a Af curve on a quadric surface .
We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene .
When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development .
The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communications between the two .
In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals .
For example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; ;
At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth .
But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; ;
They must in their planning be able to count on at least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years .
Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward .
There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved .
It follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon .
If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ;
the instrumentalities follow .
life leads somewhere .
It gives him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate .
He has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie .
The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies .
In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution .
The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions .
Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; ;
This is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United States ; ;
and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds .
Historically , religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions .
These needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension .
The initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking sense .
Thus , the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf .
While some suppression and some denial are not only necessary but healthy , the worker's clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used , what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated , and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed .
At certain critical stages , and only for sound diagnostic reasons , it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive rather than defeating .
For example , the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project .
Willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the proviso that if the interpretation is too threatening , the worker can withdraw ) is another prominent feature in these efforts .
The norms , as elements , refer to `` all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system '' .
The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population .
Power .
Again , size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls .
Roles of various types , within the larger system and within the subgroups 3 .
By means of geographical isolation and high fertility rates , inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained .
The values placed by the Brandywine population , upon maintaining a certain homogeneity , a certain separate racial identity , and therefore a certain separate social status , are important for the morale of the system .
In turn , higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population , allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity .
Loomis considers six such processes in his paradigm .
Systemic linkage
4 .
Communication .
However , the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation .
Group pressures toward conformity are slight or non-existent , and deviant behavior in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions .
Boundary maintenance .
`` Increased boundary maintenance may be achieved , for example , by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern .
'' The external pattern or external system can be considered as `` group behavior that enables the group to survive in its environment .
It is also expressed in the proscription against deviants in the matter of endogamy , particularly in rural areas .
In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered .
But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors .
The district officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics .
The cards , filed by circonscription ( sub-chiefdom , or village ) , are kept in the headquarters of each territoire ( chiefdom ) .
Additional entries must be made from time to time .
But it places a severe strain on the administrative resources ( already burdened in other ways ) of a widely dispersed , poor and largely illiterate population .
The distinction between domiciled ( de jure ) and present ( de facto ) population was not clearly defined .
The system tended to break down during the war , but was reactivated ; ;
But the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading .
Here again it seems that useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods .
Eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central Statistical Office .
The 1952 demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by V. Neesen , a member of the IRSAC staff , though the inquiry was carried out under the auspices of AIMO , which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory .
These teams carried out the same operations successively in different areas .
About 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation , as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries .
Uniform questions , definitions , and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country .
In the reports , summary results are given for both the de facto ( A and C ) and de jure ( A and B ) populations ; ;
The population registration system still has important functions .
It provides a frame for the sampling census .
Even though the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present ( especially children in relatively stable communities ) and supplementary information ( such as records of marital status ) for many others .
The quality of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries .
This report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables .
However , all admitted that the `` hindsight '' was not altogether lost .
A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students .
This did not mean that married students could not enroll in other `` mixed '' sections , and some of them , largely because of scheduling difficulties , did .
This action was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores .
This has subsequently been verified by the experience .
In the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged .
Incidentally , it needs to be noted that because auditors were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week , until at last it swelled to such proportions that this `` free '' auditing policy had to be retracted .
After that , we began to get `` visitors '' to class .
It ranged from two women members who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive .
We already have courses covering those problems , and so on .
But within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible .
Though it did not become known to the writer for some time , a nucleus group had sprung up within the class .
( 1 ) A great deal of time was spent on processes for solving marital differences .
This was not a search for a `` magic formula '' , but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially to all types of communication in marriage .
This added a personal zest to class discussions and participation .
In fact , we had one birth before the end of the course , and another student had to take the final examiantion a week early , just to be on the safe side .
Responses such as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic .
Guilford-Martin personality inventories .
One subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax .
A differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their naive Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion .
A suggestion Hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of `` normal '' reactions different from those which they gave .
There was no implication made that their initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) was less preferred than the presence of levitation .
After two drinks containing alcohol , her arm flew upward very freely .
There was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement .
Many subjects attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control -- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it .
They felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction .
When informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up , she commented , `` I don't see how they can prevent it '' .
Control of socioeconomic status
The unstructured schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle- to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area .
In order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods .
Twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured schools furnished 156 cases , 87 boys and 69 girls .
The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records , categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records .
There is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees .
The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity .
The predicted interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement .
In this manner , the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled , allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables .
No significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school .
The most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools .
The fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit .
Failure confirms the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced .
By the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words .
The antagonists came in , one at a time , and did not see or hear the other presentations .
and so did the observers consisting of the president , three of his salesmen and a psychologist .
The position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions .
He seemed to antagonize everyone .
Despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him .
The necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms .
The manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up , and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard .
To want to change is the third step .
Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training .
The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area .
I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city .
but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you '' ! !
Again , I at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased .
Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice .
I have found , time and again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in the final analysis , on this basis ; ;
Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple-seeming verbal or nonverbal statement .
One finds , for example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most unconventional of meanings .
, the patient replied , `` Both , Dearie -- two in one '' .
this is a question which I have no wish to take up -- condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another .
Freeman , Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation '' .
In my experience , a great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience .
Or , equally often , a concretistic-seeming , particularistic-seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry -- may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a smile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking .
For English the reduction in size is less striking .
This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word .
Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis .
We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text .
A random-storage scheme , based on the spelling of forms , provides an economical way to compile this text-form list .
Also , the dictionary is divided into at least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms .
If cell Af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list , it is now assigned as the information cell of Af .
When this situation exists , the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af .
The address Af is stored in the cell Af .
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
A third situation is possible .
Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain ; ;
the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain .
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read .
A random address Af that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form .
When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage .
The grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis .
) When the complete file has been read , the grammatical descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region ; ;
Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form .
The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it .
In sentences , patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here .
There is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes .
But the parallel is significant .
From the point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement is the predicator has broken , and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking ; ;
but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence .
If the answer to what was that noise ? ?
In I knew you when you were a child , and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty .
Often , dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion .
Sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship .
Here again , in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics , but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context .
In I wanted to tell him , but I was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him .
When ity is added , real clearly has two syllables .
Analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple .
But it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics .
The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features .
Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other .
The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used .
Smaller systems can of course be stated much more succinctly .
And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics -- at least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures .
The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried over from European languages .
Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance .
In the process , he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult .
One other paper deals with a phonologic problem : Vowel Harmony In Igbo , by J. Carnochan .
This restates the already widely known facts in terms of prosodies .
W. H. Whiteley writes on The Verbal Radical In Iraqw .
The result is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ;
( 3 ) adjectives ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ;
5 .
For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems .
While the particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially arbitrary , they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material , and they eventuate also in five classes , along a similar scale , containing approximately equal numbers of cases , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in Athabascan .

but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between M-K and I-E ) .
His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material .
As to relative frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc. ) , Thomas with his ' weighting ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have .

And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones .
Some of this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence .

I would propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved .
Doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies .
The long delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage .
After `` a prolonged study of the Oder line on a map '' , at Teheran , Churchill `` liked the picture '' .
He would tell the Poles , he said , that they had been `` given a fine place to live in , more than three hundred miles each way '' .
At Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans who would have to leave , trying to find work in Germany , and Roosevelt objected to the Western Neisse River being chosen in the south , instead of the Eastern Neisse , both of which flow into the Oder .
Government .
Though little democracy had ever been practised in this region , and much of it was still ruled by feudalistic means , it was taken for granted that at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this area and Western capitalism preserved within it .
Believing devoutly as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions , it was important to both Roosevelt and Churchill that the Poles should have them .
He made this completely clear .
Speaking with `` great earnestness '' , he said : `` For the Russian people , the question of Poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security .
Throughout history , Poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into Russia .
Therefore , it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the Soviet state '' .
But at Yalta the conflicting expectations of East and West were merged into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all liberated countries in Europe `` to create democratic institutions of their own choice '' .
Later it developed that the Soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy , which will be discussed later , and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should unite in establishing democratic conditions , as we understand them , within their zone of influence .
Here is the best short explanation of the origins of the Cold War that has been written .
The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting .
Considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach .
A third aspect , and probably the one open to most controversy , is the results of the election .
Elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence .
Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious .
Until the Charter of Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes .
But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity '' of the Balafrej Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign policy , labor politics and economic development .
They were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new , constructive national effort .
Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process .
At the central level the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form of the scrutin de liste system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political parties .
The general setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization .
The concentration of effective power in Rabat leads not only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections .
The value of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table 1 .
As the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections .
The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P. members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders .
Since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P.
Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future .
The latest major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act .
Even the states remain primarily in an assisting role , providing leadership and teacher training .
The greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds .
There is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education .
Courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs ; ;
The existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled .
While the U. S. Department of Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning .
Elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills .
A training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community .
Another problem is who will pay for the training .
However , if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment .
This expectation is what really `` sold '' point and figure .
After all , too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long .
The advantages and disadvantages of these two types of charting , bar charting and point and figure charting , remain the subject of fairly good-natured litigation among their respective professional advocates , with both methods enjoying in common , one irrevocable merit .
The markets are far too subtle , and the last word in these endeavors will doubtless never be written , for the enchanting index is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth .
We mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago .
Falling most easily prey to an adverse market movement , for this rank of traders can least afford to lose , virtually anything the odd-lot traders do , marketwise , is taken to exemplify the `` wrong '' thing to do .
They might , for example , plot it exactly as is , or they might make ten day moving averages of it , or longer moving averages , or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales .
One might well wonder why the `` public is always wrong '' and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg .
Does the `` public '' usually sell at bottoms , or does the market usually bottom out when the `` public '' sells ? ?
weak hands react .
Needless to say , strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands , for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up , at higher prices , during the run-up phase of the campaign .
Moreover , the taunt concerning the `` sophisticated '' echelon and its alleged erudition is put to test during every campaign , and accrues only upon results ; ;
Mr. Alexander H. Wheelan's Study Helps In Point And Figure Technique tells the readers : `` We assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the securities and commodities markets '' .
Nevertheless , all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible modes of expression , if they lead to a market committment at all .
Chapter 6 , more methods
By and large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates .
Moreover , the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates .
Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity .
The 2% increase in retail sales in October to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference Board , which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans .
My answer is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies , and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels .
This view is based upon several basic economic forces which I believe will be operating in the Sixties , as follows : ( 1 )
Recent events in the General Assembly of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us , and probably intensify , for the foreseeable future .
During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping up in the rate of household formations , which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building .
During the Seventies the projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of 1,338,000 in the second half of that decade .
Accordingly , the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the general economic prospects of the Sixties .
However , the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated .
( 5 )
For example , the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans for housing under the VA home loan guaranty program seems to have largely exhausted itself .
Markets should become more competitive as consumers become more selective .
Where the industry's product price has been kept below the `` profit-maximizing '' and `` entry-limiting '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands .
Part 4 , is a brief summary .
Price competition is lacking .
The manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given .
)
C .
For the industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry-limited price ( but not below average cost ) .
In such circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate .
Since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter .
Where this approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure .
They become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail .
Notice , however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per se , without an accompanying wage increase .
Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry , much less to the union or to the public .
Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be shared .
However , it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude .
Thus , for non-negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage-setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence .
Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century .
International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense .
Political interference in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America ( though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine , itself from the outset related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance '' itself .
This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19th century scholars .
More emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; ;
During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today .
No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do ; ;
A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent .
Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed .
Whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law .
It was , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by no means an immoral or amoral one .
Man , through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny .
The theory did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique .
Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society .
that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; ;
In fact , some -- Anzilotti is the principle example -- went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal norm , Pacta sunt Servanda .
One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations .
One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference .
Reluctant , as usual , to interpret state legislation -- such interpretation can only be a `` forecast rather than a determination '' -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter led a unanimous Court to vacate the injunction .
`` The resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication '' .
To the extent that the jurisdictional principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation , federal equitable relief against state action must be available -- or so it seems to Mr. Justice Frankfurter .
The railroad , claiming deprivation of property without due process of law , sought injunctive relief .
The Court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be obstructed ; ;
The Court held that Congress had intended the federal judiciary to `` fashion '' an appropriate law of labor-management contracts .

or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381(c)(16) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ;
It is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes .
and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code .
The leading case , Seaboard Air Line Railway v. United States , held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed .
The anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the American corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the British corporation .
if the succession is not of record , all documents relating to such succession , properly certified , are required .
If the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim , it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes .
Section 203 of the United States Code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the Government transferred in tax-free reorganizations .
However , a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for a person acquiring emergency facilities .
For example , suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted , providing for carryover of excess profits credits .
There is also the question of whether the respondent based his answers on factual information and carefully considered judgment , or whether his answers were casual guesses .
and ( 3 ) the attitudes and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and the methods of awarding defense contracts .
The major sections of the questionnaire ( see Appendix B ) are devoted to the following : 1 .
The questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was optional .
The responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the respondent .
The firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind .
The second list was derived from a group of approximately 8,000 names supplied to the research team by the Aerospace Industries Association .
The first test mailing ( to 14 companies ) was made in June , 1960 .

The remaining 1,286 returns that were processed came from the categories in Table 2 .
The cards were then processed using standard IBM punch card equipment , including an IBM 650 computer .
The returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms .
It was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in , or wishing to sell to , defense programs .
The vast Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world .
We have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose .
Inevitably , one side was pleased and the other displeased , regardless of how we ruled .
For a number of years , there have been sporadic attempts in California to organize farm workers .
Regardless of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties , failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life .
Infrequently do we think of it as a living , continuing , operating control over the system .
With respect to labor disputes , the Wagner-Peyser Act states only ,
In carrying out the provisions of this Act , the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they are referred to employment .
Other provisions of the Act empower the Secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions , and he has done so .
The pertinent regulation for our purposes is Section 602.2 ( , ) , as follows :
Into court
The court issued a temporary restraining order , directing us to resume referrals .
It is an issue which may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial finality is achieved .
The impact of noncompliance under the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear : the withdrawal of some $11 million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or , as a corollary , the taking over by the Federal Government of its operation .
Here the problem is essentially one of defining the word `` filling '' .
Should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job specifications , union membership , union jurisdiction , and the like ? ?
that is , that if wages , for example , is the only issue in a labor dispute , and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute , we may continue to make referrals .
How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics .
Concerning this responsibility of the teacher , suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in Chapter 11 .

The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups .
Why the teacher should study the individual pupil
These specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention , by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom , and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children .
Studies conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally , and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects .
It is apparent , therefore , that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children .
The curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others .
A vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading disability for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading .
The classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist ; ;
This section deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom teacher ; ;
Only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records .
Each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date .
Some school systems provide written instructions to principals and teachers designating when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used .
The Summary Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region , 1959 - 1960 '' clearly shows two pieces of information .
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan .
They vex us and perplex us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems .
In general , members of NAIRO would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence zone .
Can we help children adjust to `` images of other children '' when the latter are not actually present .
Now , the issues
Or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other school , we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school -- namely , to a teacher of another race .
Should Congress authorize the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance ? ?
Even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the Attorney General to act was eliminated , should we nevertheless support such a clause ? ?
Should we support a clause in Federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny Federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a child on account of his race ? ?
There is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause , softened though it be , on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary to the public schools .
Required public education .
Issue no. 6 .
In general , it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society .
Again , in deciding on the content and method of his teaching , does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the race for higher economic status , or does he favor a curriculum which strengthens students in other ways ? ?
In a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class backgrounds , Wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as well as on his social-class background .
Their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born parents , who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum .
Legislators are one such group , and state legislators have major responsibility for educational legislation .
In general , it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the interests of the society as a whole .
They are predominantly middle- and upper-class people , and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes .
The recent federal government's student-loan program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to lower-status youth .
One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs .
1 .
In recent years , this burden ( which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic ! !
The general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis .
There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- notably , the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' .
In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant .
These minimum costs may come to $1 per month , more or less , for residential and small commercial customers , although they are substantially higher for large industrial users , who require more costly connections and metering devices .
It has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation .
)
247 - 83 ) and Hempel ( 1959 : :
) Functionalism as a sociological credo is , therefore , not a direct consequence of observations , but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment .
Such a position entails the negation of philosophy in its Platonic form as something soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences .
In this situation , philosophy has survived by separating itself from metaphysics , by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions .
In this connection , it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were exploited .
Philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed .
135 - 75 .
for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science .
When dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge , or better the role of philosophy in assisting research on the social sources of ideas , one has to become necessarily selective .
Men have always lived in a tentative world , and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary .
Without such uncertainty we are left with a set of dogmas and myths .
The functional interplay of philosophy and science should , as a minimum , guarantee a meaningful option to myth-making .
But neither was the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard .
To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery .
Now I do not think their view will do .
This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply .
The theory claims to show by analysis that when we say , `` That is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking .
I shall argue that we do mean to do just that .
Let us work through an example , and the simpler and commoner the better .
There is perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad .
On that view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came on the scene and made my remark .
If so , then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only .
It removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds it should be .
If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken .
The pathetic evidence is no longer before us ; ;
but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense .
and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright .
( 2 ) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations ; ;
that is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual space '' .
We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation .
The answer the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance .
The supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as well as the direction and scope of a movement , passively executed ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on the contrary , very considerably affected '' .
( 1 ) When an object was placed in the patient's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; ;
that is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was .
But before we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; ;
If , however , the figure to be discerned were complicated , composed of several interlocking subfigures , and so on , even the tracing process failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts .
This meant , concretely , that the patient could not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` hasher marks '' inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it .
and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him .
Therefore , his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; ;
And the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it .

Geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough , detailed study which it deserves , partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations , as at Argos , are only now coming to light .
Much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 .
While Protogeometric vases usually turn up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non-Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century .

Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him .
There were three houses in Salyer's Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and then passing down in front of the houses , thence to the Vermejo .
Dropping to one knee , Cook felled one , and the other struggled off with his comrade , sending no further fire in his direction .
Before daylight Sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco Chaves , where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered .
MacPherson boldly approached the fortified adobe house and demanded entrance .
Since the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants , MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw .
The posse's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be overbearing and impudent .
While prowling around these buildings , two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside .
The sheriff and District Attorney Mills hastily swore out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed , according to signed statements by Chavez and Dr. I. P. George , and ordered Deputy Barney Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman .
Traveling all night , Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22 .
Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills , disappearing at the posse's approach .

More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone -- because he wrote Utopia .
we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia .
What is new about it ? ?
it can be made in two words , Utopian communism .
Surely there is nothing new about communism .
In More's Utopia communism is not a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass .
`` The soil is common to all men .
Because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his .
In contrast to this Stoic-patristic view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve .
The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions .
In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original -- a new thing .
What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church Fathers of Late Antiquity .
On October 31 , 1859 , John Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder .
Upon receiving the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia .
On Wednesday morning , November 2 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial .
J. Wheaton Smith , editor of the Warren Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in order that all those misnamed philantropists , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly '' .
There was no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state .
`` E. B. '' compared John Brown to Moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression .
Most attempts to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive audience in Rhode Island .
The Newport Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him .
In her letter to John Brown , `` E. B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington .
On November 22 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions .
In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled .
Despite the opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt Hall meeting `` brought together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering '' .
The latter two were appointed secretaries .
Although admitting Brown's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; ;
He recalled that in Rhode Island a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man ( Thomas W. Dorr ) proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty .
To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ;
The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion .
Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before .
In their very first collages , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real , bas-relief space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface .
Yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump '' .
At the same time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in relation to the block capitals ; ;
It was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for the first time , mutually exclusive alternatives .
Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to the extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; ;
It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 .
Synthetic Cubism began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; ;
It was as though , in that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back -- or forward -- to literal three-dimensionality .
This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in general ) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane .
Some time in 1912 , Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar ; ;
However , the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever .
The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary .
Meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance .
The `` leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet blighted .
They are segregated businesses , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work force from segregated communities .
The suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened .
The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches .
To the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door .
If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program .
Today , according to land economist Homer Hoyt , shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46,000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's Central Business Districts put together .
Department stores were built on dry goods , especially ladies' fashions , and in this area , in the long run , the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown .

The open ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers .
He left at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle .
Then , advised by the Architect of the Capitol , the Joint Committee for the Library , traditionally responsible for the works of art in the building , ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco , to show `` the Peace after the Civil War '' , `` the Spanish-American War '' , and `` the Birth of Aviation '' , to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi's technique and composition .
Later the cleaning and restoration were ordered , first of the older part of the frieze , finally of the canopy .
What follows is therefore a description of three separate undertakings , the new frescoing of the gap , and the successive essays in conservation , with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each .
To be sure of matching color as well as form , pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast , and large samples painted in fresco , then left two months to dry out to their final key .
As it was , it took the pigment well for six hours , enough for our purpose , and held it firmly in setting .
For convenience we chose a stronger pigment , unknown to the early Italians or to Brumidi , titanium oxide , reserving the active lime white for highest lights , put on at the end of the day's stint .
Experience showed , however , that it is very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven .
One sees Costaggini's rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away .

I am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R. .

the aggressive disbelief of those who are romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word `` Revolution '' ; ;
Difficult as it may have been at times , Pozzatti and I saw enough , talked to enough artists , historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear .
It cannot be said that our very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one .
If we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement , our last day , to us at least , was equally impressive and very moving , even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence .
A chance remark about Lenin's sealed train brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to George Washington's cherry tree .
It was only after we had responded , with what I fear were similar cliches , that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the U.S. Government in Cuba and Laos .
This gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should not presume to lecture her on Abstraction .

Until our Moscow experience , I had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally .
`` We have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your ways .

While we , as American artists , believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity , we would be less than honest with you , or ourselves , if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole .
Such books are easy prey for critics .
It would be superfluous to build a critique around them .
It is worthwhile to recall that Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects .
Despite its rather long intellectual history , alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a verified theory .
Nor do I think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual .
Three examples follow .
in the second study , the percentages were 86 for professionals , 74 for managerial persons , 42 for commercial employees , 56 for skilled workers , and 48 for semi-skilled workers .
Or , he might remind Fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low : after all , the medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount ; ;
The ambiguities suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought .
He has his cake and eats it too : if the workers say they are dissatisfied , this shows conscious alienation ; ;
One can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear .
It omits , for example , practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English social critics , nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious , and all those who are with more or less accuracy called Existentialists .
Turning from these problems of the use of evidence , one meets another type of difficulty in Fromm's analysis , which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms .
The only other one I shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism .
Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris' first monologue , for example .
Their begging song might easily be a folk melody :
Rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock , a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it .
The effect is as if he had materialized out of nowhere .
He addresses Marina with great deference , calling her `` Princess '' at first ; ;
Another theme , sinuously chromatic , appears as he directs her to gain power over Grigori by any means , even at the cost of her honor .
Whatever the source of Rangoni's power , Marina is his captive now ; ;
The most unusual feature of Boris , however , is the use of the greatest character of all , the chorus .
And Mityukh , apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd , replies that he has no notion .
then the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before , ending it with a wail of despair .
The living as well as the dead now accuse him ; ;
In addition , it is an important link in the plot , giving us a revealing glimpse of the people's attitude toward Boris and the false Dimitri .
The mayhem in the forest of Kromy is a natural sequel .
The St. Basil's scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the square , the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny .
This is not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense .
Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ;
In the later poems , however , the personal tone predominates .
The bad early poems are bad Shakespeare or bad Swinburne ; ;
the bad late poems are bad Hardy .
The dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past productions for his various volumes , and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time .
The last three volumes are again more dependent on the past , as Hardy's creative powers declined in his old age .
The details of the setting of `` Neutral Tones '' are not , strictly speaking , metaphorical , but they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love , and in this way love and weather , the emotions and the elements , symbolize each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy's best poems ( `` Weathers '' , `` The Darkling Thrush '' , and `` During Wind and Rain '' , for example ) and to some moving passages in the novels as well ( Far From The Madding Crowd is full of scenes constructed in this way ) .
`` Neutral Tones '' is an excellent example of Hardy's mature style , drawn from his earliest productive period ; ;
I cite it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older ( as Yeats did ) , but that he simply learned to use better what he already had .
In the 1860 - 70 decade there are many poems like `` Revulsion '' , but there is only one `` Neutral Tones '' .
The `` Poems of 1912 - 13 '' offer a good example of Hardy's style as it was manifested in the later productive decade .
The view is always toward the past ; ;
Like the pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas .
If the word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves .
Both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art .
Living in San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue .
So as the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration .
The last time I saw Dylan , his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality .
They were both very fluent .
Art may have been for him the most enduring , orderly , and noble activity of man .
But the other activities of his life partook of these values .
Dylan Thomas's verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews .
The tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries .
It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry .
This is one difference between Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out .
A poem by Dylan Thomas , a saxophone solo by Charles Parker , a painting by Jackson Pollock -- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves .
Confabulation has come to determine structure .
Parker certainly had much more of an influence .
The main line of development today goes back to Lester Young and by-passes them .
A process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long .
So , in the last couple of years , abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion -- indications of landscape or living figures .
Anglo-Saxon and Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age .
Hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ;
the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus .
Assonance seems nearly as severe a curb , although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury declares that A Song Of Roland was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings .
The poet in a written tradition who generally never blots a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame .
The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings , which provided for the difficulties of alliteration ; ;
no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before Christ .
Yet , if the argument is turned awry , there may be found a great deal in Bryan's view , after all .
A ship at dry-dock could be called a foamy-necked floater in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship in Greek .
Beowulf and the Homeric poems appear oral compositions .
Carl Eduard Schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems , and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted 2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times .
This essay seeks to make that exploration .
He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response .
In Great Expectations the hands become almost an obsession .
Wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction by regularly rubbing his hands together .
We have only to think of Lady Macbeth or the policeman-murderer in Thomas Burke's famous story , `` The Hands Of Mr. Ottermole '' , to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment .
The novel opens with a fugitive convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being `` laid hands on '' -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard `` as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people , stretching up cautiously out of their graves , to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in '' .
Magwitch terrifies Pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a bogy man who may `` softly creep his way to him and tear him open '' , `` imbruing his hands '' in him .
Pip imagines how Estella would look down upon Joe's hands , roughened by work in the smithy , and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which Pip struggles -- idleness and work , artificiality and naturalness , gentility and commonness , coldness and affection -- in fact , between Satis House and the forge .
We take leave of Pumblechook as he gloats over Pip's loss of fortune , extending his hand `` with a magnificently forgiving air '' and exhibiting `` the same fat five fingers '' , one of which he identifies with `` the finger of Providence '' and shakes at Pip in a canting imputation of the latter's `` ingratitoode '' and his own generosity as Pip's `` earliest benefactor '' .
Pip first learns `` the stupendous power of money '' from the sycophantic tailor , Mr. Trabb , whose brutality to his boy helper exactly matches the financial resource of each new customer , and whose fawning hands touch `` the outside of each elbow '' and `` rub '' Pip out of the shop .

Reservation of index words and electronic switches
The assignment of actual addresses to symbolic index word and electronic switch names occurs in Phase 3 , of the Autocoder processor .
Both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable before the start of assignment in one of the following ways .
The initial setting of the availability table indicated that the index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment .
The one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an EQU statement , e.g. ,
any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass .
the third applies only to index words .
Declarative statements are never executed in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area , placed preferably at its beginning or end .
Since the 7070 and 7074 make use of record definition words ( RDWS ) to read , write , move , and otherwise examine blocks of storage , the DA and DC statements provide the option of generating RDWS automatically .
The area may include constant information supplied by the programmer .
A DUF entry must be supplied for every unit record file describing the type of file and the unit record equipment to be used .
Brief descriptions of these three declarative statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions of each of the other 7070/7074 Autocoder declarative statements follow below .
This item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 - 94 .
If the second item in the operand is omitted , the symbolic name IOCSIXG will be assigned .
O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes .
It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development .
The pilot plant was a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom , 4 ft below the surface , with a volume of 121,000 Aj .
The pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area .
Examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the 6-hr. composite samples with 24-hr. operations .
Pilot plant operations
The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 mg/l with an average of 350 Aj .
Ice caused the aerator to overload , straining the drive belts .
The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage .
The BOD in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 Aj .
The floc particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out .
A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate .
The BOD data are given in Table 4 .
Thus , the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping , defense of naval forces , and area defense .
intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augmented program in oceanography .
These have sought more and more of what they have .
This , despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting .
Now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily .
While one element is announcing progress , another is delineating its problems .
Industry's main criticism of the Navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how .
The result , coupled with the salesmanship for which American industry is famous , is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas .
Russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world , divided between her various fleets .
Attack can come from almost any direction against many locations .
It is a war of attrition , of single actions , of an exchange of losses .
Some limitations of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another .
Therefore , the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements .
But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically .
These can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence .
The ocean presently co-operates with the target .
Gathering intelligence is important , but of equal importance is its translation into usable form .
There may be others .
They are still considered to be for use in restricted waters , however , and targets must come within a few yards of them .

It was possible , however , to decompose the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two viscoelastic mechanisms , each compatible with the Boltzmann superposition principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence factors .
Most of the impact energy is spent in crushing and fragmentation .
By applying this general principle , a great number of complex compounds of osmium , ruthenium , iridium , and rhenium , with triphenylphosphine , triphenylarsine , and triphenylstibine have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years .
( Lauri Vaska , E. M. Sloane , J. W. DiLuzio ) In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary , decomposition of solvent alcohol and coordination of its fragments to the metal were not considered , following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in preparative coordination chemistry .
During the past year , these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes of nickel ( 2 ) and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged complexes of palladium ( 2 ) ( see figure ) , as well as new compounds of the well-known type Af .
The various stress-temperature coefficients for constancy of volume and strain , constancy of pressure and strain , and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated .
-- Recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions of polymeric chains by Volkenstein and Lifson has been extended to include more general types of chains .
-- The crystallization of copolymers comprising Af units interspersed with a minor percentage of Af is limited by the inability of the crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky side group of the latter .
Experiments carried out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of several degrees Centigrade and to a concentration range of only several per cent .
The contraction therefore partakes of the character of a phase transition .

Because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing .
Interest remained , however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing , or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations .
Enzymatic action in stored food produces changes which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability .
Radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food .
Of the potentially useful sources of ionizing radiations , gamma sources , cobalt-60 , cesium-137 , fission products , or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems .
Conventional energy for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per kwhr for process steam .
No comparable reductions in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen .
They require completely sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration , preferably items already cooked and ready to eat .
Off-flavor is a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meats , but problems of commercial acceptability remain .
A refrigerated item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type .
Competitive processes for preserving meats are by canning and freezing .
Radiosterilization ( at 3 Mrad ) is more expensive than canning , particularly for the cesium-137 source .

The instrument is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating .
It should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness .
Why should the `` practical adhesion '' of a coating as assessed by a knife method change , initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness ? ?
The details of the removal process are shown schematically in Fig. 6 .
Af is the shear force along the shear plane ; ;
Af is the normal compressive force acting on the shear plane ; ;
**yf is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate ; ;
Af is instrumentally determined .
However , in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn. ( 1 ) .
In extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even change during the course of a measurement .
The resultant friction force , Af is thus directly proportional to Af and consequently also to film thickness .
This is shown in the photomicrograph of Fig. 8 .
With increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases .
Eventually , rupture occurs along the shear plane ( 9e ) , and the cycle repeats itself .
Under equilibrium cutting conditions , the chip exerts a force Af against the coating and an equal opposite force Af against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in Fig. 6 .
Within only a few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight .
Yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb. by 1964 .
And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated .
another reports that a cellular polypropylene , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated .
In one outstanding example , Whirlpool Corp. found that by switching to urethane foam insulation , they could increase the storage capacity of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models .
And in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment interlining , new adhesives and new methods of laminating foam to a substrate have been developed .
Urethane foams
Present estimates are that production topped the 100-million-lb. mark in 1960 ( 85 to 90 million lb. for flexible , 10 or 11 million lb. for rigid ) ; ;
The markets that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations .
In one-shot , the isocyanate , polyester or polyether resin , catalyst , and other additives are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately .
The single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example .
Flexural strength :
This property refers to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart .
There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane product .
Basically , the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units , a variable mixer , a nozzle carriage assembly , and , in many cases , a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidifies into foam .
Also available is a slitter which `` peels '' the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd. in length , down to 1/16 in. thick .
The closed molding of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction of the material ( molding in open molds was more feasible ) .
The introduction of one-shot polyether foam systems , aided by the development of new catalysts , helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding .
This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes .
By this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages , first by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water , since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly to waste from the suds box drains .
Distances marked on the specimen in warp and filling directions ( or wales and courses for knitted fabrics ) are measured before and after laundering .
One fin is located every 120-degrees around the inside diameter of the wheel .
Dryer -- dryer of the rotary tumble type , having a cylindrical basket approximately 30 inches in diameter and 24 inches in length and rotating at approximately 35 r.p.m. .
tension presser -- consisting of a padded ironing board from which extend clamping members on all four sides .
A perforated aluminum plate , used to provide the drying surface , is heated by means of a flatiron .
Therefore , it is recommended that in such cases the sample be replaced , or if used , the results of dimensional change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative only .
The marked distances are parallel to the respective yarns .
Distances of less than 10 inches are not recommended .
Procedure
Again stop the machine at the end of the time shown in Column C of Table 2 .
Tests 2 , 3 , , , and 4 .
Immediately refill to a level of Af inches with water at 100 - 109-degrees-F ( 38 - 43*0C ) .
High-gain , photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability .
Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C )
Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope .
Furthermore , the thin film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be tolerated .
The magnification may be smaller , equal , or larger than unity .
The luminous efficiency and resolution of single stages , fiber couplers , and finally of the composite tube will be computed .
Basic design of a fiber-coupled , double-stage image intensifier
The anode potential codetermines the gain , G , and magnification , M , of the stage .
As it will be shown later , the field-flattening properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design .
The second photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates .
Both stages are assumed to have unity magnification .
Settled phosphors , as generally used in image intensifiers , have low optical contact with the substrate surface , hence Af shall be assumed .
A sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses R can be obtained from the angle independent Fresnel formula : Af .
For phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces , and assuming Af , we obtain Af percent .
The packing efficiency , F.R. , of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature , probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used , until rather recently .
In general , a high anode voltage reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution .
( The P-20 input is of interest because it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray fluorescent screens ) .
A resolution of 70 - 80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible .
Thus , in general , elementary light optical effects , light scatter , and electron scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit .
For the further discussion , we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 Af and phosphor screen resolution of 60 Af .
For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream .
To proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for interpolation ; ;
But even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and R stages .
The principle of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process .
This will result in a value Af of the objective function , and when Af is chosen correctly this will give Af , the maximum of the objective function .
In finding the optimal R-stage policy from that of Af stages , only the function Af is needed .
We cannot now speak of maximizing the value of the objective function , since this function is now known only in a probabilistic sense .
If we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next , then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first .
In many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages , since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process .
The platform is initially off level by the angle Aj .
There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts , engine noise , turbulence around the vehicle , etc. .
Below this level , the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value , in order to provide adequate noise filtering .
This process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random .
7-4 .
For purely inertial navigators , two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading : Use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading ; ;
The choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements , field conditions , and the time available to accomplish the heading .
This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques .
However , this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work .
7-6 .
The input axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers .
When the platform is level , **ye is a rotation about the Z axis of the platform Af .
He looked at his son , his face worried .
Scotty murmured , `` No , thanks '' , so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him .
`` He's all right , Craig '' , Rachel said .
Since his seizure , Scotty had had little appetite ; ;
yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , was one of plumpness .
his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking .
His hands , which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed .
They did not speak much .
It was a Negro section of peeling row houses , store-front churches and ragged children .
Virginia treated him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuits , cookies , candies -- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen .
his mouth hung slightly open .
When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; ;
He was calm , drugged , and lazy .
She was with Elizabeth .
The doctor had to bend close to hear ; ;
Scotty said the same words more loudly .
He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown .
He felt her irritability did not concern him , yet he knew he would not care even if it did .
Miss Estherson called twice .
Scotty shrugged slightly .
Rachel's tone was dry .
`` She didn't really say '' -- She glanced away at the floor , then swooped gracefully and picked up one of Scotty's slippers .
This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead .
`` Is his appetite improved '' ? ?
Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat .
`` I'm eating more '' , he would say .
`` I'm not supposed to yet '' .
Where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves upward in angry motion , Papa-san sat glacier-like , his smooth solidity , his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him .
`` Our objective '' , the colonel had said that day of the briefing , `` is Papa-san '' .
The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion .
Closer still , regular barricades of barbed wire hung on timber supports .
Who would clean up the mess when the war was over ? ?
If he were to go with White , he would be out there two days , not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san , but moving ever deeper into enemy land -- behind Papa-san -- itself .
There was just too much time .
He saw no life , but still stood there for a time peering at the unlovely hills , his gaze continually returning to Papa-san .
Yet , he was here .
Warren and White each carried , in addition to their own weapons and ammo , a box of ammo for the ROK's machine gun .
Others carried extra clips for the Browning Automatic Rifle , which was in the hands of a little Mexican named Martinez .
Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon .
`` We just sit quiet and wait '' , Prevot had said .
`` Be sure the man nearest you is awake .
Then we pull out under our mortar and artillery cover , but nobody pulls out until I say so .
Mines .
Big ones and little .
Prevot had said that the searchlights would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours , `` which gives us time to get settled in position '' .
Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew .
Even so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; ;
-- In France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger to their exultation .
Wait '' ! !
It will be good for you .
He smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that might help .
The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers .
the distant ship isn't there until you get the focus .
You know what I'm talking about .
Mr. Christiansen knows that a soldier will get the Distinguished Service Medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian .
It was left out of him at birth .
Jane nodded with a pleasant smile .
The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out , and I suggested , ' You ask for volunteers , and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky , ten dollars and a week-end pass to Davao .
There was a lot of shooting .
When he was in the war , he was in Law or Supplies or something like that , and an old buddy of his told me he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon and read the citations for medals -- just like the one we sent in for Trig -- and go away with a real glow .
These were heroes nine feet tall to him '' .
He thought how this dainty , fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of Westminster on a day in June , enjoying the flowers in the shops , the greetings from old friends , but never really drawing a deep , passionate breath , was so like himself .
And so he had , so he had .
The only one who would have him was his cripple , the strange unhappy woman who became his wife .
He had dared to defy nature , to turn his back to the Lorelei , and he was punished .
He did not like Boxell .
he had to find out .
Boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously .
Where will you break ? ?
This is why I say we just can't go ahead and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses .
Let me tell you what happened to me today .
A fellow came up to me , a Senator , I don't have to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the President like a brother , but God damn it , he's crucifying me .
Annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa River , a small and dirty stream .
the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were .
It was an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair .
A knot of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon .
During the next weeks he looked over the situation .
The church itself must be repaired .
There were two liquor saloons not very far from the church , one white , that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for Negroes ; ;
Undoubtedly , there was a good deal of gambling in both .
On the other side of the church was a quiet , well-kept house with shutters and recently painted .
Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people , which seemed to him rather queer .
The best could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better .
And Wilson tried .
The bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears , and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in , and that none would be sold to colored folk .
It had been here fifty years .
It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject .
`` Reverend '' , he said , `` I think you don't quite understand the situation here .
When a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them .
Then Wilson asked , `` What about this Kent House which you mention ? ?
`` My dear , you must be mistaken '' .
It was still Good Friday , after all .
In the half darkness the banisters gleamed , and the hall seemed enormous .
It was a thrill he felt no part in .
He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs .
Panting a little , Payne shook his head .
Dr. Verdi had told him to deliver his package in person .
`` Very well '' , Payne said .
Only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle over it for days , whereas at the time it had seemed quite real .
From childhood he had known all about knives .
It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams .
He was only dreaming .
He felt curiously sleepy , the world seemed far away ; ;
Laura Keene had been in the green room .
She had been one of the first to collect her wits .
Guns were going off all over Washington City these days , because of the celebrations , and the theatre was not soundproof .
Then the audience saw a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box .
Harry Hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings .
The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The Octoroon .
Laura Keene brushed by him with the glass of water .
The beehive voices , for no one could bear silence , drowned out the sound of Mrs. Lincoln's weeping .
At the rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor .
Rathbone said he was bleeding to death .
Katie reared a third time , then , trembling , descended .
Only the top of the head , with a spot bare and white as a clamshell , remained visible .
A train hooted .
They were pursuing him .
The walls bulged , the floor trembled , the windowpanes rattled .
Bong ! !
Six o'clock ! !
`` I know , Stephen '' , she smiled .
He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square .
Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown , beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine shop , and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal , and northward to Brooklyn , below Point Peter , he could see the church spire wherever he looked back .
that was Pennsylvania .
South of Laurel Grove Cemetery , and below the junction of the Neversink and the Delaware , was the Tri-State Rock , from which Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania , as well as New York , simply by spinning around on his heel .
Ludie inquired every evening , pretending that he did not care .
`` Will he die '' ? ?
To speak of Papa dying was a sin .
The mouth was thin-lipped and wide , the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide .
When Papa's slender fingers removed the spectacles , there were red indentations on the bridge of the strong nose .
He strove to think of God and His eternal wrath ; ;
if he missed it , never again .
What if it came when he was playing , or was asleep and dreaming ? ?
Aggie might fly into a closet , shut the door and bury her head in the clothes ; ;
But he was good .
Lightning might strike the steeples of the other churches ; ;
He ran out into the downpour , sped across the yard and into the buggy room .
`` Don't be afraid , Violet '' ! !
If there was a fire or a flood he would save Mama first and Violet next .
Even before the benches had dried , the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their places .
`` Go on home '' ! !
Ludie screeched at him .
Ludie had a cigar box full of marbles and shooters , and a Roman candle from last Fourth of July .
Stevie envied him .
Fresh , warm , sweet and juicy , sweet lovin sixteen , she was .
The snow again .
Normal , by God .
Maybe they'll stop it now , once for all .
Clean the place up .
There was something troubling him though : as yet they hadn't Five days .
Months .
He saw himself before them delivering the speech .
He felt intense satisfaction .
But the words were forming .
He was trembling , a strange feeling upon him , fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot .
Stroked him , snaked all through him , the lyrics lifted him , took him from one magic isle to another , stopping briefly at each Brandon .
He is good .
But a nigger .
He was the guy what always goofed at Question Time .
Why couldn't they have dumped him off on someone else ? ?
Most on the ball .
Knows the score With a supreme effort , he broke it off .
The snow was tumbling down furiously now .
The whole fucken sky's cavin in ! !
He was again tingling with pleasure , seeing himself clearly in Slater's shoes .
It was nothing , though his heart was thumping wildly .
`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin , testily , eyeing him up and down .
`` Lookit that come down , willya '' , said the man , scratching himself , yawning .
Goddamn it .
Keep the chatter to a minimum , short answers , one word , if possible .
That's Brown's trouble .
Just about to get their asses kicked into hut Seven .
He watched the snow once again .
It made no sense to him .
Finnegan woke up .
What the hell was he up to now ? ?
Am I dreamin ? ?
''
Did I start the damn war ? ?
Goddamn .
He rolled over and tried to shut out the noise , now much louder .
A river , wide as the Missouri , where it ran by his place .
So what ? ?
Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him .
Immediately after dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor .
How cruel ! !
This time as a musician .
But then , after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited .
Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite , standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance .
A contradiction ? ?
No one will even suspect that it is your work '' .
To that Rousseau could agree .
`` What was your answer '' ? ?
How infuriating all this was ! !
Now , when everything was opening up to him -- even the court of Louis 15 ! !
And listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer .
`` You can't go in that way '' ! !
`` Who is going to stop me '' ? ?
`` Is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face ? ?
A hundred years ago I would have worn a beard with pride .
And those without beards would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion .
And fashion is the real king here .
He trembled lest his piece should fail .
By God , they're a-coming , they are '' ! !
The gun would fire or not , just as chance willed .
but when he passed us by , a musket roared , and he reared his horse , swung it around , and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come .
I must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; ;
Rank after rank of them came down the road , and the faces were all the same , and they walked in a sea of dust .
Hold your fire '' ! !
the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks , and during the next second or two , we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers .
but I have no memory of that .
Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ;
While this was being discussed , we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road .
That settled it , and we broke into parties of two and three .
Cousin Simmons roared .
That summer the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre Ameaux , a gaming-card manufacturer .
The Bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied .
But the thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him .
`` I have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur Favre said rudely .
I say to you that the Church will ever decry evil '' ! !
Ablard Corne , a short man with a rotunda of stomach , rose .
Abel Poupin , a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes , got to his feet .
`` Do not listen to that Frenchman .
He is throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win '' ! !
The canons , in a body , had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last rites of the Church , but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith .
The Abbot of St. Eloi , Claude De Mommor , had been a good friend , but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in hallowed ground .
she , too , prayed only to God .
A carriage crunched by , its dim lights filtering through the gloom .
He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes .
Below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; ;
`` How long , my Lord ? ?
How long ? ?
Indigestion plagued him .
Why , oh why , doesn't he stick to preaching the Gospel , instead of meddling in civic affairs , politics , economics , and social issues that are no concern of the Church '' ? ?
Tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight .
Monsieur Favre's threat would become a reality , for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that Frenchman '' .
The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie .
Faint at first , the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind .
Slowly , like a man grown old , he took Eli's hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned .
`` Plot '' ? ?
You know the law : if you lose the debate after accepting a challenge , you will be banished '' ! !
`` You are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal '' .
Anger and fear fused in John .
`` It was always the spirit with Christ ; ;
matters such as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential .
The chinless Jake called .
Somebody heaved a stone .
`` We have taught him a lesson '' .
At once a bevy of dogs was snapping and snarling around him .
There was , of course , no real need to rearrange everything .
The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street .
The men were huddled in those lairs .
His heart suddenly opened to joy .
Into the emptiness of the street , and his spirit , moved a form .
The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle .
He felt trapped in that pattern , in the repetition .
`` Oh , what's the matter with me '' ? ?
That other Jew , a young man too , had left that greatcoat behind , in a rich house , and marched away .
He had died there .
He is going to let History take the blame for a while '' .
He saw Mose squatting by the hearth , breaking up hardtack into a pan .
`` Chicken '' , Mose said , and theatrically licked his lips .
Then : `` yeah .
`` Fooled you , huh ? ?
It is the same ole same , tell me its name .
He dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boiling pot of lobscouse .
`` Good ole lob-scuse '' , he mumbled , and stirred the pot .
In a few minutes she was making the ten-foot hike unaided ; ;
Some liar's logic , a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the window ( a euphoria perhaps engendered by the pill Fritzie had given her ) , consoled her for a moment .
`` 'nother minute I'd have been fine .
H'all should have let me do it '' .
The heat intensified on Tuesday .
The maid was very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique uniform .
During the night , a phone company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones .
We can expect more of the same .
Amy still missing .
Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors .
The master of the house , his nourished face unrevealing , consented to postpone his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective .
a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; ;
then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor .
By comparison , Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering fledglings .
The dog refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers .
`` Scared the hell out of him '' , Kahler grinned .
In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen .
`` Le petit dejeuner '' , Harold said , in an accent that did credit to Miss Sloan , his high-school French teacher .
Eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water .
They assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained .
The telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall .
Between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub .
`` Sabine called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said .
He handed Harold a key to the front door , and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment .
Matching photographs in oval frames of Mme Bonenfant and an elderly man who must be Alix's grandfather .
Mme Vienot , considerably younger and very different .
The apex , the study where Eugene slept , was light and bright and airy and cheerful .
Beethoven's Fifth was the one on top .
Da-da-da-dum Music could not be Eugene's passion .
The clock on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room .
Her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building , and her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture -- a big , round , oak dining table and chairs , a buffet , with a row of unclaimed letters inserted between the mirror and its frame .
Rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered , they had gone sight-seeing .
Instead , they went on down the hall to their room .
`` Do you think he could be having an affair '' ? ?
`` Oh no '' , Harold said , shocked .
He's probably spending the evening with friends '' .
They could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days .
He reached out and felt the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub .
`` What is it '' ? ?
`` I've solved the mystery of the little bag .
`` There's a big boat anchored near the Place De La Concorde , with a swimming pool in it -- didn't you notice it ? ?
Also , he was so nice when he was nice '' .
`` I don't think it was that , really '' .
Perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate's asking for Christ's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone home to mourn .
They would feel what Mary was undergoing .
He improvised as he went along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud .
That is why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture '' .
`` Not at all .
`` I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble .
Not bulky laborers , but sinewy men .
Rabbi Melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes .
Jacopo Galli introduced him into several Roman homes .
but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes .
He was able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes .
When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy ; ;
Drawing and models were his thinking .
`` And God help anyone who tries to unteach you '' ! !
Though the pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned .
She held Jonathan's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed .
Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own .
She was taken up in worry for the reckless old man .
She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom .
Whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day .
At the landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door .
I am to go to Washington to serve with him '' .
Then she took iced lemonade to Marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden .
When Marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue , Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry .
`` He wants me to go with him tomorrow '' , she told Kate .
I have held your papers of manumission since I married Mr. Lattimer '' .
She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it .
He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on .
Strange how everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long .
Mynheer , Sir Francis , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road .
David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet .
Its groin was bloody .
New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island .
These were the ships of His Majesty's Navy , herding the hulks of the East Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists .
Along Wappinger Creek in Dutchess County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck's Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen .
The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight .
David Cortlandt , having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil .
He looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked out at King's Bridge toward Westchester .
The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston .
He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept .
Orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government .
He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost .
He hoped he was free of self-deception .
David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface .
He knew that many were using it for their own ends .
war was a smugglers' heaven .
One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing .
Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows .
It is harder , he muttered , to meditate on man ( or woman ) than on God .
he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much .
A man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days .
He wondered how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish .
Andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference .
`` I do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism .
Beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea .
This is our singular goal .
This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism .
Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex , `` I only want to be a Pole .
He ground his teeth together .
I hate Warsaw , he said to himself .
All of Poland is a coffin .
Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .
Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into Lublin's web .
`` Captain Androfski '' ! !
His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby .
Nothing like the old days in the army , but I get by .
Who complains ? ?
Many times I tried to reach you , but I never knew how .
I came to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall ''
`` Were you able to make the arrangements '' ? ?
Why do we let the Germans do this '' ? ?
It was an answer that Styka understood .
He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch .
He grunted a sort of `` yes '' answer .
It will take a few days .
`` We get strange orders '' .
I'd have been more impressed if I hadn't remembered that she'd played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course .
We moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill .
She just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't let me go .
After all I'm made of flesh and blood .
There was somebody else in the apartment .
Oval face without an expression in the world .
Imagine that .
I must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times .
I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship .
Now and then he would disappear for several days .
He was a big thick beefy violent man .
`` Whom God hath joined '' etcetera .
Pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost her job on that fashion magazine .
All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion .
My first thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd been living together six weeks .
The portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves .
Sposato couldn't wait to get me hired .
The things a man will do for a woman .
He left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions .
he was to try to make no converts ; ;
he was simply to listen and report back what he heard .
He had already been studying the Bible ; ;
Rector had never been able to find out much about Hino's past .
Putting the pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography .
Rector was often curious ; ;
`` All right '' , Rector said .
He had something more to say .
Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission .
Rector asked him to move it for the time being ; ;
Rector said .
Rector's next stop was at the schoolroom , where Mavis was monitoring a test .
`` How many children do you have present today '' ? ?
`` Fifteen '' , she said .
'' `` Fine '' , Rector said .
`` You are about to become a first-class surveyor '' , Rector said .
He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall , and then to take charge of the office while the party was here .
The air was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant .
Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose .
She concluded by asking for a brief interview -- `` to settle with you where '' -- and she threw in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance '' .
And he would see her that evening .
Victory at last ! !
`` Your voice is delightful '' , he approved with a warm smile .
A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden .
Alone with the fabulous Byron ! !
To be passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd .
`` We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but I promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again '' .
`` The gods seemed to think sex pretty important '' , she rebutted .
`` So you know something of the classics , do you '' ? ?
I don't ask you who 'tis you're being unfaithful to , husband or lover .
The light supper over , Claire went to him and , slipping an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee .
The bodice beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child .
By odd coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet's successes .
`` If he would only leave the East '' , said Mary .
Demanded Mary .
Chapter 9
`` A public of one '' , Mary echoed reprovingly .
The lordly poet was at low-water mark .
The careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent .
Now , under the impact of his wife's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be .
-- Sir ? ?
I want to take a look .
Someone had hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed .
The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy .
Watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later .
Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form .
His lack of success steadily eroded his interest .
For what ? ?
-- Let's get out of here .
Watson stared at them curiously .
Behind them shambled a long column of weak , tattered men .
Four men were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise .
In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff .
The third crawling man forced himself erect .
He swayed like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles .
His steps were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a supercilious strut .
The guards did not look at him .
Then he began to crawl again .
He felt a spectator interest .
Say three minutes to make it sporting .
He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart .
-- Let me help him , for the love of God ! !
But you ain't Henry .
-- You talk deep .
Can you walk ? ?
-- Why , course I can .
I can walk real good .
He was no heavier than a child .
Watson spat on the ground .
As I say , I wouldn't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done .
It was built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property .
She was a pale woman .
The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year's lights .
Mrs. Pastern had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts .
Mrs. Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat .
She stopped at the Surcliffes' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda .
She took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door .
Travelling home on a late train ? ?
`` I'll have a drink , then , if you'll have one with me '' .
She didn't like to travel .
she had made no friends .
''
And knowing its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness ? ?
The remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there .
Charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the TV room to hear the news .
He shouted .
But in bed he had trouble sleeping .
In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .
During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga .
There she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark .
To Mark : `` Please give my regards to Myra '' .
Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water .
I hope Raphael bought them whole '' .
Angelina stepped back , her eyes roaming the tray for omissions .
I used to play with the older one sometimes , when he'd let me .
Abel '' ? ?
And indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth .
In the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her .
It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea .
And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself .
There was stability there , too -- a color which his life had had once .
Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness .
Mark held the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in the years to come .
He smiled .
There was the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air .
The Starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay .
Mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars .
I pushed at his shoulder , calling his name .
He was a cagey sonofabitch .
`` A fat hell on Big Hans .
The kid '' .
`` Nothing to steal from the crib '' .
The kid '' --
You know I don't want to see Pedersen .
God dammit , get .
He didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa's door down before he stopped .
He might not have gone that far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house .
Pa's scared to hell of axes '' .
You want the kid to die ? ?
`` Pa don't care about the kid '' .
The first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew .
He was awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasn't thinking about that at all , not anything like that .
He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it .
`` No '' .
He's got to thaw slow .
`` Here , help me prop him up .
`` Lift , don't shove lift '' .
His head flopped back .
His mouth fell open .
The skin on his neck was tight .
He was cold all right .
He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values .
he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday's Herald Tribune and yesterday's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop .
Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .
There are , after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man .
To the stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed .
Then , when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window .
Every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers .
Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes .
So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes .
She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this .
When they first married he had been working in the fields all day , and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal .
There was no reason for her to ask what they did .
So the pattern was established .
There was not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be .
The women and children stayed at the Albrights' .
Off and on , all day , someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything .
The dust clogged their throats , and the heat parched them , so that the women were always making ice water .
There was much embracing , much exclaiming .
All the women got up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations .
We came on as soon as we could '' .
`` Oh he's a second cousin or something .
Thirty-five , I guess .
Bobby Joe took a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` Bye now '' was gone for the day .
`` I'd give anything if I could have found a girl like you '' .
Of course he couldn't say much , really , because of Debora , but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got .
She exclaimed .
It was full-of-the-moon ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day .
`` But tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching '' ? ?
It was the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste .
The market was not far and , once there , the doctor's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him .
and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast .
The doctor , he noticed , was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well .
`` Comment '' ? ?
Ejaculated the surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , parting from her without ceremony , only offered a few words about the doctor's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work .
Time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature .
Startled , he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went to the door .
It was Giselle , the fille de chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird .
Anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room '' .
A guest was locking his room ; ;
They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe ; ;
At the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning .
Seems like she's willing , but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the barn and then didn't know what to do , and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble .
`` If I catch you one more time down here without stockings '' --
Winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron .
Carefully , he undid the bow .
`` I thought you was sick to death of this big house .
We've only been married four years , January '' .
Although it had seemed a good reason , to begin with : no couple could afford to have children .
She was too young , that was all ; ;
he wore his clothes with style .
At home , he wouldn't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys .
`` Good-by , Winston '' , Mr. Jack said , giving a final set to his hat .
`` Look out for those movers '' ! !
Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car ; ;
He knew the house like a blind man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up .
Somehow Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes .
In the living room , Miss Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand .
she had on her Easter suit , blue , with lavender binding .
The china lemon tree .
`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? ?
Winston folded the tissue paper carefully .
Winston was relieved ; ;
He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack .
On Christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it .
Through the door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada .
She had asked .
`` You look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr. Jack had started .
Make the man put them in if he has to '' .
My parents' welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted .
But that year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond .
'' and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , , and news of her commencing again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe .
In my letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life .
The night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle -- it must have been late in September -- I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and blooded , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life .
As it turned out , Jessica took matters into her own hands .
The kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting premonitions of lust , all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me .
But though I boasted and gave off a dapper front , I was beneath it all frightened .
At five o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom .
I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil's ears .
I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind , felt older than my years , and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of Manhattan .
I looked over their faces and felt a twinge : they all looked so much more knowing than I .
Suppose I hadn't brought along enough money ? ?
Don't tell me about drunks .
`` Would it make any difference to you if I were , Mary Jane '' ? ?
I'm interested in every patient I've helped take care of .
`` You are young , intelligent , have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself , but you mess it up with whiskey , indifference , self-destructive attitudes .
We keep getting the same ones back again and again .
I wanted to go to college , too '' --
`` Chicago has some of the best '' --
`` My aunt raised me .
We've always been so close '' .
It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary Jane Brennan should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused , sick , irresponsible person she believed me to be .
I knew that .
As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking over the events of the past two weeks , trying to put the pieces in order .
I had been among the top third in my class at N.Y.U. , had wanted desperately to go to medical school , but I'd run out of money and energy at the same time .
`` I beg your pardon , sir '' ? ?
I'm calling you , Mr. Nelson , at the request of Mr. Phillip Wycoff .
His car could pick you up at your hotel at twelve '' .
`` Yes , of course , Mr. Nelson '' .
I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round .
`` I haven't made up my mind yet '' , I said .
I have a couple of them I'm figuring on ; ;
`` I'll have one of the boys get it '' , he said .
Regulars drive out their own cars '' .
I turned on the electric bug , and the signal came in loud and clear .
I made time and picked him up within ten blocks .
If it ever got behind me , the beep turned to a buzz .
By this time it was dark .
Moreover , I'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic shadowing device .
`` I don't think so '' .
`` Not to you '' , she said smiling .
There are ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office .
The construction was reasonably solid ; ;
Whoever his companion was going to be , she was going to join him later .
She knew where to come .
The powerful microphone I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation , and I was positively nauseated I was so hungry .
I didn't turn it off '' .
She went in to get the hamburgers , and I switched on the device again and kept the signal from Dowling's car coming in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the hamburgers .
Then I shut off the device again .
`` Don't you think it's selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up '' ? ?
You see , she's on a diet .
`` How much overweight is she '' ? ?
She looked at me provocatively .
The fat man said , `` All we gotta do is go around the corner '' .
`` Canada doesn't have much of this here juvenile delinquency problem , but we keep a night policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists '' .
She measured the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun , measured the distance from the men to the back room .
He turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant .
You ain't kidding me -- the kid don't know the name of this town '' ? ?
She musta been walking in her sleep -- you seen her yourself in here '' .
`` Howda I know '' ? ?
She was just waking up when we found her at the garage '' .
Vince swore .
`` Why does everything have to happen to me '' ? ?
Vince watched him .
`` Why can't I leave her locked up in the tool crib '' ? ?
In the tool crib she can't get away '' .
`` Are you a poor dumb Canadian or a smart aleck from the States '' ? ?
Vince lifted his hand as if to strike , but his thin lips spread in a smile .
Was it because she had shown panic ? ?
She called softly , `` Barney '' .
I could send the money right back '' .
How could he be kind one moment and cruel the next ? ?
Something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists .
Lauren Landis was in trouble and she was alone .
Dave made some sound meant to convey agreement .
He inserted the car key in the lock .
She stammered , `` You heard what he said about police ? ?
He said , `` I'm not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those '' --
As he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath , Marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey .
Squire chewed his gum , his jaw moving in a steady rhythm .
`` I see there are some cars here .
I wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town ? ?
There was no word spoken , no apparent signal given .
Marty Land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously in the sky again .
From a great distance thunder growled and broke the silence .
Land looked back toward the dilapidated house .
He thought he saw a pale face at a window .
Perhaps it was Dora May .
There was another on this side , a little further down .
There was nothing he could do but walk .
Perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town .
A foolish thought came into his head .
He could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch .
He jumped , and sank to his knees in muddy water .
He did not dare climb back up to the road .
The Plymouth was coming at him from the east , the pickup truck from the west .
They had timed it better this time .
He held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible .
The weird , insane sound of the Rebel yell reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills .
He was nearing the Admassy house .
And then he heard a car coming from the east , and he felt as if he would break down and weep .
`` Oh , no , not again '' , he said aloud .
It was Pete Holmes , the cabdriver .
If I'd stayed , all that I'd have got was four punctured tires and one busted head .
Why didn't you wait at the Burch house ? ?
The sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space .
Rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up .
`` Where '' ? ?
Rourke hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes .
`` I want to be in Scotty's Bar at midnight when Marsha makes her phone call there '' , he ended grimly .
I think her husband strongly suspects so , and that's why he called me in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so .
Isn't this Felice's street '' ? ?
Rourke could see it better out the right-hand side , and he said , `` yes .
Turn to the left , I think , for that number you gave me .
Those names mean anything to you '' ? ?
Shayne nodded grimly .
On Felice Perrin .
Make them show their hands .
Timothy Rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel .
''
Shayne chuckled .
He was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when Rourke came in six or eight minutes later .
Harris and Geely .
Just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street , and they better send a patrol car .
Will that pay for a pint I can take with me .
`` Candy is dandy , but liquor is quicker and you don't have any candy for sale here anyhow '' .
The bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill .
Outside , Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south .
Shayne locked his big hands around Harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway .
He turned , then , to look toward the lighted Boulevard , and saw Rourke's tall , emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side .
They went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling .
A row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them .
He rose stiffly , forcing his knees to lock .
He held the razor well out to one side .
They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step .
Mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door .
Then Roberts was on him , gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade .
Still clutching the razor , Roberts came up into a crouch , shaking his head .
They would have to .
By then they could never catch up with the others .
There's no other way ; ;
It took him nearly an hour .
He went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat .
He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby .
The body was heavier than he had anticipated .
The Jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground .
Inside the passage , he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden .
By the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight .
It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off .
He had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket .
In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it .
On the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over Lake Pontchartrain and along the coast .
The courthouse was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome .
`` So you're looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned .
She's the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday paper and all that '' .
It took a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted .
I can look it up .
Do they still live here '' ? ?
I'm sure it'll be in the files .
Wants to look up something in the newspaper files , so don't lock him in here '' .
`` Sure '' , said Hirey .
It latches when you close it , so stay as long as you like '' .
`` Now don't shut this door .
He tried to turn right to the society page in each one , but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him .
In the middle of the stock market crash , he heard a slight noise in the outer office .
Something else distracted him , yet there was no sound , only tomblike silence .
He jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing .
Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here , had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted .
No , they could kill him just as easy right now .
It must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors' office .
Gaylor's obsession and Cunningham's chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking of Lila and Lilac , separately or together , as a legend .
`` I take a little time to think it over '' .
`` Not too much time , because I'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away .
And I done favors for you , big favor not so long back , didn't I , and I'm right here to take on where Pretty left off .
Acourse there's this deal o' Denny's -- and Jackie's -- kinda hangin' fire , ain't it , maybe you've been kinda worryin' over that .
All just by chance , and in a way tracing back to poor Frank , all of it , because naturally -- brothers , living together -- and Angie --
`` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure .
Two weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , then we make a little deal , isn't it '' ? ?
`` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I don't fool around with it .
I mean , we all figured -- I guess anybody'd figure -- Angie '' --
Of course , there was another factor .
It could all be straightened out later .
After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through .
An ace of spades .
Katya Roslev , who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now , rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change .
Never have to .
`` Think I can't count '' ? ?
he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag , and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom , which tasted peculiarly of face powder .
After he'd got out fresh liver for Bast , he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish .
And I suppose now that you've finally grown up , if a little late , you'd go on producing kittens every six months or so .
`` I've got to get busy .
Drink your coffee '' --
`` Oh .
`` They can't do anything .
Don't question , Rev had said , don't invite danger .
That was not reasonable either .
That made a certain amount of logic .
she wouldn't run like a scared cat .
there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen .
She went downstairs and received another curious shock , for when Glendora flapped into the dining room in her homemade moccasins , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she hadn't .
Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice .
`` Not much breakfast this morning .
`` We've got to eat '' , Sarah said , curtly , because a chill crawled over her again .
`` We'll go to the storehouse '' .
She took Glendora to the smokehouse , unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon , hanging from the smoke-stained rafters .
They wouldn't go hungry , not yet .
Maude .
Maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do .
Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New York .
She started back for the house , saw a light in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder .
Rev , George and Lolotte were mending shoes .
Lolotte looked up and stiffened .
George didn't look up at all .
She thought as warm , drizzling rain touched her face .
It might be , indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love , but it was marriage .
So she couldn't choose Rev as a confidant ; ;
`` Maybe there isn't .
`` I think so .
Also , it's just possible she might know something about Mrs. Gilborn '' .
`` Right .
I'm telling you , if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us to , they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off '' .
He looked at his watch .
Thirty years' experience let him know , even at this early stage , that Black was his man .
After leaving Conrad , Gilborn had no destination .
He simply walked , not noticing where he was , not caring .
Of Kitti .
Emotionally , they penetrated him not at all .
Gilborn remembered Conrad's exact words .
It was so .
When Kitti was alive -- and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm -- she had been the center of his life .
Gilborn passed by him without seeing him .
The police were no longer there .
Who ? ?
Where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger , there is a right-hand one , he remembered from his school days .
He would lie in it no more .
For thirty minutes , Stanley Gilborn stood there .
At the end of the half-hour , racking his brains , thinking over and over again of Kitti , her friends , her past , he left the bedroom .
In the street , walking as quickly as he could , Stanley Gilborn was a lone figure .
She wanted to be with him , to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed .
Men , she reflected , even men like Stanley , are unpredictable .
But he hadn't understood .
Stanley wasn't like that .
Indeed , there was a woman who , unasked , had already given him love .
Unquestionably , Blanche loved Stanley .
There were mornings when Stanley came in late , afternoons when he left early , days when he didn't come in at all .
Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known .
In the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that , pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that .
Felix was the exception .
`` The owner .
He had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short .
The man was just this side of being a freak .
We waited till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him .
Eventually he subsided .
`` Felix '' ? ?
Gibby said .
`` I try '' , Felix said blithely .
`` No rest of it .
`` Those lovely whorls '' , he chortled .
`` We're here because of what happened last night '' , he said .
`` Past , yes , but important .
`` Felix Grubb '' ? ?
`` Felix Grubb '' ? ?
You may think we didn't need Nancy and Jean , but you always get what you can when you can , and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were through with this case .
Felix took us into his studio .
Starting with the room completely blacked out , as it was when we came in , he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare .
The equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition .
`` Our own people .
`` Shall I let them know you're awake '' ? ?
They had spent the morning revising the act , eliminating all the gay songs , patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations .
Charlie Marble was back and forth on several occasions , first to confer with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas engagement -- they decided it was wise -- and later to announce that a prominent comedian , also an agency client , had agreed to fill the casino's open date .
Andy invented a job to keep him busy , sending him ahead to El Dorado to supervise last minute arrangements .
They overflowed the parking lot , making progress by automobile difficult .
Long before he reached the protection of the stage door , Andy was recognized .
But in his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read , `` We're with you all the way '' .
`` I want you to have the speakers taken out '' .
`` What you don't understand is that I'm asking for it now '' .
But Bonner departed , still full of ill will .
But , admit or not , Bonner was helpless .
Following him .
The result had nothing of the polish , pace or cohesion of the previous night .
The worst was yet to come .
As Andy reached the finale of his act , a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings .
Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief .
`` Lullaby and goodnight .
He wondered if the audience would let him finish .
But when he was finally through , their scorn was made apparent .
`` My God '' , he muttered .
`` It's okay , Mr. Paxton .
Do you know what they think of me '' ? ?
Thornburg patted his arm .
Nothing broken that can't be mended '' .
Andy nodded dully .
`` It doesn't matter , Rock .
He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room .
`` Why not '' ? ?
They've found some sort of new evidence , a bundle of clothes or something , and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime .
Young Mrs. Arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits .
`` They took it away , overalls or something '' .
`` Why on earth did I send him off to work ? ?
They found some clothes '' , she tossed in .
I stalled him off .
He passed the receptionist in the outer office , muttering , `` I've got to go out for a little while '' .
What on earth was in Mae's mind , that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing ? ?
She wanted the police to notice him , suspect him .
Though his inner thoughts cringed at it , he forced himself to think back , recreating the scene in which Mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child .
And when he came to examine the scene , there was a certain staginess to it , it had the smell of planning , and a swift suspicion darted into his mind .
He felt light-headed and sick .
Mae was his wife .
She was .
He came to a stretch of old orange groves , the trees dead , some of them uprooted , and then there was an outlying shopping area , and tract houses .
Holden stepped on the gas .
He could tell them his fears of being involved , he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how Mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him -- the scene was complete in his mind at the moment , even to his own jerkings and snivelings , and Ferguson's silent patience .
He was sure of this .
Sure , they're giving up hope .
`` Didn't you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage ? ?
She shook her head .
`` My goodness , you ought to remember if I do .
You're going to have to go to the police and explain what happened .
`` I've never owned any painting overalls .
Different about the mouth , huh ? ?
The twenty-three ( or twenty-two with the Paynes themselves omitted ) provided merely a place to start , and their identification was the barest of starts .
Of course he's in '' -- )
) And know , while all this went on , that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel .
( Detective Pearson , Eighteenth Precinct , thought for a time he might be on to something .
Traces of oil on green tissue ? ?
Mullins came in .
The State cops would check from time to time ; ;
Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger .
Lauren herself ? ?
But -- it happened , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young .
It occurred to Bill Weigand that he was , on a hunch basis , eliminating a good many .
Opportunity was obvious .
Here , too , the cause to hate lay well back in the years .
got Mullins .
`` Send out a pickup on Mrs. Mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on '' , Bill said .
Mullins would do .
that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say , lightly , meaning nothing .
Which probably would turn out to be true ; ;
It was evident that a captain should remain at his desk , directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat .
You just -- `` Hello ? ?
`` Call this a cry for help '' , Faith Constable said .
`` Don't forget , there was the hope it would pass for a natural death '' , Pauling reminded him .
With his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened , saying , `` Uh-huh '' and `` I see '' at intervals .
At last he said , `` Well , thank you for calling , Mr. Benson .
He hung up .
Trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects .
Madden , with his investigation centered on the fraud , said that tomorrow he would go to the Bronx bank through which Mrs. Meeker's checks to Johnston had cleared .
that Mrs. Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; ;
Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come about if Mrs. Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr. Hohlbein or him about it .
Madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement .
Garth brought one out .
`` Fairly recent '' , he remarked .
She always did before , and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised '' .
It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs .
Two millions were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs. Meeker's lifetime , and the proviso made that as long as Brian Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees ( hereinafter appointed by the bank administering the estate ) he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would entail .
A splendid vote of confidence in Thayer , Madden reflected .
He went on to personal bequests , a list of names largely unknown to him .
Madden took up this point with Garth , who shrugged it off .
`` Old people have their idiosyncrasies '' .
the next moment she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate Johnston affair .
No discrepancies or shortages had ever been found .
The lawyer didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party -- Thayer , like himself , Madden reflected , was the extra man so prized by hostesses -- and found him easy enough to talk to .
Motive ? ?
It's still unbelievable that it was murder .
Griffith had confronted Hoag on the building's front steps -- Hoag had been permitted no further -- and backed him against a wrought-iron railing .
It's all in your mind '' .
Griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes .
You wouldn't pull my leg , old man ? ?
`` I'm not pulling your leg .
`` I was hit -- knocked out .
He stared at Hoag drunkenly .
He nodded triumphantly .
`` Where are they '' ? ?
`` Facing us , two flights up .
`` And you know I can do it '' .
`` Yes , what is it '' ? ?
Docherty went taut : was it possible ? ?
Not possible , he thought ; ;
`` Haven't the faintest , Captain '' .
Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building .
it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible .
Mahzeer would stand up , the prime minister would follow .
Hoag would carry its sound to his grave .
Hoag turned .
If only the latter were true .
He went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule .
Now what ? ?
Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes .
Now he was certain : the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys ; ;
What was he to do now ? ?
His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door .
Hoag pushed open the door : at the far end of the long dark room Muller was faintly silhouetted against the window , the rifle still raised ; ;
Muller , nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; ;
The safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries , a hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards , a stack of unsold Policemen's Ball tickets from last year , and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps .
It was more a matter of tact , and also it was none of Killpath's goddam business .
He stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes .
The lieutenant eyed Gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then glanced back at his own face , moving the comb methodically around his head .
Fight with Sam Schaeffer , fight with the whole damned Bureau .
Killpath peered through half-closed lids at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced .
Killpath pulled one thin leg up , clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut .
He put his chin on his kneecap , stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block , and stared wordlessly at his sergeant .
`` Running in , running out .
Roll was being called .
He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk .
Gun knew it was Car 12 , the wagon , returned from delivering Ingleside's drunk-and-disorderlies to the City Jail .
He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' -- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses `` -- failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered .
An argument with Orville Torrence Killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range .
`` Let's just remember , Sergeant , that we must all carry our own umbrella .
If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night , Killpath would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour ; ;
At the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes , remembering then that he'd left them at the Doughnuttery .
Mr. Phillips took a razor to Gonzalez , Prop. , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome .
Casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man .
His name was George Needham and he , too , had come from a good family .
We're going to get married .
She made a face at him and then she laughed .
`` I'll get my references in order '' , Needham said , and though he spoke with a smile , Casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused .
Casey watched them go , still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check .
Jack :
Look in the wastebasket .
I knew the only way I could beat you was to play possum , but it was a good try , kid , and I appreciate it .
For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself .
For another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; ;
He thought : Where the hell could he have gone ? ?
He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered up enough to get some sense .
Then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly .
`` Yeah '' , he said .
Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head .
`` Who says so '' ? ?
Calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his `` boys '' close at hand .
`` I was hired to take a picture .
If that picture gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it , I'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you '' .
`` Just be sure to send your two best boys , Tony '' .
As soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found Jerry Burton's home number .
He had done all he could and that was that .
He considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too .
He had just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again .
For over the years he had received many such calls .
`` We're out just a little too far .
She cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore .
Poet came up from below , wearing new bathing trunks .
Yet tension existed .
`` They are the most efficient '' .
Clasping his hands behind his head , he stared at the blue sky .
Alfredo certainly must have enjoyed being alone .
Someday , geologists had warned , the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the ocean and no more La Jolla or Redondo Beach .
Meanwhile , fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers .
Why , he wondered , had Elaine wanted him along on this trip ? ?
He tossed her a towel , then repeated the service for Poet .
She had caught the implication of the oath .
`` Hurts like hell for a second , then it disappears '' .
At the same instant , Nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man .
But the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage .
The air hose was free ! !
Instinctively he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose .
It's at the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for a hit and run manslaughter -- about seven months ago .
Seeing me he said with real surprise , `` Well , well , ain't we honored ! !
Proves a college education pays off '' .
His sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth .
You're not only young but well , you don't even look like a police officer .
In my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law , big and tough .
Man , when my 275 pounds and six-four comes along , why it's the same as another badge .
When I say move , a guy moves '' ! !
`` Widow , nice sort of woman .
I know the killer , have the only road off the peninsula covered '' .
Anyway , Julia asks me to .
''
`` Julia had -- has -- an old Indian woman cooking for her -- Nellie Harris .
Nellie went on with her house work -- until I found Julia dead .
Being the Harbor's sole doctor , Abel was also its Medical Examiner .
`` Sure '' .
Nellie Harris wasn't old , she was ancient -- a tiny shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune .
She was also stone deaf in her right ear .
She calmly repeated what Moore had told me .
When I asked , `` Why didn't you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was '' ? ?
`` Have you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were arguing about '' ? ?
`` Probably wages .
Miss Julia was a hard woman with a dollar .
`` No sir .
Okay , come on '' .
Mrs. Tim Williams was about 21 , with skin the color of bitter chocolate , and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers , she was startlingly pretty .
The inside of their place was full of new furniture , five bucks down and a buck a week stuff , but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home .
He strong as a bull but gentle as a baby .
`` We'll get him soon , see what he says '' , Chief Moore cut in .
`` Does your husband have a car '' ? ?
Need it for the job '' .
I asked a silly question : `` You've no idea where your husband could be , now '' ? ?
I stood there , staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty .
On my way out I told her , `` If you should eh just happen to see your husband , get him to give himself up .
Hiding out like this won't get him anything , except more trouble , or a bullet '' .
That Jaguar could really barrel along .
Lighting my pipe , I took a walk .
I got into the front seat .
Soak up local color .
Alec smirked .
When Alec finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk .
The clerk's smile congealed .
Alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk .
At the same rate '' .
He raised his voice .
The bellboy unlocked a white door numbered 1105 .
The room looked normal and even commonplace .
The blue rug was suspiciously bright and new .
It had never been stained with blood .
`` Is there anything wrong with this room '' ? ?
The boy hesitated .
There were three -- one leading to a bathroom , one to the hall , and one to the room next door which was immovable -- locked or bolted on the other side .
Alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table .
As he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover .
Not gray like the dust that collects in an unused room , but white .
Women didn't use white face powder nowadays , he recalled .
For the sound was inside the room .
Cautiously Alec tensed his muscles , ready to jump .
He lashed out blindly with his right .
Rough cloth rasped his fist .
The man's shoes were too pointed , his overcoat too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist .
Diana Beauclerk had no connection with the underworld .
`` Don't you speak English '' ? ?
But you realize , I am sure , how much old deeds incite to new ones , and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones .
He was sharpening his razor .
`` Sister '' , said he `` do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven '' ? ?
they are set forth in your own newspapers .
And the truth is what you've come for , is it not ? ?
In fact , all the folk who lived on the back of Cape Ann , they are not just like others .
Scientists say it is the last spewings of a great glacier , but one rather feels that only a malevolent giant could have piled up those crouching monsters of granite which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended , ominous life in them .
A fascinating pursuit , I assure you .
It is now a sweep of boulders and ledges , with oak , walnut and sumac creeping across the common , and everywhere the ruins and the long , long shadows .
Red lived at Lanesville , and from his house he could be up on the Common in a half hour's brisk walk ; ;
They were both painters , ( They were ? ?
As I said , they were both painters .
As I was saying , I've known all about the old records , including the old Norberg deed .
Le rouge et le noir .
It began with a preamble , of course .
I suppose Handley knew it .
You may say this has little pertinence , but , gentlemen , remember that all this prepared my mind , alerted my intelligence .
Rabbits , too , if you care for them , which most of the folk around here haven't the sense to appreciate .
Oh yes , he'd talked about doing so .
In fact , he often disappeared , from time to time , -- off to paint the sea , aboard a dragger out from Gloucester .
He had no ready answer , as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing .
Was the man drunk or crazy or both ? ?
The guy is off his rocker , Haney thought to himself , and looked away from those eyes .
Eyes that were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them .
He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger .
Then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck driver's face , without saying a word .
Now he recalled it very clearly , and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off .
Phil was like that .
I'll do anything for somebody I like .
It won't cost you a cent , Phil .
He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while I'm taking a bath .
When he looked up again , he seemed almost contented .
`` It's my line of work '' , he said
Phil shrugged and ignored him .
The landlord had died .
Late that afternoon , it seemed , he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection .
He had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table , as far as possible from any talkative , friendly lushes .
This favorite grievance was not the landlord .
In fact , he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment .
His real grievance was Lolly .
Haney didn't want to encourage his company , but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow , to prevent possible trouble .
Community property deal -- you know .
That's why I -- why I do a free job now and then .
A retired professional killer If he was just a nut , no harm was done .
After all , I didn't know you , Pete .
`` But if you say you managed it '' The stranger was hooked .
Let me prove it , Phil .
He waited eagerly .
I know where he is , right near here .
Charlie was waiting , leaning against a building front .
I bought another pint of sherry and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark , put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again .
there was no hurry .
The second bottle passed a few times .
He seemed as drunk as when I'd first talked to him , but no drunker .
`` We don't want to know whether he's dead , yet .
Dig '' ? ?
it made sense .
`` Let's put him down again the way he was .
It's a more natural position '' .
We did that .
`` Cool '' , I told him .
`` What do you feel '' ? ?
Well maybe I'm exaggerating .
If they'd been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him '' .
They find dead winos every day , maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of death '' .
Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets .
We did that and found a dirty handkerchief , some matches and fourteen cents in change .
Thinking like that can get you into a padded pad .
We met at Maxine's and decided we were set to stay as long as it took , into or even through the evening , to talk things out .
He gave me equivalent and even more detailed dope on Radic , including diagrams -- one of the apartment building Radic lived in and one of the apartment itself .
`` One thing we haven't discussed , expense money .
I'll go to bat first .
He had been weary ; ;
`` I ought to be asleep , too , but I felt like a snack .
`` Warm enough to swim -- real Indian summer .
`` Don't bother '' , Mike answered .
In the meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother .
Or Antares '' ? ?
He hesitated .
`` Larry teaches plants to grow .
`` Of the humans we left at the equator , one has discorporated and the others are sad '' .
he had not known it until asked .
Presently his water brother said breathlessly .
`` Oh , my ! !
Kiss me again '' .
Is that -- I mean , ' Do you know ' '' --
I'll help '' .
A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and Mrs. Joseph ( `` Shadow of Greatness '' ) Douglas was quoted as saying : `` I would no more sit down without flowers on my table than without serviettes '' .
The Man from Mars had interrupted him with his work half finished -- and that stupid jackass Short was certain to louse it up .
You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me .
Same as with the Popes .
`` You can't touch him .
You shouldn't have tried to .
`` You mean this punk can brush me aside and I've got to hold still for it '' ? ?
I'm helping you now , am I not ? ?
If you need a Day off to calm down , duck over to the Muslim Paradise and take it .
Where do I start '' ? ?
Anyhow , it was high time the boy was salted .
Jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting -- ABC vs D , then BCD vs A or AB vs CD , or AD vs CB , through all ways that four women can gang up on each other .
The expense and time involved are astronomical .
that is all I can tell you about them .
Was ? ?
As I grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where I was .
If I get a low M. R. , I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does .
`` Please pardon me again , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .
The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth .
I am married '' .
And , if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce '' .
In his great and glorious wisdom , he knew that our enemies the Israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned '' .
`` I volunteer '' , said Hal .
Southern China , all of southeast Asia , southern India and Ceylon , these states of the Malay Federation spoke Bazaar .
Siberia spoke Icelandic .
Its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper .
If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way .
Mary was as frozen below the navel as he .
Pornsen .
He would no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice
Said the whining voice .
There was the squat loose-jowled man , smiling lopsidedly up at him .
They would sleep while the Gabriel's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured .
Many years later , the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration .
And , from the first , he faced a difficult task .
Moreover , even getting this across would be difficult .
the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar .
Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo .
Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word .
This is not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an Angel it takes time .
`` We had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice .
His heart , he discovered , was pounding .
`` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth .
`` Hesperus and Lucifer '' , Jack said , `` show that we do '' .
of curiosity ; ;
`` But this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the dictates of their own natures , and respect yours in turn .
The Angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the Earthmen -- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature .
The simple treaty principle that Gabriel was asking him to ratify , in short , was nothing less than total trust .
There was no question in Jack's mind of the good faith on one side , at least .
In fact , it had to be tried .
The Angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in all directions , seemingly at random .
Jack scanned the skies , the boards , and the skies again .
If that was the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed .
It seemed unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the Ariadne , for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a light-year .
It was clear that Langer had at last found a way to attract the Angel's attention .
Langer would have to be headed off , whether he knew where he was going or not .
When he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses , however , he hesitated .
`` I'm going to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do .
`` Ekstrohm '' ? ?
Ryan insisted .
That cold , empty sky was full of fire and light .
But to the infuriation of scientists , for no known reason not all of them did .
`` No helmets '' , the captain answered .
It just won't be easy .
`` Ryan , look over there '' , Nogol said .
Ekstrohm smiled , and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall .
The strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects .
They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground .
Well , it has to happen .
It sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me .
Of course , that's not definite proof '' .
What killed them '' ? ?
Maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and don't have any R's stored up , they could take a lot without harm '' .
`` Then maybe it was the shockwave we set up .
They curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a spaceship '' .
`` Maybe '' , the captain admitted .
These critters went real sudden '' .
Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet .
Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on Yancey-6 138 .
It was small comfort for insomnia .
Others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept .
Occasionally he fell into a waking , gritty-eyed stupor ; ;
but he never slept .
On impulse , he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble .
Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations , smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air .
Behind him , his mates stirred without waking .
Now comes this ! !
`` What could I do with your lousy dead bodies ? ?
Suspicion wasn't new to him at all .
Helva .
Helva's civilization was not without busy , do-good associations , exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial citizens .
When they were forced to , Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the Laboratory Schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories , complete with photographs .
Helva asked , politely .
If she could have blushed , she would have .
`` Here , this will help '' , suggested Helva , substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture .
In a kind of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed Last Supper on the head of a screw .
`` Well '' , remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife , `` the good Lord can eat where angels fear to tread '' .
`` I had that in mind '' .
`` Of course '' .
But `` singing '' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome .
She approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental .
For their purposes , oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells .
The neural , audio , visual and sensory connections were made and sealed .
Her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed .
She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner .
Consequently no one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective partners .
Had there been another `` brain '' ship at the Base at the moment , Helva would have been guided to make the first move .
As it was , while Central wrangled among itself , Robert Tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks , out to the field and over to Helva's slim metal hull .
`` All you have to do is ask '' , he retorted hopefully .
`` No one has come .
I thought perhaps there were no partners available and I've had no directives from Central '' .
Even to herself Helva sounded a little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field .
Always she had had the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score .
The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive .
He tried to run after B'dikkat , to hug the lead spacesuit , to tell B'dikkat that he loved him .
You're beautiful , beautiful , beautiful .
She radiated warmth and good fellowship .
He tried to tell the Lady Da , but the words weren't quite straight .
The drug went after the pain and swallowed it .
He rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert , `` That was a good bite .
That would make B'dikkat happy '' ! !
Said she , `` I'm strong , too .
The half-man lay on the ground , arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity .
`` You mean a game with cards '' ? ?
But we never know how long a scene is going to take '' .
`` No , no , no .
A scene is just a part of a play .
When Mercer looked on helplessly , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to Mercer , and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself .
When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer's thigh , he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body .
He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ;
The next time it was two legs growing from his chest .
The secret little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B'dikkat .
Was B'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day , surrounded by a family of little cow-people resembling himself ? ?
Her statement was a hope , not a truth in which they could believe .
He was well rid of her .
If he had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble .
But all of this was rationalization .
He had no idea how much time Budd would give him .
It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up .
Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl .
It must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding .
Both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features .
She drank greedily , and murmured , `` Thank you '' , as he lowered her head .
Morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove .
Morgan nodded .
`` You mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work '' ? ?
`` There's only one more ranch three miles north of here .
You'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places '' .
Could you give us a job , Mr. ''
They might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house .
He'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either .
`` I've been mucking in a mine in the San Juan , but I used to work on a ranch .
Sharon , she's cooked in a restaurant .
Your wife's in terrible shape '' .
When the meal was ready , he told Jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl .
I'm usually a very strong woman , but I'm awfully tired '' .
`` We're not drunkards '' , she said .
`` That's all I'm sure of '' .
`` We'll see '' , Morgan said .
Jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him .
He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' .
`` We got fired '' , Jones said .
Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see .
He whispered .
He got into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son .
It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so .
Clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , `` No '' .
Laurel is gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me .
That would mock me too much ! !
`` The horses .
There's someone there I have to see .
We may take her with us -- to California .
`` California '' .
`` I made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered .
`` Yes , Gavin , you did '' .
`` I hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said .
`` I loved this valley '' , he whispered huskily .
The two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness .
The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before .
In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .
Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .
You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone '' .
First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley .
He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party .
He treats her like she was dirt .
He meant to help Gavin all the time .
There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place .
`` He killed Tom -- do you understand that '' ? ?
Thirty-six
Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement .
Susan halted Dean and kissed him .
Susan said fiercely .
He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her .
`` Stay well back of me '' , he said .
`` I'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I'm one of the guerrillas .
The startled horses began rearing on their tethers .
Dean came rushing up .
`` Why not you '' ? ?
`` No telling how good this horse is '' , Mike panted .
I'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you '' .
Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back .
These poured through the gate and joined the flight .
The animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges .
All were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all .
He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner .
He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration .
Its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again .
Lew Durkin yelled .
Hustle '' ! !
But it had missed the bone and had passed on through .
There's a large war party on their way '' ! !
Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal .
Oso gave me an unruffled look .
Let Old Knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else '' ? ?
That's why the British never got the tribes to fight for the King .
Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses .
As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso's logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company .
`` Let the savages kill each other .
Attack
Gray Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky .
Our camp was in the center of a wide valley .
He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire .
The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ;
At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses' heads .
His face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; ;
My God , how long is he going to wait , I thought .
The feathered lance was still above his head .
`` Lead up ! !
A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy .
`` For Christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em '' ! !
The charge , I tell you '' ! !
I could see the blood running down his chest .
A small Indian dived at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt .
I could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil .
`` You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size .
He was losing patience again .
An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company .
She had helped him change his mind .
`` I'm not advising you '' , she said .
`` I'm telling you .
Let it burn down .
`` There's some mistake '' , he said finally .
I'm not leaving in the morning .
Why should I ? ?
Maybe you know him '' .
Wilson didn't say anything .
She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him .
`` No '' , Wilson said .
And it doesn't make any difference .
`` Never mind '' , she said sternly .
`` It wouldn't matter to my father , and not to me .
It made him a little sick , and he let go of her .
He got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her .
`` I am .
`` I can take care of this .
`` Not now '' , Wilson said .
Not yours .
I don't know what goes on around here , and I don't care .
You took me by surprise .
She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .
He had forgotten that she was so pretty .
`` Both of you .
He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream .
He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out .
That afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house , his hopes had been high .
Not all of it .
And they had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses .
The place had been cheap -- just the little he had left after Amelia's burial -- and it would serve its purpose .
They had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses .
But there was water .
It was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better .
A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road .
It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville .
His job simply consisted in registering new men .
He spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality .
When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle I noticed how the clerk winced .
Once , pressing him , I learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall .
With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air .
When he saw me coming he turned his radio off .
What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me .
In the mornings , I was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall .
He pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words .
Now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand .
Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient .
No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention .
And I had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently .
It sprang from a type of mentality I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here .
I felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance .
I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to .
Sometimes I noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs .
It resembled nothing I'd ever seen before .
But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it .
For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there .
He was a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; ;
he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar .
He wore perforated , white-topped shoes ; ;
Begging my pardon , he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall .
This desire , I went on , growing voluble as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing .
Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head , hard .
The man went over without sound , falling to the bare floor .
`` Let's get one thing straight , you and me .
`` Come on .
The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts .
He had been one of the original Night Riders , one who had escaped the trial .
Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself , shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants , the worn brown shirt .
`` Meaning you want me to ride out '' ? ?
He did not trust Rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct .
But ten years in prison had taught him realities .
He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money .
Both hated Donald Kruger .
The old Haskell mine '' .
Barton nodded .
`` My boy .
Again Dill hesitated .
He wants your ranch '' .
He said tensely , `` All right .
Dill had come up also .
`` I was afraid of this .
My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away .
It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame .
It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences .
The gravel was the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth .
A million dollars' of gold a month .
Their roar , like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles .
He was a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air .
Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt .
Kodyke was to head the dread company police .
Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches .
She had offered to walk , but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called `` Auntie '' .
He had belonged to this land and , perhaps , had desecrated it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him .
There was only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that unnamed , unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom .
It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation , beg forgiveness .
Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along .
She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants .
A few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; ;
Unconcerned , indifferent , unmotivated , the forest was simply there -- fighting man's depredations with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical evening laughter .
knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man .
they would not dare to face his scoffing .
The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles .
It was a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress , eclipsing the sun and human time .
She stood quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her .
It enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles .
She had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , depriving her of reason and sight .
bushes swished and scratched at her slacks ; ;
But '' --
`` But it don't matter a-tall '' , Lord supplied fondly .
After a time , he straightened again , brushing the red Permian dust from his hands , slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five-dollar shirt .
Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package .
If I could make myself feel the same way
against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis .
rather on the medium side .
And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance .
She snapped .
`` Or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar '' ? ?
Now , are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk '' ? ?
`` Might get there faster walkin' '' , Lord drawled , `` seein' as how I got a busted front spring .
There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes '' .
`` See that wildcat '' ? ?
Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ? ?
She looked at him , lips compressed .
Otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum -- teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood .
`` Well , I'll tell you about that '' , Lord told him .
`` I know you've got a grudge against me , and maybe I can't blame you .
He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront .
He , McBride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go scot-free , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too energetically .
Donna was like he was .
When he regained consciousness he was in Lord's house , in the office of Doctor Lord , the deputy's deceased father .
Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon .
Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now .
But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern .
Even as she called to the children , Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon .
`` Wait a little while .
Give her time to miss you .
`` A year , Luis ? ?
What would you do in my place '' ? ?
And the boy will need his mother .
But I'm going to have my son '' .
And Hank Maguire added , `` So am I , Tom '' .
`` All right '' , Brannon said , rising .
With him were Hank Maguire , Luis Hernandez , and Luis's son Pedro .
Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside .
But he felt no physical discomfort .
Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps .
Macklin was the third man to come out , and he came unhurriedly .
They closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun .
`` Don't start anything you can't finish '' .
`` Now , listen '' -- Macklin began .
`` Brannon , I warn you '' ! !
The other five Slash-B men followed them inside , crowding the small room .
His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms .
`` Every last one of you .
`` Now , hold on , damn it ; ;
Brannon said .
No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there .
He held out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure .
`` Get it out '' , Brannon ordered .
For , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them .
Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing .
He'd grin .
Publicly , he denied everything .
He looked around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest .
`` Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he'd blandly announce .
No man's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo .
`` Well '' , he explained , `` s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope ? ?
But there's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just don't think there is , and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man '' ! !
After the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored .
The lesson had been learned .
For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man .
( The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $125 , very good money in an era when top hands worked for $30 and found .
) Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark .
The wailing , guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him .
Vastly relieved , Summers nodded and started toward the door .
`` One thing , Summers '' , Brenner said .
Summers pulled up short , and turned around .
Curt approached the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees .
He found a match in his pocket and lit it .
As Curt had hoped , the house door banged open .
Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice .
Jess cursed again , and entered the barn .
`` Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house .
Now turn around so I can see your face '' .
Jess turned .
`` You're about as dumb as they come , Adams .
Now start talking .
`` No .
Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention .
It was like hitting a sack of salt .
Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose .
By now Curt was seeing clearly again .
What's going on out there '' ? ?
He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble '' .
The buckskin bolted out of the stall .
Curt opened the door , grabbed Black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn .
You're coming along peacefully , or I'll put a bullet in your leg '' .
Somebody in this town must still have some backbone '' .
What a spectacle he was , caked with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian , kissing the finest , the sweetest , the bravest , and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world .
But his only hat was something else again .
`` Nate ! !
Nate '' ! !
`` Nate '' ! !
`` I ain't going to fight you no more '' .
Nate turned his head , attempting to speak in a soothing voice .
Slipping her hand in his , they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight .
Soon they were all shouting greetings , exchanging smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again .
`` Come spring , you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too , gal '' .
He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers .
She was glad , completely and unselfishly glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan .
Not with the memory of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close .
Out in the center of the circle the farmer , who was Dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , `` The farmer choose his wife '' .
Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness .
Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them .
`` A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud '' ! !
`` That wasn't nothing at all '' ! !
`` Quit ragging him , Gran '' , Rod protested .
`` I ain't ragging him '' ! !
`` But honest-to-Betsy , I've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon '' .
`` Rheumatics worse , Pa '' ? ?
`` Wonder what made them hurry so '' , Rod drawled , giving Dan a sly wink .
`` We'll double teams zigzagging up the mountain , Harmony '' , he spoke reassuringly , concerned by the pinched look around her mouth .
Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero .
Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch .
His eyes widened .
While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry , with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday .
`` Where yuh goin' '' ? ?
A single kick made it spring open , shuddering .
But he was more than half-drunk , and his faculties were dulled .
I've drawn his fangs '' , he snapped .
`` Look at this '' ! !
Carmer's ingenious cache for his loot had been found .
Leaving the card room , they moved back through the Palace the way they had come .
It was you that tracked it down anyway , Stevens '' , he pursued strictly .
Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered .
`` Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs .
Giving the other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street .
How much of an accident could that be '' ? ?
Toward the west this depression led toward a draw .
He had been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot .
Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunged forward with undiminished speed .
Gradually the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range .
Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions .
Every plane that could fly was sent into the air .
Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte .
His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot .
`` I've got her as neat as I can '' , Donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg's shoulders .
`` But this goddamn climate .
The expression was his trade-mark , his open sesame to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return .
The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan .
The low clouds made bombing difficult .
Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle .
Friend or enemy ? ?
Todman said excitedly , and hopefully .
Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower .
But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course .
Todman , you take the one on the left .
You'll bust your ass in this canyon .
The enemy did not veer .
It did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted .
It was all Greg had time to see .
gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold .
Just as p'lite an -- an cohnfidunt , an Ah says ' Uh coahse you cain't ' , but he says ' Whah nawt , you ah hevin one ' ? ?
`` No , I don't '' , Johnson said .
And re-echo .
Hardly had Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck , father or grandfather of Senor `` Moriarty's '' Ford sedan , came screeching to a dust-swirling stop , and a brown face appeared , its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window .
I drew back , drawing back my foot for a kick .
`` Hell , yes '' , I roared back between dusty lips .
When I fell on my back , I saw a vulture hovering .
`` Drink your beer '' .
I drank furiously .
Emptied the bottle .
Teeth again flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which `` amigo '' appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound .
The Indian was again raising his bottle , but to my astonished relief -- probably only a fraction of Johnson's -- the bottle this time went to the Indian's lips .
Another car was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill .
In the ditch sand was white and soft-looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming .
On the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery ; ;
The Indian's arm whipped sidewise -- there was a flash of amber and froth , the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car .
Plus flawless skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them .
She was wearing nothing beneath the coat .
There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out , and now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before .
`` Oh , do forgive me .
`` You may have seen me on TV '' , she said .
And you recognized me '' ? ?
In fact , I was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell .
Ah , you were splendid '' .
`` That's the last one we did .
It wouldn't -- wouldn't seem fair , somehow '' .
`` Murder ? ?
They'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when -- with the addition of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign -- sales had soared practically into orbit .
The water in Thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds -- fashioned , of course , from zing -- Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled .
The finished -- and drastically cut -- product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender lather , and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap ; ;
even to clean men and boys .
He wanted a few stills for magazine ads , he said .
And he didn't have any clothes on '' .
`` Yes , he didn't .
Did , I mean '' .
`` Did leap into the pool , and didn't have anything on .
But I'm pleased to hear '' --
While several yards from it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge .
Or at least not to Joyce .
There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room .
`` You might as well wait here while I'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like '' .
`` Oh , I'd love to '' .
That was all she said .
However , when there's a job to be done , I'm a monstrosity of grim determination , I like to think .
As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower .
Accident , murder , suicide -- take your pick '' .
If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do , and now I understand why they are classics ; ;
those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick .
When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted .
The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure .
One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt .
There was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me .
The artist looks at an ankle , a calf , a bosom and , in his mind's eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is .
Why she married him I do not know .
Perhaps , with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ;
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ;
There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour .
`` But now what '' ? ?
`` Tell him I made a pass at you '' .
She raised a protesting hand with a startled air .
I don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets .
We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain .
If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him .
In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain .
I exclaimed .
He had better write a postcard to Walter .
He opened the myth book again and there ( along the margin next to Robert Graves' imaginative interpretation of the creation of the Dactyls from Rhea's fingertips ) were the names of four Munich bars and Meredith Wilder's address .
That ought to draw a laugh , Nicolas reasoned , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind .
His four weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months .
He had returned to the pension a week ago .
Now , he was just in the late poems of Holderlin and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him -- plus next semester's class preparation .
The menace of Manas gradually faded as Meredith asked himself should he translate it , ' How the dark fates laughed ' ? ?
She didn't have the heart .
And when you get off this job tonight , well , you can gimme something to eat '' .
He used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions .
He sneezed .
Mary Jane got up , quietly , and walked away .
She had retreated to this world .
'' ( The Grafin was partial to the word shall .
)
Shall we allow her not to have a bath ? ?
Actually , she is a sad beauty , I believe .
Before dinner , he shaved for the second time that day .
Singing into the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan .
She had touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual .
Wine : `` Then you were typing poems this afternoon '' ? ?
Like as if it were built of books '' .
Having opened the windows onto the terrace , lit the fire , translated the motto , Meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin .
`` Those sweet girls ? ?
Oh you're joking .
in reading , on platforms , even in the large auditorium of the Y.M.H.A. , Poetry Center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy .
His new poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed .
The husband points the steps out with his flashlight : `` Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind brim with appetite , Bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes soak all night , '' ( Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was blushing at this line , or was it the fire ? ?
I can never pronounce it '' .
They smiled .
Kissing her he whispered , several times , `` Eurydice '' .
The third time rather urgently .
They were west of the Sabine , but only God knew where .
Thank the Lord , they still had water ! !
A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice .
He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river .
`` We can get it if we dig '' , he said patiently .
`` Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves '' .
In a way , he couldn't blame her .
They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them .
`` I might have starved , but at least I wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt '' ! !
He had never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina .
Too late , he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge .
But she sat on in stubborn silence .
The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake .
Their world turned black .
They cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom .
The cloudburst cut off abruptly .
Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored .
Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon .
The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling .
Somebody was riding the tree .
The pale blob of the woman disappeared .
They were already swollen to bursting .
He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished .
He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate .
Still , he felt better .
He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk , holding her meager treasures .
He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs .
the boat's come unstuck '' .
Brassnose , Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat .
`` I think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said .
`` I know something about Eromonga .
it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs .
I expected Brassnose -- as a man with a strain of Melanesian in his blood -- to speak to them .
So , I mustered my few words of the Manu dialect and said , `` We greet you in peace .
My friends and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire .
You shall have food , water and rest '' .
Some had been there for years ; ;
The man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul .
Not so soon , anyway .
I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne .
This was the worst thing I could have said .
At first , I thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this .
Besides , terror had sapped some of Frayne's vitality and will .
My last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face
.
Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive , I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women .
The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood .
In the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling I saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground .
Ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack .
Somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver .
Anyway , he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at .
Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think .
Benson said , referring to the Indian .
`` If you want to see something , he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car '' .
A few minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state .
The truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay .
How would you ever see her again ? ?
The feeling subsided , it was only a small yearning .
The girl looked around at the countryside .
The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .
He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows .
He was very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster .
`` Don't '' .
There was a gentle concern in Benson's voice .
The man said with a tone of impatience .
But what is it ? ?
After what seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it .
Blood dripped down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color .
The girl looked around quickly at several of the people .
Ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer .
He slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots .
The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .
She's got guts , thought Keith .
But her beauty always surprised him anew .
Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .
`` We're all God's creatures , aren't we '' ? ?
Keith was snarling now .
You love this village and these stinking brown people because they're God's creatures , too .
`` There isn't anything left to say , is there , Keith '' ? ?
She softly let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader .
And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically , who might even survive .
He enjoyed the killing .
Nowadays , we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish .
He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .
He had strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier .
But they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly .
This time , they had been lucky .
There was a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered .
The blast damaged , but did not destroy the room .
Keith's eyes met Penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction .
It wasn't that , however , which decided them not to go to America .
He couldn't stop killing .
When they got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy .
This was the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread .
Mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close .
`` I loused it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice .
So you turn around '' .
I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening '' .
But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think .
`` That's my boy '' ! !
He was a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels .
`` I do not drink so much , thank you '' .
His open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence .
I like that kid '' .
`` Well , no '' , Herr Schaffner said .
Shaffner looked at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands .
Never , never did I offer him the exclusive rights .
`` Well , let's let him make up his own mind , OK '' ? ?
There was no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said .
`` I will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive .
I will make him distributor for all of Florida -- a big market .
The story was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ;
And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ;
`` You know what they say about two deep dives in one day '' , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently .
The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery .
For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .
Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .
Matsuo lifted his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness .
Even now , like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows .
A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing .
Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird .
A spectacle occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ;
Taking aim at the man's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind .
Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke .
It ended when he tumbled ; ;
but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction .
In the hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense .
Gradually he reached a conclusion .
Too bad the marine had no water .
Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips .
Matsuo shook his head .
Sake .
So that had been his difficulty .
The smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts .
Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; ;
He would soon die .
He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .
The marine nodded vigorously .
The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol .
`` Marine .
Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .
He asked .
`` I don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking '' :
Most of the time I get what I ask for '' .
`` And me '' , said another Blue Throat henchman .
Somebody brought a light .
Tilghman and his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner .
In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .
Any posse riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire .
`` There's only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store '' .
He called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom .
He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .
Blue Throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed .
He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890's .
On a bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's ranch .
It was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside .
The two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door .
Tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire .
He wouldn't look Tilghman in the face .
Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .
He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .
`` You'll stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .
But the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets .
When he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh .
He hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order .
That night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire .
`` No , I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs .
He felt a little sick at his stomach .
`` Don't you play hard today then .
Just then Charles Lever yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` Good-bye , Mom '' over his shoulder .
`` Whaddya say , boy '' ? ?
`` You know what I done last night '' ? ?
But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles' revelations ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now .
`` Jist like that '' ? ?
When she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` Goody , goody '' .
Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head .
When he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up .
He scarcely saw them .
She said with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms .
His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .
The coachman said softly .
`` This one is a tender chicken , oui ? ?
Really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with displeasure .
Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .
I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .
But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume .
His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .
The ball broke up in confusion .
Delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse .
the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .
He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .
Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .
He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .
at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot .
The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .
A poet , yet ! !
`` None of that .
We run a respectable house here '' .
He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .
`` Now stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped irritably .
We don't know this guy '' .
`` Oooo , square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up .
His head came up and he said it defiantly .
But not just yet .
`` I'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith '' .
They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .
Why , we got dinner right here .
`` Yeah , but what're we gonna eat ? ?
`` Hot dogs , man .
`` I self-served '' .
`` How come you're riding the rods , kids like you '' ? ?
It was all my fault .
He thought , Pull out of it , old son .
`` Wanna drink '' ? ?
Ernie stared at the man .
Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .
The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .
He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .
He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .
The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump ! !
The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .
Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .
He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud .
or the smell of thick tomato paste -- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour -- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth .
It went to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession .
With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop .
His voice had not commanded her to stop .
It had not questioned why .
But when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar ? ?
It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors .
Did the Old Man remember them there ? ?
Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy .
The Old Man's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich .
He would not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park .
Nor would he work at all .
He would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step .
He could do that when he would be a man .
He called to his sister on the porch above the steps .
But the goat would not .
Soothing it with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch .
The boy's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .
The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .
The clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks .
He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta's idiot brother .
Pompeii expected Romeo's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground .
She was so heavy that Maggie's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her .
Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him .
Maggie and Stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more .
She had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .
`` Evadna Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old '' .
`` Evadna Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from Best's Liliputian Bazaar in New York , and I'm sick and tired of hearing about Evadna Mae Evans '' .
I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money '' .
`` What else '' ? ?
Eugenia sighed .
`` What '' ? ?
there never had been a need felt for such facilities .
and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay .
Shivering , people talked and argued ; ;
Something had to be done .
Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma's room .
Unusual in a case like this , but '' --
Why should I want pictures of an empty room now ? ?
Tolley's going is my fault .
He kissed her .
`` Under the window in stormy weather
Reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash .
Simply call Mr. Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr. Dunne P.GA , and C'un Major Frank .
Another weakness -- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley's .
Her horse , rather .
And what had happened ? ?
Never , `` Quit that , you sor'l devil '' ! !
Gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant -- Tolley , the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach .
Jenny's aversion to having Dr. Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .
Yet when the dear baby came , he had Tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been .
Now she must be thinking of a boy-name , something special .
What about Royal Robards ? ?
Roy was deeply distressed .
There was an idea .
`` Have a party an' leave 'em out , hon '' , he suggested .
`` Don't you dare ! !
Zion was surprised when Roy's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town .
But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .
Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .
Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards .
She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .
After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .
Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .
The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .
`` Rummaging in the dew '' , said Rosa coldly .
For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .
Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested .
On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .
`` Summer's been slow to come '' , he said .
`` I'm taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .
It rests the tissues '' .
`` You do seem to '' , said Henrietta , impressed .
Man in a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .
`` You'd be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws .
She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .
`` Milk and sops '' ! !
He looked piously to heaven and said , `` Beer don't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence .
`` Not me .
I've got a day's work to do .
She put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .
He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength .
They were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .
A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .
The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain .
She had been in Japan just one week .
Ships from the West Coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the Seventh Fleet , and Yokosuka was the Seventh Fleet's principal port for maintenance , upkeep and shore liberty .
He came through from the Fleet Bar , which was stag , with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried .
he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in Hong Kong , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant .
Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different .
The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy .
For a steak sandwich , or `` Kohi Futotsu '' ! !
Now there was raucous male singing from the Fleet Bar .
Then , after a while , she went to her mirror .
She certainly looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men .
He had come into the Navy too young , with the image of the fun-loving Guns Appleby before him .
He may not rise to the heights , but he can get by , and eventually be retired .
This gave Doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well .
`` Come over and have a drink .
He considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk .
Strippers , but scrumptious , and Toodle Williams and her all-lesbian band '' .
She said , semi-professionally .
Smug , Owen thought , smug and sappy .
What would happen next ? ?
He asked curiously .
`` I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around the corridors , knocking on strangers' doors and talking down Eskimos '' .
I do this work all on my own , because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these lay-sisters .
Owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldn't help himself .
`` That's hardly a Christian approach '' , she remonstrated .
`` I didn't say it was Christian .
Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics '' .
why go on ? ?
More people were passing ; ;
it's such a big seller '' .
`` Leave a card or something .
`` You haven't been listening to what I've been telling you .
His lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony , and there was a letter from the Collector of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's exemptions .
There were more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a flowerpot .
She sat down and played two slots at once , looking grim , as if bested by mechanical devices , and Owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support .
I'm with the Bar-H , pushing a horse called Sparky .
When he looked in the back , Mrs. Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards .
There was no cash around ; ;
everyone was flipping silver dollars .
`` I'm allergic to Tahoe '' , Owen explained .
`` I haven't had any luck since I was a baby '' .
We'll get it in a hurry and get it out '' .
`` It sort of brings a lump to my throat '' .
Alexander said , `` Answer me properly , Spencer '' .
He saw the dangers , not the glories of being identified as a mutineer .
Who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who '' --
Alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed .
Their strategy was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip Spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated .
When the mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers .
Not a man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny .
`` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke in .
Wales said , `` Of course they would .
They are about to do so at any moment as it is .
Anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand '' .
He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon .
And we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many '' .
How had he failed ? ?
And Alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame .
He said , `` Captain , may I speak , please ? ?
`` Surely , Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything '' .
`` No , Cromwell , I did not find your name .
He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .
The red-haired captain , towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer .
`` Spencer , if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent ? ?
I have nothing to gain by defending Cromwell '' .
His eyes went back to contemplation of the sea .
The boatswain was as guilty as any .
The air smelled warmish and foul .
The girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings .
He turned his surly , half-closed eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in Yiddish , `` One , two , three '' ! !
Each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of Europe .
They had large bright eyes , the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces .
They bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher .
The teacher plunged the children into a new portion , this time in Hebrew , rapping the stick incessantly .
In the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap .
I stared at him for a long time .
My eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys .
I rubbed my hands together .
I reached into the pocket of my skirt , fingered ten pruta , and dropped the coin .
When we were fighting , a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass .
Rachel faced me .
In this section '' ? ?
`` Here , nothing .
She took it with her wherever she went ; ;
Ready to follow her impulse .
She had good friends here , people who liked her .
All his family was dead , except for his son .
She went to the father and found he had hanged himself '' .
`` Yes '' , I said .
She was pale and skinny ; ;
For one whole week he never let her stay alone .
And I'll take you with me .
Wednesday nights after youth fellowship .
Like Mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would .
For you don't share him , not even with God .
If it is love , you don't .
You feel him every mile further away .
You wonder about the Christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you .
The mayor envisioned factories there .
The bands were impatient , but they were the only ones .
`` I should have stayed at the store '' , she thought .
Back at the Factory-to-You with the other old maids , back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions , like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down .
I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie Press ; ;
the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the fifteenth-century armor , furnishings , clothes .
There was the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye .
We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted .
He also had , at times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; ;
Attending the life class was my idea -- or rather , Askington's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two wouldn't have gone if I hadn't talked them into it .
It was the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting .
The night we first met , at one of Mrs. Monmouth's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; ;
This set his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off's rent for a year .
the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain .
I asked .
`` No , I take classes with different people '' , he said .
He made a circle with his thumb and fingers .
One of these days , I'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days , from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism , and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other .
The eye is all , inward or outward .
`` I'm studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied .
`` Osric Pendleton '' ? ?
Contact with him is stimulating .
And that's the trouble with so many artists today .
He was a propagandist -- they weren't afraid of the word , then -- satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party .
The upshot of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning .
After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work .
No , that isn't quite fair .
Actually , there was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week .
`` What a fool I've been '' , she said quietly .
I love you , I hate you , I feel like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living .
I made a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend .
At last , I thought , she's recovering her spirits .
It was foggy that evening , but the path to my house was so well grooved that I could feel my way , accustomed as I was to the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river and sometimes last for days .
Even at a car's length I could sense that something was wrong , and so I followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house .
The search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening closets , talking , exclaiming in rushes and gasps .
She was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff .
When a fisherman brought her up in his arms , still , small , as if she were a child asleep , I began to shudder with a terrible excitement , almost triumphant , that I still cannot account for .
That at last the vigilance , the will gives way ? ?
I knew '' ! !
Everyone stared at me and drew back .
It is not their avoidance that rankles ; ;
She frowned .
She was finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice .
I waited .
`` I had a rather small place of my own .
But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' .
`` Umm , uhhu '' .
My name's Carla Caneli .
Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance ? ?
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
`` Nothing .
`` They're an expensive English shoe for walking around a lot .
That day they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city .
All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself .
`` It's ten o'clock .
He wondered Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security .
It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself .
But where ? ?
A half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass .
`` Since we're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' .
There's so little to do '' .
`` I am what I am .
I can't help it '' .
Acting only as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal .
Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar ? ?
Just the same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country .
And Sam thanked her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope .
Agnese had been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity of the unaware .
The Pope , in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglected them a little .
Jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent .
Going , he saw as often before some queer , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs .
Go back where you can bring no harm , or I will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame '' ! !
They were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought .
`` Go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women .
I thought I dreamed of wolves fighting '' .
And , shoving her against a spruce , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air , shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked , settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged , as dark and motionless as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face .
Suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard Pile of Clouds say in his high , quavering voice :
For a while the young men waited outside the lodge of TuHulHulZote , glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself .
He shouted like a hoarse old mastiff , his hair stiff and bristling .
Now they moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them .
And the suspicious , envenomed eyes of Pile of Clouds .
even like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs .
The ,
young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening .
They leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted , ejaculated their grotesque cry of war .
She stood , once more listening .
This was her place .
She was thinking of Paul a few weeks ago , in the Easter holidays , with her at one of those awful Friday Evening Dancing Class parties her mother had made her attend .
`` Hello , Julie , how are you '' ? ?
He was walking across to the bathroom .
He drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands .
the stains weren't too apparent ; ;
He shivered , and then tore away the blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf .
Millie would have to understand .
What time was it ? ?
He barely knew himself .
He entered the hallway .
The voice issued from the cavern of the hall below .
George did not reply .
`` Is that you , Father ? ?
Who's there '' ? ?
`` Uncle George '' ! !
I'm all set .
I'll drop you off '' .
It's quite a big one '' , he added .
She had disappeared .
She went ahead of him .
He could not stop to analyze .
He had never felt particularly close to her .
She said nothing until Pietro had slackened their pace .
`` I know you feel badly , but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say '' .
Just a few more steps .
Abruptly he reached into his pocket .
`` Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself '' ? ?
For a moment he smiled .
Don't work too hard '' .
He should have discovered a more tender farewell .
He had put down the receiver .
In the office you might have thought them only casual friends ; ;
She's a year older than I am , Lucy told herself .
Every doll in the house must be going with her '' .
Jim's fine young face was an expressive one , too ; ;
as he looked at her , it registered anxiety .
`` You know '' , he said .
`` Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy .
`` She should have told me herself .
Remember what happened the last time '' ? ?
His dark brows , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed .
they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage .
Lucy was sick of it .
Susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse ; ;
`` Now , now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , mopping skillfully .
The day was brilliant around her -- flower-scented , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it .
Well , Lucy ? ?
She said to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds .
In the sunshine of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room .
`` I just thought I'd let you know .
There was a momentary pause , and then her mother said , `` How long is she supposed to stay '' ? ?
She hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them .
it was only too true .
For a moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger thickened it .
She said .
Quint couldn't blame Maggie for disbelieving .
Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge .
He was Canute controlling the waves .
Fearless .
Every night when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light ? ?
Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ;
While I'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? ?
In the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out .
`` You just wait , Dad .
He called her `` Fatso '' .
She called him `` Stuck-up -- that's why nobody plays with you , Mister Stuck-up '' .
He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks .
`` Is '' .
`` Sure .
`` Then why don't you stop squinting '' ? ?
Quintus in Latin means '' --
`` Do you '' ? ?
Dr. Fortman says if I exercise my leg more , maybe I can use a cane when I'm big '' .
What kind '' ? ?
He's been sick lately .
`` A what '' ? ?
`` Which continent '' ? ?
Camels in Tripoli had harelips .
Quint smothered a yawn .
She skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear .
Let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' .
And `` What time did the Chinaman go to the dentist ? ?
Next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the V-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around .
`` You can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain je ne say quok '' .
A cave seemed to be opening in Quint's stomach .
The baby can have an early nap .
What caused it , he didn't know .
Sweating so much ? ?
`` Of course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , Mousie Chandler said to Linda Stuart .
`` Poor John '' ! !
He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did .
She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at Longue Vue , but her bathing suits were far from smart .
Others thought he couldn't stand seeing Linda , Mrs. Bobbie Evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything .
There were less-dramatic reasons too .
It probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but Edythe to come home to .
He was an attentive and generous husband , overgenerous , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him .
But he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ;
Linda Evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed Bobbie's death could move her to feeling .
For Linda knew how to help her husband , not just the Stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners for Reuben Lovejoy .
They had their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk .
`` Now , I believe Poor John'll work just a little harder .
In some ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing I was no longer obligated to Nadine ! !
I stumbled through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour .
Her face was flushed from sleep .
I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' .
`` I have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on .
`` I'll answer it '' .
There was a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying .
She didn't even give me a chance to refuse .
So I told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment .
I opened the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him .
Nadine strode over to him , and her pointed nails raked across his face .
`` How can you be so damn stupid ? ?
Wally can't go any place at this hour '' --
I got her into bed , and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out .
Wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry .
Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , Wally confessed , and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired .
There is one big way we can help them .
But it would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out '' .
`` That isn't like you , Janice '' , Chris said uncomfortably .
I didn't want to be like that , mean and bitter .
Nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed .
`` You can get something , '' Nadine would snap .
`` You can get a job working in a grocery store , if nothing else '' .
I don't really believe in intuition .
But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day .
For the thousandth time , I wished I'd chosen some nice , nine-to-five , five-days-a-week profession .
Should I tell him the truth about Alice ? ?
The ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female alcoholics .
`` Have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? ?
`` Better do a Papanicolaou '' , I told Pete .
`` There's something there , all right .
`` Well , better see what I can do '' .
But she seemed to be dozing and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones .
Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , I felt an inward shiver .
I looked at her in amazement .
She smiled , a smile without humor .
`` I've got cancer , haven't I '' ? ?
Just let me die in peace '' .
I stared at her , almost speechless .
Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was .
A long , long way down .
Again there was something familiar about her , something --
Just let me outta here '' --
`` Where have you been all these years '' ? ?
Let me outta here ! !
You doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good ? ?
And Gladdy would be safe ! !
I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea .
the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic .
The metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water .
I had a pocketful of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night .
I felt like a Hun in Rome .
All the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ;
There were some sweet machines other than women : an old Bugatti , a lean Farina coachwork on an American chassis , a Swallow , a type A40-AjK Mercedes and lots more .
Now it was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when I returned .
I read the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer .
My head was clear , my thinking sober and I was reconciled to this Paris idea as a flop on top of all my others .
Without it she would have been drab and limp .
She was another human being and happened to be a hustler .
I didn't much care if she were there or not .
She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? ?
She was trying to make a hole in my armor , and I didn't want it .
This took me so funny I had to look at her .
She smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile .
Anyway , I pulled a bottle of Remy Martin out of my topcoat , drew the cork , and passed it to her .
It's really rotten to drink good cognac like that , but I hadn't cared before .
I couldn't be sure .
We finished the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober .
She had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side .
My head was clear .
I gave it to the woman .
I know men never kiss les putains '' .
I put aside my empty cup .
We were not rushed .
Pictures in old Latin books returned to her : the Appian Way Today , the Colosseum , the Arch of Constantine .
The very night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now I can go .
The Spanish Steps .
And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway ? ?
Cousin Emma had simply put Miss Theresa Stubblefield , Rome , Italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka , Alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor .
Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago .
I'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh .
His own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his grandchildren ( he had one so far , still in diapers ) , he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all .
A life of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand .
Theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George .
`` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to ! !
`` You might treat it like the hiccups '' , said Papa .
`` Drop a cold key down his back '' .
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' .
But there is more in this than meets the eye .
I may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best .
Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two .
The lady with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ;
It never registered with them that I had time to read all of Balzac , Dickens , and Stendhal while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after Mother's operation .
She became aware that two Italian workmen , carrying a large azalea pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display .
And I've been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren .
My folks and my faith protected me from things like that .
I asked him if it was true .
Honest , kitten , that's all it is -- I don't even like Lucille much '' .
My love for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't hesitate to use her sex .
Johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line .
He wasn't only different -- he was it .
I could hardly believe such good luck was mine .
`` Who drinks far too much '' .
`` And smokes too much '' .
`` Or I could visit Lucille Warren '' .
So one week later , I surrendered to him in the little motel on Route 10 .
I was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the clutches of Lucille Warren .
And , though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered .
Outside , in the summertime fields behind the motel , a thousand crickets serenaded us .
I took great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness .
I felt no conflict between what I was doing and my strict religious upbringing .
Wouldn't Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? ?
No price is too high when true love is at stake .
And hadn't I rescued him from Lucille Warren ? ?
`` Always '' .
A chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow .
But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group .
By the time we arrived , the party was already going strong .
`` She's invisible tonight .
`` I -- I don't think so , Ronald .
`` Okay .
Strange faces , most of them , and I wasn't even sure all of them had come from the League meeting .
`` You share a refrigerator '' , Mrs. Kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from New York in pelting rain , that had sounded reasonable .
It was still raining , and Mrs. Kirby's cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and magenta .
The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked .
He had loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever , which was really piling it on .
`` Ah '' .
`` You've got a peaked look .
Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , Peony being less than weatherproof .
He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy .
His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ;
Everything being the sweater , a lipstick case , and a squirt bottle of Kissin' Kare pink hand lotion .
The note paper was pink , too , and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine .
Not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol .
Yes , take Vivian .
They would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid , chic and splashy , like Vivian herself .
Pink , Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy .
It was Mrs. Kirby , making her toilsome way along the veranda , laden with a clattery collection of mops , brushes , and pails .
`` Oh , nothing .
She scrutinized him .
You want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash , first sunny day .
Hardly an inviting description .
Charlie looked in the mirror .
He looked more closely .
Clearly , two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good .
The note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript : `` You're not at all well , are you '' ? ?
She didn't sound like a pale girl .
She sounded a little like a redhead .
Up on a dune , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting .
`` You're having a miserable time , aren't you ? ?
Use all the lotion you want , and for goodness' sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days '' .
She felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ;
Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn ? ?
`` That Mrs. Kirby ! !
but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister .
The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop .
Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil .
Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag .
Only Mike got to his feet .
They poured water over their catcher's face .
Then the manager called for a doctor .
Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching .
When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch '' .
`` You didn't have to ram him '' .
It was a cold and calculated look .
He called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston .
`` They're looking for trouble '' .
Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started .
`` It's a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy's own team-mate won't come out and help him in a fight '' .
Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil .
`` Nobody else did , either '' .
But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room .
This is the second time .
`` Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are .
The heart , Phil .
You just haven't got the heart for pro-ball , and that's it '' .
Dazed , Phil said : `` I don't get it .
Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there .
`` I think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally .
Frankie asked .
Phil was very quiet .
`` Ask Whitey for a job '' .
`` I'll speak to Whitey '' .
`` Atta boy '' .
`` You'll get a job there .
When he was twelve he took to reading St. Augustine and Aquinas , then Lao-tse , Confucius , Mencius , Suzuki , Hindu tomes by endless Krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers .
Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again .
His interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian affairs .
She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you'd like it '' .
Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried .
He stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water .
In Charlotte , Richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which , after a fashion , he envied .
She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations .
`` Well , it's at Fudomae and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool .
You've never been to Ryusenji '' ? ?
`` There's a little place there called Lovers Mound dedicated to Gompachi and Komurasaki '' .
`` There was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' --
`` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns .
It would kill one of us '' .
`` But the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji , all in worship of Fudo , the god of fire '' .
He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool .
I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings .
He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips .
I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful .
The sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target .
The boy was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience .
Stop it , I shouted , but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say .
It was no use .
I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ;
He was my nephew , my brother's son , handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well .
I saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something there where I had been not long before .
`` Yes '' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement .
`` Snakes are ugly and bad '' .
`` You saw the colors of it , didn't you ? ?
The boy skipped along beside me , and he was contented with what he had done .
I wrenched the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body , between the colored diamond crystals .
The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips .
I could see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the gleeful brutality .
I wanted to slap his face , to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth , and I decided then , very suddenly , what I would do .
His son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life .
Look at Pete Alcorn , who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years .
Pete's son was rejected .
Getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking .
He put down his pipe and started to type .
He didn't have to be told his son looked like him .
David had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness .
Health , excellent .
`` His interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics , tennis and swimming .
His eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic .
Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything .
Anne had it .
She never got on his back .
When I went to college they begged you to come .
He's president of the rocket club here , you know .
Real bright along those lines , you might say .
From those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did .
`` Can I have the car , Dad '' ? ?
Cady Partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse .
`` I didn't know I looked so dilapidated '' ! !
`` In a way , yes .
`` Anything else '' ? ?
It isn't like you .
David's interests .
`` But he plays bass with Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' ! !
Even in that he never solos like Jack on guitar or Rich on sax .
He's -- he's just there , that's all '' .
Don't worry , Cady , he'll be back in the Beethoven fold by next year '' .
`` All right .
But I refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' .
`` Maybe I am padding it a bit , Anne '' , he said .
`` I have talked to him , but you know I've never tried to push him into any profession .
`` Dave has qualities of leadership .
Cady walked the block to the mailbox , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne .
Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all .
The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life .
Half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things .
The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals .
More he could take at leisure .
But , at the start , his new life felt invigorating .
He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous .
She'll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings .
He could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to retrieve the shorts .
Martin turned his back .
A glissade of giggles slid over their voices .
The Brainards went home early .
On the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant .
He shivered .
Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ?
It was curious how the different visitors took this .
To them all Dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale .
`` It's a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course .
Dolores smiled ; ;
The sound of their amazement .
The most bizarre situation .
he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure .
Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers .
Sooner or later , Dolores would crack .
The next morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of nylon lace pants , and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts .
In a surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared .
Slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second .
They breakfasted together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible .
Probably Mr. Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren .
Feeling his power , Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer .
Heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him .
Mr. Willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington .
In the end , he said : `` I'm not enchanted by the proposition , sir .
Besides that , I'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the Air Force .
I think Adam Herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side .
Here are a few facts and figures I've assembled .
Once more Willis summoned William .
Freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me .
William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick .
He thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult .
Taking Hamrick with him , William went to Mr. Willis .
`` Your alternative is breathtaking '' , he said , `` and , I'm frank in saying , a bit mad .
Well , I can't resolve this myself .
If they follow anyone , it'll have to be you '' .
`` I should explain : there's more here for me than advocating my little dream , there's you .
You're -- you're Arthur Willis .
Forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' .
`` Thank you '' .
William said .
`` I don't enjoy family quarrels '' , Adam said .
`` There's plenty of risk money '' , Ham Richert added , `` but not for anything this risky '' .
`` We'll try to swing the deal on that basis .
Heads instinctively turned in Willis' direction .
`` Hello , boss '' , he said , and grinned .
For it seems that Barco , fancying himself a ladies' man ( and why not , after seven marriages ? ?
During the return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` They're under sand dunes They're better off , I tell you I saved their souls '' .
Welch wanted to know why .
The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test .
His manhood had been attacked .
`` Is that so '' ? ?
Barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on .
Stopping the cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills , and indicated a location .
Welch was worried .
The police captain chortled .
Joking stopped and everyone gathered around .
He was bitter and resentful toward her , personally resentful .
She arrived late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; ;
the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor .
The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined .
I couldn't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her .
I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats .
In fact , it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi .
But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` chi-chi '' in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home .
Louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency .
No .
What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink .
We didn't even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after I met Fran at a PTA meeting , and had taken us in hand socially .
They had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; ;
Herb , an expert on narrow ties , thin lapels , and swatches , was men's fashion editor of Parvenu , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation .
They were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in Parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they honeymooned in Bermuda .
No , not Bermuda .
Their house was a centuries-old Colonial which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and updated , and added on to .
She always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy , and that Koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs .
Yes , Blanche was very , very sweet -- being in her company was like being drowned in warm , melted marshmallows .
Francesca and Grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen , equal bosses , of whatever PTA or civic project was being launched .
She lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration , appointments , paint , and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring ; ;
all were fellows of finite charm .
These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gazed , misty-eyed with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting .
I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85,000 yearly ; ;
They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were .
They're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast '' .
'' My impassioned plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the Eddie Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis .
The savage barbarian hordes of red Russian Communism descended on the Athens that was mighty Metronome , sacking and despoiling with their Bolshevistic battle cry of `` Soak the rich ' ! !
The litigation was costly and seemingly endless .
I was ready , like Portia , to present my own brief .
My plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out '' .
Not only were the court costs prohibitive , but I was subjected to crippling fines , in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid `` debts '' which the government claimed that Metronome and I owed -- a severe financial blow .
My enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` robber baroness '' , and even `` traitor '' ! !
It was I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even Letch's bills at his tailor and the Los Angeles Athletic Club .
`` Ah , you're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' .
Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter .
)
a lovely Epiphany party at Errol Flynn's , on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown `` starlet '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could .
Whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , uncooperative , rude and insulting .
Only George Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss Poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood '' .
( An actor must have discipline .
At the same time , however , I availed myself of the services of that great English actor and master of make-up , Sir Gauntley Pratt , to do a `` quickie '' called The Mystery of the Mad Marquess , in which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac .
I really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to Momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me .
As a result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready .

Did older people work more slowly ? ?
Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ? ?
They could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn .
On some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered .
He didn't even ask the cost of this collection .
He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall .
Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot .
He didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly .
Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk .
At the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance .
That ain't too bad 'ceptin' the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin' '' .
Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression .
Mr. Crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing .

Ben Franklin said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. Fogg .
`` I see the girl but I don't see the car with slacks on '' .
In one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman : `` Excuse me , but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter's handbag and my wife's behind '' .
The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical .
Strangely enough , this always brought the house down .
Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case .
After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the record : `` Shot in the woods '' .
The girl nodded understandingly .
`` It's only that I like to know where you go '' .
`` What have you got on today '' ? ?
She inquired .
`` Who's in it '' ? ?
`` I am '' , he said .
`` Oh '' , said the woman , `` I've seen that picture already '' .
In the comedy of indefinite reference , it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence .
It-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit .
`` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live .
There are even publications called Sick and Mad .
it is manic as a man '' .
`` Just barely '' , he said , and repeated his paraphrase : `` The time has come '' , the walrus said , `` To speak of manic things , Of shots and shouts , and sealing dooms Of commoners and kings '' .
I took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` I admit that going back to Ralph Waldo Emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy '' .
Moreland asked , grimly .
`` Cryptic '' , I said .
`` They require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? ?

We sat for a while drinking in silence .
`` But you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of James and the antic heyday of Coward .
I myself hear it said constantly -- in drawing-rooms .
Moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which I made each of us a new drink .
It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said .
`` If you saw the drama called Rhinoceros '' , I said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros .
It consists in saying , ' That would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage .
`` Such as '' ? ?
`` The other day Arnold Toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else .
Arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by .
He was very rude .
But this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' .
and so they were consistently true to their principles .
I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' .
`` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British movie .
They had protested that that wasn't any surprise .
She would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously .
She held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked .
`` Imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said .
It all has something to do with General Burnside and his horse '' .
He's old '' .
But it was even funnier after they had been told .
But not General Burnside .
He never could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet .
But that wasn't very funny , either .
She also taught them to sing `` I wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate '' .
`` Imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , Arlene suggested .

The Albany Civic Opera's presentation of Spumoni's immortal Il Sevigli del Spegititgninino , with guest contralto Hattie Sforzt .

For example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed through middle-Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) .
For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a Venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag .
The effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at times a bit obscure , the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer .
The music of Bini SalFininistas , capital LP Ab63711-r , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer .
Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ;
For example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F-major register up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at the same time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage .

Fing , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir Cedric Hardwicke , is responsible for the rediscovery of Verdi's earliest , most raucous opera , Nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the Mudugno version of `` Volare '' .
Bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself '' ( De Gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' ! !
i.e. , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot-slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home .
Far from it ; ;
Quite candidly , fellows , I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the rice in China .
Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box Kodaks , you added to your haul .
In time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's evil , sheep rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release .
